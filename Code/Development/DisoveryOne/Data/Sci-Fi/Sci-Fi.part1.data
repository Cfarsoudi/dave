Armageddon

FADE IN

Blackness. Then a hint of green becomes EARTH. It lies across an 
expanse of  space. Richly colored. Fertile.

A GIGANTIC ASTEROID cuts into frame, Burning into EARTH'S 
ATMOSPHERE and  striking down in the currant area of Guzumel, 
Mexico.

Voice An impact equivalent to ten thousand nuclear weapons 
detonating  simultaneously.

A HUGE DINOSAUR FOOT steps down hard and is VAPORIZED with a 
deafening ROAR.

Voice One hundred trillion tons of dirt and rock hurled into the 
atmosphere. 

EARTH, seen from space, is rocked with an IMMENSE SHOCKWAVE. A 
SHEET OF DEBRIS  washes across the North and South Hemispheres.

Voice A blanket of dust the sun is powerless to penetrate. For 
five thousand  years our world is robbed of light as a nuclear 
winter falls. In that darkness,  a civilisation is removed from 
existence.

EARTH is now completely entombed in a dark, cold hell. Letters 
push towards us--

"A R M A G E D D O N"

65 MILLION YEARS LATER

EARTH, reflected off the face of ASTRONAUT PETE SHELBY'S HELMET. 
It appears  close enough to touch. Shelby, attached to SHUTTLE 
ATLANTIS BY LIFELINE,  struggles to replace a piece of the 
shuttle's operational arm.

Shelby 
(with radio squawking)
 Houston, I can't get this thing to work...

EXT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY

Golden The size of Texas. In a hub of computers and tracking 
equipment, we find DAN GOLDEN, former  Astronaut from Apollo 8 
(first crew to orbit the Moon)
 and now N.A.S.A's  second-in-command. Golden is watching Shelby 
on a SERIES OF VIDEO SCREENS.  FLIGHT DIRECTOR WALTER CLARK sits 
with rows of N.A.S.A Techs. Golden stands over  him, arms on the 
back o his chair.

Clark Atlantis, what's the problem?

Shelby 
(V.0)
 It just isn't working. Any suggestions?

Clarke Hang on Pete. We'll figure something out for you.

Golden taps Clark and sits down.

Golden 
(to Shelby)
 We got the top scientific minds in the world working on  this. 
(a slight smile)
 Try "whacking" the thing. 

Shelby Okay, Houston, commence whacking.

Selby begins Whacking the satellite with his glove. The SATELLITE 
comes n-line,  lights up like a Christmas tree.

A HORRIFYING RUMBLING SOUND. SHOTGUN LIKE PELLETS assault the 
satellite.  SHRAPNEL rips into it's delicate gold skin. The 
satellite EXPLODES. Shelby's  lifeline breaks; he spins off, suit 
leaking from twenty punctures.

(plaid shirts, glasses)
 that signal the painful fact that they  are die-hard science 
nerds THEO'S POV - THROUGH WKU TELESCOPE - Far off in space  is a 
dusty, murky swarm of matter - something resembling a FLOATING 
EXPLOSION.

Jimbo When are we going to let N.A.S.A in on what we've found?

Theo We don't even know what we have yet. Comet, asteroid - it 
could be  anything up there. And don't be so eager to red flag 
N.A.S.A. They don't call us  when they discover anything.

Jimbo Yeah, but this is their sandbox were playing in.

Theo This is our discovery. We're going to hold a press 
conference. We're  going to be famous. SPACEWATCH'll name this 
thing after us. Job offers are going  to fly in from all the big 
companies. J.P.L., that think tank up at M.I.T., hell  even 
N.A.S.A. 'll be chasing us.

Pearl I'm going on Oprah, Larry King, Letterman...

Jimbo Hell with them, I'm going on Howard Stern....

Pearl 
(concentrating)
 This things really acting up tonight. We should find out  if 
anyone else knows about this.

Theo How?

Jimbo 
(master of factly)
 Call N.A.S.A

Theo And say what? "Hi, we're a couple astronomer geeks who found 
something  really bitchin; floatin' in space." You can't just 
call N.A.S.A. It's like  calling the White House. Besides, you'll 
never get the number.

Jimbo I have the number. I got it from "Mega monster."

Pearl Who?

Jimbo He's some super-hacker, I went to high school with. Guy's 
totally wired  into every encrypted government installation.

Theo He's also an ex-con.

Jimbo They never proved he shut down the power in those seven

Flip Yeah, Mission Control.

Jimbo 
(into phone)
 Uhh hi, I'm an astronomer in Kentucky, and I was wondering  if 
you guys had seen some strange activity in the southern middle 
quadrant of  the asteroid belt between Antares Major and Epsilom 
Scorpio....

TECHNICIANS are all  talking at once.

Golden Okay guys, one of the worst days in N.A..S.A history just 
got worse.  Ten million to one. A rogue comet came from deep 
space and collided with an  asteroid. Some  kids actually got a 
picture of the collision event and told no one.  The stuff that 
hit this morning was the collision's forward-thrown matter, mere  
pebbles from what's  about to come. Walter? 

Clark A big asteroid. E.T.A., eighteen days. A lot bigger than 
the five mile  one that obliterated the dinosaurs.

Silence. Everybody stares at each other.

the Directors of  the N.A.S.A., C.I.A., etc.

Temple Dan, we're all here. Tell us what we're up against. 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 In it's simplest terms? The end of Mankind. One asteroid, one  
mile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force 
of all the  nuclear weapons in the  world, times a thousand. Half 
our population will die within 24  hours from tidal waves and 
heat pulses. The other half won't be so lucky. In the  end, it 
will be men  eating the flesh of other men. 
(beat)
 It's not the end of the  world, General, the world - Earth - 
will still be here. But there will be no  life - maybe 
cockroaches and  some resilient strands of bacteria. 

Temple Well, that's really positive, Dan. The President just got 
off the phone  with the Russians. They're just about to launch a 
new Mars Probe on the biggest  rocket in the world.  Golden and 
the N.A.S.A. BRASS exchange sceptical looks.

Golden 
(V.O)
 With the worst guidance system in the world. Their Mars Probe in  
'96 was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa. 

Temple They're going to pull off the probe and replace it with 
four Atlas  Class IV nuclear warheads. Enough punch in their 
opinion - not to break it up -  but to slow it down enough to 
miss Earth's orbit. 

Golden 
(V.O)
 Their launch date is set for next month.

Temple They're going to move it up.

Golden 
(V.O)
 To when?

Temple Sixteen hours from now.

All the N.A.S.A. Technicians CLAMOR at once.

Golden 
(V.O)
 What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it together?  
Even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear 
detonation is not  going to work.  The only way is to split the 
thing in half and hope the two pieces  slide past us. 

Temple Thank you for bringing up the impossible, Dan.

Colinswood People, the President's joining us, Mr. President?

President 
(V.O)
 Well, this has been a tough day. The media's all over this.  
They're going to get nothing. Telling the public we might all be 
dead in  eighteen days achieves nothing but panic. 

Golden 
(V.O)
 Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing  
to do unless you have the exact co-ordinates. There are only 
twelve telescopes  powerful enough  to see it right now. You've 
got a full moon goin' for four days -  makes it all but 
impossible to see.. Once these things draw closer to Earth,  
you'll never keep a lid on  this. No way. 

INT. N.A.S.A. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

The video screen blinks off. Golden looks at his Techs.

Golden How many of you are as scared as I am?

Golden raises his hand. All the other N.A.S.A. Techs, one by one, 
raise their  hands.

Golden One giant leap for Mankind. Everyone remember that? This 
is what we are  going to do. We're going to fly to that asteroid 
with a nuclear device, implant  it and get off  before it blows. 
Quincy? 

All eyes turn to N.A.S.A. Chief of R&D, RONALD QUINCY. Quincy has 
coke bottle  glasses and a 198 I.Q.

Quincy Look: set a fire cracker off in your open palm, you get a 
third degree  burn. Close your fist, It'll do some serious 
damage. If we can get a nuke deep  in one of the asteroid's fault 
lines, she'll split in two, like a diamond. 

Golden You're all looking art us like we're crazy. We're not.

Skip Dan, our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow.

Golden What I'm going to tell you is a breach of national 
security and could  land me in jail, but in eighteen days there 
arnt' gonna be any jails,  so....We're not gonna use a  current 
shuttle. Gentlemen, I'm talking about the X-71.

from an oil  rig. The "TROLL" is the largest man-made structure 
in the world - 12 aircraft  carriers big and 1200 feet tall. A 
self-contained city. 

HARRY STAMPER, world's foremost expert on offshore deep drilling, 
immaculately  attired in golf attire and spikes, stands on a

Grace I just talked with A.J.

Harry Talking to him quite a bit these days....

Grace 
(awkward pause)
 "A" rig's acting up. The drill string kicked twice this

Harry Good. He's not vulnerable there.

Grace Chase Manhatten okayed the bridge financing for the 
Micronesia Project,  but at 21 percent interest. And Lloyd's of 
London refuses to underwrite the  Venezuela> Project....  

Harry Thieves and cowards, all of 'em. Twist their arms.

Grace I am.

Harry Keep twisting. Like a pit bull.

Grace Oh, and that magazine article - they want some human 
interest stuff -  likes and dislikes. "Likes" I said Golf, Fly 
Fishing, Single Malt Scotch, Old  Movies. What about  "Dislikes?"

Harry Any kind of flying and oil company executives. Go deal with 
'em. I  always look better when you're doing the talking.

Harry HITS another ball. CLANG.

Grace You know you donate 300 grand a year to Greenpeace.

Harry smiles at the contradiction.

Harry What'd your mother call me?

Grace Complicated.

Harry Yeah well....I'm complicated.

Grace walks off, passing A.J., winking at him. A.J. winks back.

A.J. What's his mood?

Grace Complicated.

A.J. walks up to Harry.

Harry I understand we're having problems with "A" rig.

 Harry, you have a second?

Harry Yeah. One.

A.J. I'll hurry. I've worked for you for a long time.

Harry Twelve years.

A.J. And you've been real good to me....

Harry Another company make you an offer, kid?

A.J. No. The reason I am here, today, standing here, talking to 
you. I'm  obviously talking to you...but it's, you know, not, 
uhh...it's not an  oil-related matter exactly....

Harry You're sweating, A.J.

A.J. You know there comes a time in a man's life when...
(to himself)
 No,  that's a cliché...
(to Harry)
 Can I start again? I, uhh, fell...I've fallen...

Harry You hurt yourself?

A.J. In love, I mean. Fallen in love. It's the damnedest thing, 
but this  person you...know...really well.

ACROSS THE PLATFORM - Grace escorts five angry OIL INDUSTRY 
EXECUTIVES over to  Harry. A KLAXON SOUNDS. Harry, alarmed, 
rushes right past them, toward the "A"  Derrick. They follow, 
snapping at his heels

Oil Executive 1 You explicitly promised results at 25 thousand 
feet.

Harry We have results.

Oil Executive 2 But we don't have oil. We've given you everything 
you've  asked....

Harry Horseshit. What the...? Chick! Bennie! Somebody better tell 
me why the  hell "A" derrick is not turning!

Chick hurries up to Harry.

Chick The uhh....the Greenpeace guys.

Harry approaches "A" Derrick. Five MEMBERS of Greenpeace have 
handcuffed  themselves in a circle around the drilling pipe.

Harry Hey there, what can I do for you?

Greenpeace Leader This is an official protest.

Harry 'Course it is. I love you guys. You like dolphins and 
whales, I like 'em  too. Hey, I know you. You too. Didn't you 
have shorter hair?

Greenpeace Leader Stamper, do you know what this thing does to 
the eco-system?

Harry How'd you get out here? Canoe? Rowboat? Oh, that boat down 
there with a  thousand horsepower diesel!

Greenpeace Leader How can you wake up every day and look at 
yourself in the  mirror?

Harry The same way you did when you blow-dried your hair this 
morning. And you  used a curling iron, I betcha. Did you know 
most electricity's from burning oil?  I'' stop drillin' when the 
world - stops usin' it. Bennie, start 'er up! 

Greenpeace Leader Wait........

Harry Can't wait! I'm a businessman! Those goons over there gave 
me 57 mil. to  find oil and they ain't leavin' till I do! 'cause 
they have no lives! 

The drill string begins to turn in the hole.

Greenpeace Leader We....we threw away the key.

Harry Sorry. Time is money. BENNIE!

The MASSIVE HYDRAULIC KELLY begins to descend on the Greenpeace 
Activists'  heads.

Greenpeace Leader STOP!!!!

Harry Bennie! Third gear!

The Greenpeace Leader miraculously produces a key and frantically 
begins  unlocking the handcuffs.

Grace turns to the oil executives.

Grace He's good at public relations.

A.J. approaches Grace; they watch Harry.

Grace So? 
(A.J. stares at her)
 What? 
(no response)
 What? 
(no response)
 A.J.?

Suddenly, across "A" Derrick, a KLAXON SOUNDS.

Chick She's kickin'!

The civilians get the hell away.

Harry and A.J. run toward the rig.

Chick Pressure's north of seven thousand!

A.J. We gotta clear the Derrick!

Harry 
(looks at wellhead)
 Chick, rig up another pipe. 
(Chick and Bennie look  at Harry with uncertainty)
 NOW, NOT TOMORROW. 

CHick and Bennie begin clamping, and tong a PIPE STRAND onto the 
DRILL STRING  like an INDY PIT STOP CREW.

A.J. Harry, we've hit pressure. We gotta bleed it off. e go any 
deeper, we'll  blow the rig.

Harry Thanks for that opinion. Chick, full speed!

A.J. The bit's five thousand feet down! Full speed'll rip the 
pipe apart!

Harry You learn all this in college? I been doing this thirty 
years, kid. Get  on the controls.

A.J. moves reluctantly to the DRILLING CONTROLS. Chick nods to 
A.J., who engages  the gears. The PIPE STRING turns at FULL 
SPEED. The new drill pipe descends ten  feet into the hole, 
then....

The torque rips the NEWLY ATTACHED PIPE from the drilling string. 
The drill  spins freely.

A.J. hits the "stop! lever and stares at Harry.

The roughnecks converge around the wellhead.

A.J. I'm goin' down. Reattach it. Gimme a wrench and a band 
coupling.

Chick hand the items to A.J.

A.J. descends into the drilling hole.

INT. DOWN THE DRILLING HOLE - DAY

A.J., holding his breath under water, shimmies down the drilling 
pipe  feet-first, inside the water-filled concrete tube running 
from the rig to the  ocean floor. 

A.J. begins wrestling the disconnected sections together. EXT. 
RIG - "A" DERRICK

The wellhead KICKS. The rig platform shakes and shudders. 
SEAWATER erupts from  the wellhead.

Chick The drill hole's flooding!

Grace A.J.!!

Harry strips off his jacket and climbs into the wellhead. He 
takes a huge breath  and disappears into the brine-filled 
drilling hole. 

INT. DRILLING HOLE

A.J. is pinned against the hole wall by one of the disconnected 
pipes. Harry  comes down the hole. He plants his back against the 
hole wall and kicks the  pipe, freeing A.J. A slow, deep, RUMBLE 
emanates from below. The Briny water  inside the hole suddenly 
turns BLACK and VISCOUS. 

A.J. and Harry exchange an alarmed look. Harry, then A.J., pull 
for the surface,  up the drilling hole as -- 

EXT. DRILLING PLATFORM - "A" DERRICK - DAY

-- the wellhead KICKS again. The rig platform SHUDDERS violently. 
The derrick  sways. SEAWATER SPEWS up from the wellhead. 

Chick Get back, she's gonna blow!

Grace, Chick, Bennie and the other Roughnecks huddle around the 
flooded drilling  hole, waiting. Tense, agonising seconds pass. 

Harry scrambles out, covered in....CRUDE OIL.

He grabs Grace and pulls her away.

Grace Where's A.J.!!!?

Harry RIGHT BEHIND ME! RUN!

The platform SHAKES. Harry, Grace, and the others sprint away as 
--

A GEYSER OF CRUDE OIL erupts from the drilling hole, blowing A.J. 
out of the  hole fifteen feet above the wellhead. A.J. crashes to 
the platform floor. 

CRUDE OIL rains down on Grace and the Roughnecks...they run to 
A.J.

Grace Never do that again!

CLOSE ON A.J. - he's looking back at the DRILL HOLE, panting, 
traumatised,  greasy oil raining on his head.

A.J. You know how I told you there were two obstacles? I didn't 
do the  first,'cause he's tough...but I did the second...! 
(pulls out case; opens it)
 I  got it at uhm..Tiffany's. I can't give it to you until I talk 
to him, but try it on. 

She reaches for the ring. It slips from A.J.'s hand and falls 
through the grated  floor, pinging off the rig's steel pylons, 
100 feet into the sea below. 

Grace Don't worry! Tiffany's insures up to a week from purchase!

A.J. stares despondently over the railing.

Harry, black with crude oil, staggers past A.J.

A.J. 
(pointedly)
 Good plan, Harry.

Harry 
(walks over to Oil Execs)
 There's your oil, gentlemen. Now get the hell  off my rig.

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY

Golden, Clark, Skip, Flip and the rest of the Mission Control 
Technicians watch  a live feed from Russia. A RUSSIAN ENERGIA 
SUPER BOOSTER ROCKET sits on its  launch platform. 

Flip Look it that sucker. They got a nuke up there in sixteen 
hours?

Skip It'll never fly. Never.

Clark Three things the Russians make well, guys - vodka, gymnasts 
and rockets.  Don't count 'em out.

Golden It's the late 20th century, I run the U.S. Space Program, 
and I'm  praying to God the Russians are better at this than we 
are.... 

EXT. RUSSIA SPACE CENTER - SMOLINSKAYA A.F. BASE - DAY

The ground begins to SHAKE uncontrollably. EXHAUST billows out 
from the Rocket's  BOOSTERS. The Russian rocket blasts off and 
lifts into.... 

Something's wrong. The Rocket stops accelerating and stands still 
for a moment.  It falls to Earth; BLOWING UP in a thunderous 
inferno. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY

Golden, Clark, and all the N.A.S.A. Techs stare at the burning 
rocket.

Golden So, where's our oil driller?

EXT. RIG - "A" DERRICK

A champagne cork POPS and WIDEN TO Harry, Grace, A.J., and all 
fifty Roughnecks.  The wellhead's been capped; pumping 2500 
gallons per minute. 

Harry To Hole Number Seventy-Six!

Roughnecks 
(UNISON)
 Hole Number Seventy-Six!

The Oil Executives stand off, watching.

Oil Executive 1 Seventy-Six?

Oil Executive 2 This is Harry's Seventy-Sixth straight hit.

Oil Executive 1 The man's a legend.

We hear the WHOP, WHOP, WHOP of HELICOPTER BLADES. Harry, Grace 
and A.J. turn  toward the noise.

TWO U.S. ARMY BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS whirr across the choppy 
ocean.

EXT. OIL RIG - TOP TIER HELI-PAD - MINUTES LATER

The helicopters land on the heli-pad on the oil rig's top tier, 
MAJOR STINSON,  50's, wearing formal dress and sunglasses along 
with two strapping ADJUTANTS  stride across the rig. 

Major Stinson Harry Stamper? I'm Major William Stinson, United 
States Army. I  need a few words with you. In private.

Harry Say it now, say it quick, or get off my rig, Major. I've 
got a business  to run here.

Major Stinson You've been summoned back to the States.

Harry Who's doin' the summoning?

Major Stinson Your Government, Mr Stamper.

INT. SOMEPLACE IN KENTUCKY - HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

Jimbo, Theo and Pearl sit in a holding cell some place. Jimbo's 
banging on the  door.

Jimbo Hey, zipperheads! Ever watch "L.A. Law?" Right to remain 
silent, right  to an attorney? My brother's a bad-ass lawyer - 
he's gonna sue your asses to  Mars. I was in pre-  law for a 
month - you can't put somebody in jail for makin' a phone  
call!!! 

Pearl It isn't about that, Jimbo. We saw something we weren't 
supposed to.

Theo Something they're not telling the public.

Jimbo Yeah, that's why they were so hot for the co-ordinates. Do 
you think  it's an asteroid? Or comet?

Theo I dunno - but I bet it's a whopper.

INT. N.A.S.A. FLIGHT MISSION ROOM - DAY

Harry, AJ. and Grace are led into the room by Stinson. Quincy's 
eyes move to  Harry --

Quincy He's here.

Quincy, Clark and Golden stand, approach --

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 Dan Golden, meet Mister Harry Stamper, the finest oil driller  
in the world.

Golden Mister Stamper..
(shaking hands)
 Dan Golden, I'm Director of --

Harry I know who you are. I watched T.V. once. Apollo 8, right? 
First manned  lunar orbit.

Golden That was a long time ago. I run this place now. And we've 
got a serious  problem on our hands that Quincy here thinks you 
might be able to help us out  with -- 

Quincy eagerly outstretches his hand. They shake. Quincy doesn't 
let go.

Quincy I'm a big fan, Mr. Stamper.

Harry I kinda caught that. 
(to Golden)
 What's the problem, gentlemen?

Golden I wonder if we might speak alone?

Harry These two are my right and left arms. Grace Stamper and 
Albert Jack  Frost. Stupid name, so we call him A.J.. 
(handshakes)
 They run my company. You  talk to me, you  talk to them. 

Golden Okay.

Golden direct everyone into --

INT. N.A.S.A. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Golden, Temple, Clark, Harry, Grace, and A.J. sit in a dark room 
viewing a  VIDEOTAPE. Quincy stands beside the projector, 
supplying narration. On the tape  we see Harry on a rig platform 
shaking hands with an ARAB BUSINESSMAN -- 

Harry Great, home movies.

Grace and A.J. smile.

Quincy Nineteen eighty five. The first well drilled over 50 
thousand feet.  They said it couldn't be done. You did it. 
Incredible. 

ON THE SCREEN - Harry's on another rig, shaking hands with an 
INDONESIAN  BUSINESSMAN. Harry leans over and kisses the bit. The 
Businessmen shake their  heads, awed. 

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 Nineteen Ninety-One. Directional drilling through two miles of  
anthracite. They also said that couldn't be done. You did it. 
Incredible. 

Harry looks at Quincy strangely; this sure is a bizarre form of 
celebrity.

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 Ninteen Ninety-Three. The first hole over seventy thousand.  
Once again they said --

Golden Move it along, Quincy.

Quincy Right, sorry. Mister Stamper, you're the world's foremost 
expert in  deep drilling. You hold specialized patents in high 
speed bits, drilling fluids,  downhole motors Can I call you 
Harry? 

Harry Stick with Stamper.

Golden Well, Mister Stamper, we need you to drill a hole. It's in 
a difficult  place.

Harry I've drilled in them all.

Golden Not...this place. This is really out there. 
(beat)
 Space, Mister  Stamper.

Harry As in...outer?

SATELLITE PHOTOS OF THE ASTEROID come up on the screen --

Temple You've watched the news the last 24 hours? You heard about 
the meteor  shower? 
(Harry nods)
 What you don't know is that an asteroid is on a collision  
course with  Earth. If it hits us, Earth as we know it will be 
over. 

Golden We're manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a 
nuclear device in  it's core. To do that we need to drill an 
eight hundred foot hole. 

Harry looks at A.J. and Grace.

Harry A.J., is this guy shitting me?

A.J. I don't think they shit people at N.A.S.A., Harry --

Harry An eight hundred foot hole. On a moving asteroid. In space.

Golden All we want is your advice in perfecting our drilling arm, 
any help you  can provide. We'll pay your usual consultancy, of 
course.  

Harry Show me your rig.

INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

Quincy leads Golden, Harry, A.J., Grace, and Clark through 
N.A.S.A.'s Research  and Development area. This place looks like 
"Q's" weapons shop from the James  Bond movies as funded by every 
company on the fortune 500 -- 

Huge, clinically clean, dominated by MASSIVE ROCKET ENGINES. 
TECHNICIANS in  white coats and hairnets work on a variety of 
equipment. 

TECHNICIANS hunch over a ROVER VEHICE, not the golf cart used on 
the moon. This  is low, squat, sturdy, with an enclosed airlocked 
passenger compartment. 

Quincy The "Armadillo" - our fourth generation rover. It carries 
a six-cell  solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint 
venture with the Germans. 
(winks)
  It's designed by Porsche. 

Quincy motions to TWO TECHNICIANS. They roll over a ROBOTIC ARM 
on a gurney,  powered by an ELECTRIC MOTOR. The robotic arm is 
connected to an OIL DRILLING  BIT. 

Harry Where's the Kelly?

Quincy This baby works without one.

Harry How does it work?

Harry starts to inspect the bit.

Quincy It works through a series of complexly designed 
differential gears.

Harry's face tightens, as he studies the bit further --

Harry This is my Patent.

Quincy "Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics," 
by Harry S.  Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent 
Office last year. 

Harry You stole it.

Quincy We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper.

Quincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button. The 
drill bit  presses down into a block of concrete and begins to 
rapidly CHEW through it, as  Harry marvels at the realisation of 
his design.

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 We built this arm to mine ice from the moon -- greatest  
discovery in space in thirty years.

Harry What'd this cost?

Golden Ten million.

Quincy Twenty-our million.

Harry Boy, I'm in the wrong line of work. So, that's where my 
taxes go. For  thievin' incompetent, government employed rip-off 
artists?

A.J. No torque adjustment, no pressure release valve....a big 
hunk of junk.

Quincy We're working on that.

Harry What happens if you hit gas? You have three seconds. Drill 
faster, run  like hell, or pray. 
(beat)
 Time's up. You're dead., The rig just blew. 

Golden Gentlemen, gentlemen, wait a second. The crux of the 
matter....

Harry Hang on. I betcha everyone in this room has a PH.D.

Golden Or three....

Harry I left school after tenth grade. I earned my PH.D every day 
offshore  drilling holes. You can't get it in a book. Drilling 
holes is about instinct -  about smellin' it. Drillin' holes is 
an art. You want the crux of the matter?
(beat)
 You stole my  patent, and you don't have a goddamn idea how to 
use it. As for this piece o'  crap, don't insult me. 
(walks around the rig)
 I'll rebuild it - the right way - and drill the  hole for you. 

Grace Uhm, pop, could we discuss this...?

Harry Just give me a space suit.

Golden You won't need one. You're not going up.

Harry You don't have a choice. I think all you PH.D's know that.

Harry walks off. Grace and A.J. follow.

Golden 
(calling after Harry)
 Harry. Let's figure this out.

INT. N.A.S.A. - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Harry sits opposite Golden and Temple. Grace and A.J. stand 
behind him.

Harry First of all, you're going to buy my patent.

Temple Of course, completely in order. What is the price?

Harry Fifty million dollars.

Uncomfortable pause. Temple clears his throat.

Temple Mr. Stamper, this mission is to preserve the future of....

Harry You're right, too low. I'm still pissed. Seventy million.

Temple Done.

Harry looks to Grace.

Harry Give that money to my Greenpeace buddies. 
(smile)
 Told  you...complicated.

Harry goes to shake, pulls back --

Harry 
(cont'd)
 And I never want to pay taxes again.

Temple I'll call the I.R.S., try to uhm, explain the situation.

They begin to shake. Harry withdraws his hand.

Harry I have this great log cabin in Montana. It's kind of a  
nature...getaway...thing.

Temple You want us to buy that, too?

Harry No. I fly fish there. But the fly fishin's sucked ever 
since they put in  that goddamn hydro-electric dam. I want it 
gone by the time I get back. 

Temple reluctantly nods. They stand to shake, Harry pulls away 
again.

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Now about my crew.

Golden The deal was for you, not others.

Harry I'm only as good as the men I work with. The ones in those 
home movies  of yours.

Golden It's out of the question.

Harry half-smiles to Grace.

Golden 
(cont'd)
 Okay, who?

Harry :My chief tool pusher. You game A.J.? A.J. Wouldn't miss 
it, Harry.

Harry And my roughnecks, Roustabouts, and Rockhound?

Temple Rock what? Is that a dog?

Harry No. Just a meek, geek geophysicist.

Golden What kind of men are these?

INT. SUPERSTRETCH LIMOUSINE - DAY

Bennie, Chick 
(30's, a street philosopher)
, Max 
(35, hulky)
, TITO, and ROCKHOUND  
(small, wiry)
 are riding in high style. Chick is hanging out of the sun roof  
with his shirt off. Radio's on full blast. Rockhound's pouring 
whiskey from the  fancy decanters. 

Chick We're living LARGE!

Bennie 
(talking on a cellular phone)
 Give me nickels on Miami, Washington, San  Diego, and Green Bay. 
(listens)
 Quit whining. Last thing I need is to be friends  with my 
bookie. 
(listens, then angry)
 
(MORE)
 

Bennie 
(cont'd)
 Look, when the entire Mexican Army had Butch and the Sundance  
Kid trapped in that Hacienda, did they wait to die? Hell no. They 
went out guns  blazing. I live  by the code of that movie, man. 

Bennie hangs up the phone, he looks across from him at -- Tito 
Guevara, late  30's, stocky, tattooed, Latino, 
(reformed 118th Street L.A. o.g. gangbanger who  was rescued from 
the streets ten years back and put to work on a rig by Harry)
  is reading a book "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus." 

Chick drops down into his seat, continues his heated discussion 
with Max.

Chick Charlie Bronson could kick Steve McQueen's ass and have 
enough left over  to duke it out with Burt Reynolds in his 
"Smokey and the Bandit" period. 

Max I'm glad you qualified that shit 'cause you know the Burt 
Reynolds of  "Deliverence" would have kicked Charlie's ass.  

Chick Burt was trouble in that flick.

Max What would you say the all-time, slam-bam, take-no-prisoners, 
kick-ass  Charlie Bronson movie is?

Chick All time? Well, let me think. "Dirty Dozen," the first 
"Death Wish." No,  no! That movie where he hunted the buffalo. I 
don't remember the name but he  hunted a buffalo and he said like 
three words during the whole picture. That's my  selection. 

Max Fine. The buffalo movie. That's your pick. You relly think 
that buffalo  Charlie could have thrown-down with the Steve 
McQueen form "Bullitt?" 

Chick He'da whooped his ass and then his father's. We'll settle 
this right  now. Rockhound? You heard the debate. You're the 
Supreme Court. What's the final  verdict? 

Rockhound Tough call. But for me though, one name -- Poncherello. 
Eric  Estrada. You know, "Chips."

Chick and Max just look at him. A beat. Then --

Max What did you ask him for? Guy makes his living looking at 
rocks.

The limo pulls over and stops. The DRIVER gets out and walks to 
the rear door.  Opens it.

EXT. N.A.S.A. - FRONT OF FACILITY - DAY

The Roughnecks get out in front of the JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. They 
stare up at  the familiar N.A.S.A. LOGO imprinted on the 
building. Chick and Bennie exchange  looks -- 

BEHIND THEM

A battered Ford pick-up pulls up, driven by 71 year-old "MAMA" 
MABEL BROWN.  Mabel's six foot-five, 375 pound son, BEAR, gets 
out of the car. 

Bear 'Bye, Mama.

Mabel Reginald, get over here and kiss your Mama goodbye.

Bear In front of the guys?

Mabel Never too old to kiss your Mama.

JIMBO, six-foot five, 375 pounds, bald, pulls up on a HARLEY 
DAVIDSON  motorcycle. He climbs off the bike.

Chick There ain't no oil in this place. What the hell are we 
doing here?

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MEDICAL WING - DAY

Harry has just briefed his crew on the mission.

Bear ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

Chick Harry, this is some "Star Wars" shit. This ain't for us.

Harry It's a job, like any other. Just a different location.

Max We work rigs. We understand rigs. We don't know dick about 
being  astronauts.

Rockhound 
(pointing)
 I might add that to get us up there they're going to have  to 
strap our asses on one of those rockets. That means fire, 
involuntary shit  release, and a slew of other stuff I can't hang 
with. 

JIMBO We don't have "The Right Stuff," know what I'm saying? 
(looking around)
  We're Roughnecks. 

Harry I'd rather die up there fighting this thing than sit  here 
waiting for it. 

Harry's line hangs in the air. Everyone exchanges looks.

Bear I don't like the idea of waiting around to croak. It's 
wimpy.

Chick If Harry-the-iron-ass is going, I'm going with him.

Bear Hell, I'm going just so I can say I went. 
(shrugs)
 Once we get up there,  it's making hole.

Tito I'm in.

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Max, Chick, and Tito sit in HOSPITAL SMOCKS on two examination 
tables. They have  tattoos, long hair. A cigarette dangles from 
Tito's lips. AIR FORCE NURSES are  everywhere. A NURSE clips a 
SWATCH OF HAIR from each of the men. She comes to  Tito. He grabs 
her arm. Takes the scissors from her. 

Tito Nobody touches my hair but me.

He cuts a SWATCH of hair, gives it to her. A SECOND NURSE is in 
front of Max and  Tito.

Max You're not taking any more blood. You vampires already have 
enough to feed  your coven for a year.

Nurse 
(nasally-voiced)
 We need to know what substances you've recently  ingested.

Tito What, uhh, "substances" you talkin' about?

Nurse 
(matter of fact)
 Drugs.

Ma and Tito eye each other nervously. Head Nurse, HELGA, stands 
before Chick  with an ENAMA PROBE and a JAR OF VASELINE. 

Chick An Ena-WHAT?

Helga Enema.

Chick And you want to stick it where?

Helga sticks the ENEMA PROBE in a jar of VASELINE.

Chick 
(cont'd)
 No way, lady. I came here to drill.

Helga So did I.

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING CENTER - DAY

Chick sits before a hugely endowed but square female N.A.S.A. 
CLINICAL  PSYCHOLOGIST.

Psychologist Say the first two words that come to mind, beginning 
with each  letter.

Chick Bodacious and....Bountiful. 
(she holds up "S")
 Succulent and Sinful.

She holds up the letter "F" and HOLD ON CHICK'S REACTION.

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Harry sits before the Chief Physician, DR. BANKS. Golden looks 
out the window.  Dr. Banks, dead-serious, flips through the 
medical and psychiatric test scores. 

Dr Banks Mr. Stamper, your men...are...take Mr. Chappel. I 
believe they call  him Chic.

Harry Charles, but if you call him that, he'll kill you.

Dr Banks 
(nervous laugh)
 I assume you're joking. 
(no response)
 Your men show  aggression, extreme maladjustment to their 
surroundings, anti-social behaviour  -- 

Harry With all due respect, Doctor, I don't know too army guys 
who are social  when someone is trying to jam a tube up their 
butt. 

Dr Banks Does your company have a drug testing program? These 
toxicology  reports are a throwback to the sixties. All show huge 
levels of nicotine and  alcohol. Three of the, four show illegal 
drugs. A couple I had to look up. One of them  had "Kematine" -- 
a very potent sedative. 

Harry A lot of people take sedatives.

Dr Banks This one is used on horses.

Harry I don't tell my men how to live their lives. They're with 
me to do a job  and they do it well.

Golden This is getting us nowhere. Can they fly, or not?

Dr Banks 
(flipping through physical records)
 Failed. Failed. Really failed.  Under the circumstances...
(locks eyes with Golden)
 They're the finest physical  specimens I've ever seen. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - LONGSHOT

Harry's crew walk together in newly issued N.A.S.A. jumpsuits. 
Bear and JIMBO  have ripped the sleeves and collars off their X-
Large suits. 

They walk past two N.A.S.A. mathematicians.

Mathematician 1 
(to mathematician 2)
 We're screwd.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Temple and Golden standing there with their arms crossed, 
watching the motley  crew of Roughnecks. They're joined by 
U.S.A.F. test pilots COLONEL SHARP, a  young Chuck Yeager type, 
and LT. COLONEL LUCAS TRUMAN, 30's, rigid and muscular. 



Sharp I mean, they kind of look like Armstarong, Lovell, and 
Glenn. 
(turns,  soberly to Golden)
 So, my wife and little girls' lives are in their hands, sir? 

Golden We need to drill. Do you know how to drill, colonel? 
(beat)
 Neither do  I. They're going up.

Temple 
(pointing to his lapel)
 With my stars came the power to be blunt. These  drillers are 
not trained for this, Dan.

Truman shakes his head. Sharp eyes Golden, waiting for a 
response.

Golden General, it's our job to get them ready to go into space. 
They're there  to do the drilling. 
(beat, then)
 And Colonel Sharp, we all have families. 

A hard look from Sharp to Temple, as Golden walks away.

Temple 
(to Golden)
 If they can't drill this hole, my men are going to take  over.

INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DAY

Quincy is face-to-face with Golden. TECHS work on the drilling 
arm in the b.g.  Harry and the Roughtnecks are across the room. 

Harry That Armadillo car. Get it in here.

In rolls the Armadillo, two TECHNICIANS pushing it. Harry and the 
guys look at  it. Quincy shows it off.

Quincy Pressurised titanium alloy cab. Airlocked life support. 
The chassis's  by General Motors. Heavy duty suspension and six 
wheel drive. 

Harry How were you going to power your drill arm?

Quincy Turbo-jet engine fuelled by Kerosene and liquid oxygen.

Harry I need to be able to start and stop. I need different 
speeds, and I need  reverse.

Quincy A jet engine can't do that.

Harry It can if it's hooked up to a clutch. A.J., get me a Mack 
truck  transmission.

Quincy That's so simple it's brilliant.

Harry I'm a simple man. But don't underestimate me.

A.J. Chick, Max! Mack truck tranny!

Chick and Max hurry off. A.J. smiles at Harry.

INT. JOHNSON CTR - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - WORKROOM - DAY

Harry, A.J., Bennie, Chick, Max, and Tito sit before Quincy, who 
demonstrates a  series of components on the N.A.S.A. SPACE SUIT. 

Quincy The new generation EMU - Extravehicular Mobility Unit - 
provides oxygen  for seven hours, a pressurised enclosure, and 
temperate control. The gloves and  helmet slide  on and lock with 
a twist, like this. The cap is worn underneath. It  contains a 
mike and headphones for two-way communication. We'll be able to 
see  you from a small  video cam mounted inside the helmet. The 
Undergarment has 300 feet  of plastic tubing circulating cooling 
water. Owen... 

OWEN THE TAILOR, five foot nothing & bald, stands in front of the 
men.

Owen These are made for men 5'8" to 6'2", between 140 and 200 
pounds. All of  you fit within those parameters - thank God we 
won't have to do any  re-tailoring.... 

Owen stops because --

Bear and Jimbo stand in the doorway --

JIMBO Yo. This where we get our suits?

Bear Sorry, we're late. Doc said we had... What do we got?

JIMBO Cholesterol difficulties. Said we gotta enter "The Zone."

Bear Shit, the only zone I know is the one around my mama's 
grill.

JIMBO 
(holding up form)
 But we're approved.

Owen looks at the human mountains standing before hi, and then at 
the tiny EMU  suit. Alterations will be necessary. 

INT. JOHNSON CENTER - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - MORNING

Clark briefs Harry and the mildly attentive Roughnecks. Sharp, 
Truman, CO-PILOTS  MEGAN WATTS 
(30's, tough as nails)
 and STAN WESTON stand in the back along with  N.A.S.A. Engineers 
JACK CROSS and RAYMOND SEARS. 

Clark United States astronauts train for eighteen months. You 
have nine days.  Officers Sharp, Truman, Watts and Weston are 
your military instructors and the  only pilots to have flown the 
spacecraft. 
(beat)
 Each is a combat decorated officer  and among the finest men and 
women we have in the service. Pay attention to  them. 

Sharp We spend six months on emergency training - we're throwing 
that out. If  we fail, everyone dies. Game over. That's a heavy 
load but it's ours to carry.  The purpose of this is to train you 
in the physical and mental rigors of working  in a weightless 
enviroment so that you will not panic. So you can do your jobs.  
(beat)
 You will vomit.  Your eyes will be sucked into the back of your 
heads. You'll be so  tired you can't eat but that won't matter 
'cause you'll be so sore you can't  take a dump. By the  
way...good morning. 

INT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - DAY

Splash, Splash. Harry and the Roughnecks descend underwater. They 
look like  Michelin Men in their thick space suits. Navy divers 
are around them as they are  lined up. 

Through the underwater speaker, WE HEAR a trainer giving them 
instructions for  their weightless aerobic training. WE HEAR a 
loud, embarrassing gastric sound  from Bear's suit. 

Bear Houton, we have a problem. That is some vicious methane.

Harry gives a "shut the fuck up" look. Time passes as the guys 
are dying,  HUFFING and PUFFING. One by one, they reach 
exhaustion. A cabled harness hoists  each out.

INT. JOHNSON CENTER - CARDIO LAB - DAY

Harry and his team, in T-shirts and running shorts, jog on a 
series of  threadmills, wired to EKG machines, nostrils taped 
shut, breathing tubes locked  in their mouths. EXT. N.A.S.A. T-38 
JET HANGER - DAY

A gleaming spit-shine hanger full of fifteen N.A.S.A. T-38 
fighter jets. Our  drill team walks up looking worn out. They are 
met at the open hanger door by  pilots CHUCK JR., Vietnam vet, 
leatherneck-take-no-pussy-bullshit-type-of-guy  and HAMMER. 

Chuck Jr. On this mission, they tell me you will experience the 
worst G-Forces  in the history of flight. It's like an elephant 
sitting on your chest. So, I  intend to flip you, spin you, splat 
your bodies till your bones hurt. Now load up and  enjoy the 
flight. 

The Roughnecks, wearing flight suits and helmets, board the 
planes. Harry does  not like the look of these things. Bear is 
trying to figure out how to fit  inside. 

Bear Thing's made for a child - like my kid's car seat.

Chuck Jr. and Hammer walk up to a nervous Harry.

Chuck Jr. What's the problem, Texas tough guy?

Harry I've got a thing about flying.

Chuck Jr. Not good for an astronaut. 
(looks to Hammer)
 Hammer, go easy, don't  rip his guts out.

Hammer Sure thing, Chuck.

INT. JET FIGHTER.

Harry plastered to the seat, MOANING so scared he can't puke. The 
plane  barrel-rolls and dives straight to the ground. Harry is 
GRUNTING and sweating  trying to stay conscious. 

EXT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY

The T-38's are pulling up and letting the drill crew out. They 
walk back with  white sweat, soaked faces and wobbly legs. Harry 
exits the plane. 

Harry I hate to fly. I hate to fly. I hate it so much.

Harry leans over to puke.

INT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY

The Roughnecks walking to the T-38 Hanger. Sharp stands on the 
stairway to the  707 and calls everyone to attention.

Sharp Trainees, AT EASE 
(in command)
 We are not done here. We're taking you  for a little ride. This 
bird will climb to 40 thousand feet and drop to 10  thousand feet 
to give  you the feeling of weightlessness for 30 seconds. 
Welcome to  N.A.S.A.'s Vomit Comet. INT. VOMIT COMET

The plane drops. The Roughnecks lift off inside. Everyone's 
flying around the  cabin. It's a disaster. Guys bump heads. Bear 
floats like a beached whale. Jimbo  rams the roof. Hary hold a 
barf bag as he floats. An alarm SOUNDS, then the  plane levels 
off, the guys go slamming into the floor. 

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER BATHROOM

Tracking past a row of stalls, WE SEE the soles of a pair of 
shoes peeking out.  Then another pair, another, and another over 
the multiple sounds of guts being  tossed into the toilet. 

Golden, Clark, and Sharp stand outside the stalls.

Golden This is like putting the Hell's Angels in space.

INT. N.A.S.A. RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

Harry and the Roughnecks are welding the Armadillo, working tough 
and hard.

INT. N.A.S.A. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

The Roughnecks are getting dressed.

Max 
(to Chick)
 We're going to go pound some brews where they have a lot of  
sweaty, naked women. You in?

Chick 
(shakes head)
 No. I got to take care of something.

The Roughnecks walk out, leaving Chick behind.

INT N.A.S.A. CAR - NIGHT

Driven by a uniformed N.A.S.A. TECH, Chick pulls up to a house in 
a residential  neighbourhood. He sits there with a beat, unsure 
of what to do. 

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Chick walks up to the house, KNOCKS. DENISE WILLIAMS answers the 
door.

Chick Hey, Denise.

Denise What do you want, Chick?

A big six-year old boy, TOMMY, runs up behind his mom.

Tommy Who is it, Mommy?

Chick looks at Tommy, smiles.

Denise It's um...just a salesman, honey.

Chick Hi.

Tommy 
(looking straight up)
 You look like big foot.

Chick kneels, extends his hand. Tommy smiles and shakes it. Chick 
doesn't want  to let go.

Chick I got a feeling you're going to be pretty big yourself. 
Denise Go  inside and play, Tommy.

Tommy Okay, mommy. 'Bye, Big Foot.

Chick 'Bye, Tommy.

Chick watches Tommy run off. He looks to Denise.

Denise What was I supposed to tell him? We've got a life here 
now, Chick, with  someone we can depend on.

Chick What I did before was wrong. Every day of my life I regret 
it. I can see  you've got a good thing going, Denise, I'm not 
trying to mess that up. But this  thing's come my  way and I got 
the chance to do something really right. 

Denise This another one of your scams, Chick?

Chick It's no scam. You might just be proud of me.

Denise opens the door a little wider, SHE SEES the car in the 
driveway. The  N.A.S.A. logo stencilled on the door. The N.A.S.A. 
Tech waiting. 

Denise What's going on, Chick?

Chick I can't tell you now. But if it comes out good, I'll be 
back. 
(beat)
  Then maybe you'd consider telling Tommy I'm not a...salesman. 
It's good to see  you. You look really  beautiful. 

Chick turns and walks away.

Denise Hey, Chick. 
(Chick turns)
 You be careful.

INT. LUCKY LAURIE'S - NIGHT

A seedy Houston drinking hole. All the Roughnecks sit at the bar. 
The bar is  littered with EMPTY MUGS AND SHOTGLASSES. A WOMAN 
looks at Bennie. 

Woman What are you boys doin' down here in good 'ol Houston?

Bennie 
(burps)
 We're in astronaut training.

This gets the reaction you'd expect.

INT. JOHNSON CENTER - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - LATE NIGHT

Harry and Quincy go over a list of stuff to order and logistical 
problems.  N.A.S.A. Tech rushes into the room.

N.A.S.A. Tech Space Command spotted more incoming.

Quincy 
(springing up)
 Where' it headed? How big?

N.A.S.A. Tech Don't know.

They start to run out of the room. Harry follows.

INT. ROCKET ENGINE DEVELOPMENT ROOM

The camera follows up a long ladder to a huge rocket bell housing 
where A.J. and  Grace are kissing passionately. They notice Harry 
and Quincy, and the other  Techs heading for Mission Control. 
Harry locks eyes with A.J. He doesn't like  it. A.J. and Grace 
know something is up. They follow Harry and the others into  
Mission Control. 

INT. MISSION CONTROL - LATE NIGHT

The room is lit up. Men are scrambling. Phones and satellite 
charts pop up.  Tracking devices PING. Golden on top of the 
chaos. A TRACKING TECH plots on a  map. Clark stands over a 
N.A.S.A. TECH reading a computer screen. 

Golden Projected impact tracking. I need stats!

Tracking Tech Eastern Asian Hemisphere... someplace...ETA 17 
minutes.

N.A.S.A. Tech We have confirmation. The incoming is about the 
size of the  Astrodome.

Clark We've got to warn.

Golden Warn who? The whole South Pacific?

Golden, with lack of sleep and stress, falls back into a chair. 
He closes his  eyes, opens them -- finding Harry in the upper 
Mission Control Deck. They lock  eyes for a long moment. 

INT. SHANGHAI - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

The city ablaze in neon. The harbour, floating junksmanned by 
Chinese merchants.  A loud sonic boom CRACKS in the sky. There's 
a BRIGHT FLASH in the sky. Night  becomes day for two seconds. 

The world slows down, motion creeps. The bright FLASH catches the 
face of a  little BOY reaching out for his father's hand. The 
asteroid SHRIEKS down,  hitting the harbour's surface in a red 
hot FLASH-BOILED at 100 thousand degrees. 

INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT

The room is silent. Reports are starting to come in about the 
devastation.  Golden walks up to Harry who is standing with Grace 
and A.J. He pulls Harry  aside. 

Golden Stamper, answer me one question - have you ever let anyone 
down?

We go close on Harry's face. Searing flashbulbs popping, WIDEN TO

INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROO - NIGHT

WE SEE him from behind as he addresses the massive crowd. The 
U.S. PRESIDENT  stands before a throng of reporters.

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS

Papers headlines, CNN reporters flash on screens. Images of 
people watching the  news in bars, at home. A NEW YORK POST slams 
down on the pavement, the headline -  SHANGHAI DISASTER, MASSIVE 
DEATH TOLL RISING.

INT. SOMEPLACE IN KENTUCKY - HOLDING CELL - DAWN

Jimbo is talking to an F.B.I. AGENT who is on the other side of 
the bars holding  a newspaper.

Jimbo If it's over then why aren't you lettin' us out of this 
goddamn cell?

F.B.I. Agent Be real soon, son.

The agent flips the newspaper into the holding cell and walks 
away.

Jimbo Don't walk away, I want to talk to my lawyer. You hear me?

Pearl 
(refering to the newspaper)
 This says that the asteroid came from the  Southern Hemisphere.

Theo Southern Hemisphere?

Pearl No kidding. It's a big sky - they want people to look the 
other way.

INT. MANHATTEN - TAXI CAB

Stu the cabbie is riding with a WALL STREET GUY.

Stu Kennedy lied about the Bay of Pigs, Nixon...Watergate, say no 
more.  Clinton. One word. 'Women.' If I know one thing; ALL 
PRESIDENTS LIE. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - TRAINING ROOM - MORNING

Morning after the devastating disaster in Shanghai. Harry walks 
into the quiet  room. Harry's all business. 

Harry Forty thousand people died last night. But I guess that 
didn't concern  any of you. I hope you all had a good time last 
night. 

The Roughnecks look around. They know there were wrong.

Chick I gotta tell you...I'm scared.

Harry Well, you should be scared. We all should be. 'Cause if we 
fail, they  say the Earth will die.

Harry sits down, looks out the window at N.A.S.A. Techs working 
in the room down  below.

Harry You think these N.A.S.A. guys are a bunch of clean-cut 
pussies, that's  it. They can out think you, they can outrun you. 
This job, gentlemen, is as real  as it gets. I need every one of 
you. 
(he looks them in the eye)
 If you're not up to it,  then walkout of that door. 

Finally. Theo and Pearl, frustrated, go to the TWO-WAY MIRROR, 
blocking Jimbo  from view.

Theo I'm hungry! When're we gonna eat?

Pearl I have p.m.s.!! I need some ibuprofen!

Jimbo grabs Randy's legal pad and writes:

HELP!! BIG ASTEROID GOING TO HIT EARTH. COORDINATES 712 BY 345.

Randy stares at the message.

Randy Okay, I'm done here!

The door opens. Two F.B.I. AGENTS lead Randy out. Jimbo looks at 
Theo and Pearl.

Jimbo He flunked the bar three times.

INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

-- Harry shows Quincy his DRAWINGS of the DRILLING ARM - the way 
Harry wants it.

-- Harry, A.J. and Quincy work with the TURBO PROP ENGINE, 
transforming it into  a JET FUEL GENERATOR.

Quincy We'll run your liquid oxygen from the shuttle through a 
tube into the  intake manifold. No problem.

A.J. I figured out how to bring up the slag. Direct the jet 
turbine's exhaust  down the drill pipe. It'll blow the stuff 
right up the hole. 

Harry Good, A.J. Good.

-- Chick, Bennie, Bear, Jumbo welding new pieces of the DRILLING 
ARM together.  The Roughnecks have changed. Chick and Bennie now 
have crew-cuts. 

-- A.J., Harry, Max and Tito build the drilling arm.

EXT. ARIZONA - SHUTTLE TAKE OFF AREA

TWO X-71 SHUTTLES in the hanger. TECHNICIANS scramble around, 
preparing the  shuttles for the mission.

Harry 
(points)
 From all of your intel, the deepest fault line is here. This is  
my sweet spot. If I can get a clean hole in there, She'll blow in 
half.... 

Golden ....and the two pieces will slide right past us. You 
cannot shatter it.  Getting hit with 20 smaller asteroids is as 
bad as one big one. You have to  drill, plant the nuke,  lift 
off, and detonate -- all before the asteroid reaches this  
position. 
(demonstrates position)
 You have eight hours. Remember it. You must  detonate by this 
point or,  the two halves will hit us. 

Harry nods and walks off.

Sharp Drill an eight-hundred foot hole in eight hours? Is that 
possible?

Harry doesn't like to be questioned --

Harry You just worry about getting me on that rock, Colonel. Let 
me worry  about the drilling.

A moment of conflict between them.

EXT. JOHNSON CENTE - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - DAY

ONE OF THE ARMADILLOS, complete with drilling arm, sits at the 
bottom of the  tank. Harry and six Roughnecks are already at the 
bottom, in pressure suits and  helmets. 

Golden, Quincy, Clark, Sharp, Truman, and all of the N.A.S.A. 
BRASS, observe.

A.J. is the last to enter the tank.

INT. N.A.S.A. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - UNDERWATER

A.J. descend to the tank's bottom. Harry, Chick, Bennie, Max and 
Tito are in  bulky white pressure suits. Jimbo and Bear wear the 
largest pressure suits ever  made. They talk through their helmet 
radio links. 

One drilling arm starts turning. The Roughnecks turn toward a 
STACK OF 20 FOOT  LONG STAINLESS STEEL DRILLING PIPES on the 
tank's bottom. ABOVE WATER - SIDE OF  TRAINING TANK

Golden hits a stopwatch.

Golden 
(into intercom)
 Go.

INT. N.A.S.A. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - UNDERWATER

Bear and Jimbo grab a pipe string and handle onto the mock-up 
drill arm. They  clamp it on. Bennie and Chick screw a drill bit 
onto the pipe string. They are  good, very good. The work with 
the manic intensity of a pit crew at Indy. 

Harry Done!

ABOVE WATER - SIDE OF TANK

Golden hits his stopwatch. Smiles. The N.A.S.A. Brass is 
impressed.

Golden These guys are fast. Harry, interior gauge check.

INT. N.A.S.A. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - UNDERWATER

Harry We're on A.J.

A.J. Let's see what this baby can do.

Harry and A.J. move the Armadillo's AIRLOCK DOOR. It has an 
exterior open/close  button. Harry punches it. The side door 
opens. Harry enters, then A.J. 

INT. ARMADILLO - UNDERWATER

Harry and A.J., still underwater, climb inside. Harry presses the 
PRESSURIZATION  button. Simulating pressurisation in space, the 
water in the cab is blown out,  and air WHOOSHES IN. 

Harry and A.J. sit dripping in the watertight cab. Through the 
front window WE  SEE the other Roughnecks in the tank. Harry 
unlocks his neck seals. Pulls off  his helmet. 

Harry Lose the helmet, A.J.

A.J. snaps out of it. His hands go instinctively to the helmet 
and in one  motion...CLICK. It's off.

Harry 
(clicks radio)
 We're in. Run the simulation.

The interior PRESSURE GUGE NEEDLES and MONITORS 
(engine torque, drill direction,  etc.)
 start bobbing. The drill starts to cut into a BLOCK OF CONCRETE. 

Golden 
(V.O)
 How's she look?

Harry Torque adjuster's good. Fuel level good. A.J., downhole 
pressure?

A.J. We can do better. I'm increasing the RPM's to seven 
thousand. We can get  more torque.

Golden 
(V.O)
 Negative, A.J. Don't exceed ix thousand. Not on this run.

A.J. Relax. I built this thing. She's got more in her. Increasing 
the RPM's.

Golden 
(V.O)
 Negative, A.J. A.J. increases the RPM's. The gauge starts to 
rise. The N.A.S.A. Brass shifts  uneasily in their seats. They're 
not accoutomed to seeing their astronauts  disobey orders. 

Golden 
(V.0)
 
(cont'd)
 A.J., shut the Armadillo down now

A.J. We can push it, further. Let's see what she can do.

Suddenly, the RPM''s shoot into the red. A red siren spins in the 
control room.  The Armadillo SHAKES violently. The DRILLING BIT 
grinds to nothing. The  Armadillo BLOWS a tranny. 

Harry's eyes close. He's pissed.

IN THE CONTROL ROOM

The N.A.S.A. Brass looks to Golden. One of them shakes their 
head. Sharp and  Golden exchange a look. Sharp shakes his head. 
INSIDE THE TANK

A.J. presses a button and the cabin, simulating 
"depressurisation" in space,  begins to fill with water.

INT. NEUTRL BUOYANCY TANK - SIDE OF TANK - DAY

Everyone around him just watches, as A.J. climbs out of the tank. 
After a  minute, A.J. looks up, sees all the eyes in the room on 
him. 

EXT. CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

Harry is outside, smoking a Coheba. Harry runs his hand over a 
SMALL METAL MEDAL  that hangs from his neck. Golden approaches. 

Golden A.J.'s off the team. We need a list of names from you to 
fill the slot.

Harry A.J. would be the first name on my list.

Golden We don't want independent thinkers. And we don't need 
heroes. We need a  team.

Harry You have to have confidence in the men you send up. I 
understand that.  But I'm the one that has to land on that rock. 
Not you. 
(firm)
 I pick my own  team. 

Golden One shot. Pull him in line or send him home.

INT . HUB OF ROCKET SIMULATOR - NIGHT

A.J. and Grace are there talking. Grace is on A.J.'s lap.

A.J. I pushed it, I screwed up.

Grace These astronauts train for years for what you're training 
for in a few  days.

A.J. I don't know why I didn't just listen to them.

Grace So, tomorrow you listen.

A.J. and Grace share a look.

A.J. I love you, Grace.

A N.A.S.A. Tech approaches.

N.A.S.A. Technician Harry wants to see you.

INT. DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE ROOM - NIGHT

Harry and A.J. stand in the centre of a high-tech supply room. 
SPARE PARTS from  shuttles, PROTOTYPES and WORK TOOLS are 
everywhere. 

Harry You tell me what the hell you think you're doing?

A.J. I'm trying to work with the team.

Harry Bullshit. You're trying to lead this team. You're trying to 
be me.  You're not me.

A.J. What do you want? You want me to quit?

Harry If you can't bury this cowboy shit, yeah, I want you to 
quit.

A.J. I don't have to prove anything to anybody, Harry.

Harry I listen to N.A.S.A., you listen to me. That's the chain. 
Either you  follow it, or you're done.

A.J. I'll follow it.

Harry I stood up for you, because I've made a life of proving 
people wrong.

Harry's hand slides down to the medal hanging from his neck.

Harry 
(cont'd)
 When I was about your age, I was in Galveston, Texas. I scraped  
together some money, bought some old equipment, a little land. I 
set up a rig  and drilled my first hole. Then I sat there and 
watched her soak up the sun for six  months - waiting for this 
baby to pop. Everybody told me to quit. I wouldn't  listen. My 
wife ran off with a drill-rigger, left me with Grace. Everybody 
in town thought I  was a fool. But I stayed with it. And in the 
last hour of the last day, she  popped. She spit out that black 
gold and I danced in it like a wild Indian. 
(reflective )
 I  captured the magic 
(holding medal)
 This is the last piece of pipe that struck  gold that day. 

Harry takes off the medal. Sets it on the table. He grabs a 
cutting vice and  cuts the medal in two perfect halves. He hands 
one half to A.J. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Here, take it up there.

QUICK MONTAGE

Inside the neutral buoyancy tank -- Harry's crew goes through all 
DRILLS one  final time 
(final mission checks)
 in quick succession. Everything runs  perfectly. The Armadillo 
is rebuilt and shown functioning without error. A.J.  works as 
part of the team. 

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

The hour of the mission. The two teams sit in the orange N.A.S.A. 
flight  pressure suits. Golden enters and stands before the room. 

Golden In the book of Revalations, the Bible speaks of a final 
day on Earth,  when all mankind shall perish, shall cease to 
exist. This day is known as  Armageddon. 
(firm)
 Right  now, that day conflicts with six billion schedules. 
(beat)
 For the  first time in the history of this planet, s species 
possesses the technology to  prevent it's own  extinction. 
(beat)
 I've been with N.A.S.A. my entire adult life.  Eleven years as 
an astronaut, another fifteen on the ground at Mission Control.  
Twenty-six years I've had  to answer one question -- why? Why 
more money? Why the race for  space? Why do we need to know what 
is up there? 
(beat)
 When we come through  this, I'll take  comfort in the fact that 
I won't ever have to answer those  questions again. You are our 
warriors up there. You are our last hope. God be  with you. 

The crew stands......

EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - RUNWAY - DAY

Two sleek BLACK LEAR JETS are parked on the runway. Harry studies 
them. Grace  approaches.

Harry You know I was thinking, Gracie. Over the years, I should 
have patted  you on the back more....

Grace Dad, you don't need --

Harry No father has ever been prouder of his child, Gracie. I 
want you to know  that.

Grace's reaction makes it clear that Harry has never said 
anything like this  before.

Grace I love you, Dad.

Harry I love you too, Gracie.

Grace 
(as they hug)
 Keep an eye on A.J. for me.

Harry climbs up the metal stairs --

A.J. and the rest of Harry's crew comes out of the building. A.J. 
moves to Grace  as she watches her father disappear into the jet. 

A.J. Excuse me. 
(Grace turns)
 You're really insanely gorgeous and I was jost  sort of 
wondering if you -- 

Grace I'm engaged. But my father hasn't given him his blessing so 
you might  still have a chance. 
(smiles, then serious)
 Promise me you won't do anything  stupid up there.

A.J. nods. They kiss passionately. Harry's crew sees this and 
applauds. Grace  blushes, embarrassed.

A.J. I love you, Grace.

Grace I love you. Come back, Okay?

Harry's crew boards LEAR JET 2. A.J. starts toward LEAR JET 1. 
Grace watches him  walk away, eyeing his suit.

Grace A.J.--

A.J. 
(turning)
 Yeah?

Grace When you get back, ask them if you can kep the suit 
(winks)
 It's kind of  sexy.

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - BY SHUTTLE FREEDOM

The cone-shaped noses of the two X-71's are towering silhouettes 
against the  sun. Massive CRAWLERS move the shuttles to the 
launch tower. 

EXT. SHUTTLES FREEDOM & INDEPENDENCE LAUNCH - DAY

Seen from a distance as silhouettes behind a sun-soaked sky, 
sixteen figures  walk toward us. As they grow closer, WE SEE the 
intense game faces of Harry,  A.J., Bennie, Chick, Jumbo, Tito, 
Rockhound, Max and others approaching the  launch site. They look 
like N.A.S.A.'s version of the "Dirty Dozen." 

Harry carries a LARGE MYSTERIOUS METAL CASE, that we've not seen 
before now.

INT. LAUNCH TOWER ELEVATOR - LATER

Harry exits the elevator and start to walk to the CATWAL to the 
Freedom shuttle.  Harry carries his suitcase.

N.A.S.A. Tech 1 Sir, was that case authorised for transport?

N.A.S.A. Tech 2 Our weight to fuel ratio's calibrated to the 
kilogram, sir.  How much does that weigh?

Harry Sixty pounds.

N.A.S.A. Tech 1 That can't go up with you, sir.

Harry Wait here.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AFTERNOON

Harry enters the cabin. N.A.S.A.'s crack seven-member "Strap-in-
Team" goes to  work. Harry's crew are outfitted with their 
HELMETS and CHUTE PACKS. Each step  is methodical, each piece of 
equipment is checked and rechecked. 

Harry Hey you. Yeah you. Come here.

A YOUNG N.A.S.A. TECH approaches. Harry gestures at a row of 
METAL COMPONENTS  housed in the wall.

Harry What's all this crap?

N.A.S.A. Technician 
(pointing to various)
 Multi-track C.D. player.  Anti-gravity hand washer, utensil 
washer, and micro-wave oven. 
(proud)
 We worked  hard to make the X-71 feel  more like home. 

Harry just looks at the kid.

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - BY SHUTTLE FREEDOM - DAY

Metal components one after the other come out of the shuttle 
hatchway and SLAM  into a heap on the lake bed. Harry then 
appears in the hatchway. 

Harry We don't need music and we don't mind dirty utensils.

Harry picks up his LARGE METAL CASE and ducks back inside the 
Freedom. The  N.A.S.A Techs stare at the ruined components at 
their feet.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM

Sharp addresses the crews of both shuttles over the radio --

Sharp Listen up -- the MIR will be spinning to give us gravity so 
we can work  faster. You might feel queasy or dizzy. We'll dock, 
transfer the fuel, then  detach from the MIR.  Fast and safe. 
This stuff is very volatile. 

INT. RUSSIAN MIR SPACE STATION - DOCKING PORT

Lev is working feverishly, running highly insulated liquid oxygen 
and hydrogen  PROPELLANT TRANSFER HOSES from the MIR's several 
LABORATORY and LIVING MODULES  to the MIR's twin docking ports. 

A BLUE INDICATOR LIGHT FLASHES. Lev looks out of the MIR's 
portside window. His  eyes light up. He smiles.

EXT. SPACE - LOW EARTH ORBIT - MIR DOCKING PORTS

Freedom and Independence approach the MIR station. The MIR is T-

INT. CENTRAL ROOM - CENTER HUB OF MIR

Harry, Bennie, and Lev are talking in the combination kitchen/ 
rec room of the  MIR -- a little bigger than a walk-in closet. 
Lev grabs a VIDEO CAMERA and  starts video-taping Harry and 
Bennie. 

Lev I hear rumour on radio. My country broke. No steaks in 
freezer. They plan  to sell me and the MIR

 Can you confirm this? 

Bennie We wouldn't know. What's the camera?

Lev Oh, I also di-rec-tor. Russian cinema. MIR movies. Each has 
title.

Lev grabs remote control. On a large TELEVISION screen VARIOUS 
IMAGES OF LEV  appear.

Lev "Lev loves cargo." "Lev sleeps." "Lev prepares for 
Americans." "Lev gets  bored so he gets drunk." Funny but...too 
long. 

Bennie Looks like you have a lot of free time on your hands.

Lev Yeah. I alone by myself.

Watts comes into the room. The first woman Lev has seen in a 
very, very long  time. Lev moves the camera all over her. 

Lev Hello, fellow space colleague.

Watts nods.

Watts I'll be in the docking port.

trailing  fragments motionless in relation to each other, 
travelling as a swarm, a cluster  of debris. As it nears the 
Moon's gravitational field -- 

TRAILING FRAGMENTS peel away, drawn into the Moon by its lunar

THE ASTEROID'S TRAILING DEBRIS appears, a HUGE CLOUD of tiny ICE 
CHUNKS AND  PEBBLES, and much larger BOULDERS, and ICEBERGS the 
size of houses, the ice  glinting with reflected sunlight, 
throwing off a dazzling SPECTRAL SHOWER OF  LIGHT in all 
directions, and finally -- 

THE ASTEROID'S HUGE CORE - it has just cleared the Moon and now 
flies straight  for it's destination - the cool, blue PLANET 
EARTH dead ahead across an expanse  of space.

Shuttles. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM COCKPIT 

In one terrifying second, visibility is cut to twenty feet. Then 
BANG! BANG!  BANG! BANG! 

PEBBLES and SMALL ICE CHUNKS strike the windshield, chipping and 
denting it. The  impacts are violent; the interior is buffeted 
around. It's the space equivalent  of bad hailstorm.

Truman I've got no visibility. I've lost orientation to the 
target! 

Suddenly, as sudden as it came, the debris clears. 

But a HUGE ICE BOULDER the size of a three-story building twirls 
into  Independence's path. It hits a BOULDER which collides with 
another. 

Truman Big guy! Dead ahead! 

Truman stabs his directional thruster button. Shuttle 
Independence veers to the  right.... 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Sharp hits his directional thruster, and Freedom veers to the 
left.... 

EXT. THROUGH THE ASTEROID'S TAIL 

Freedom goes left, Independence right, splitting the ice boulder. 

Freedom clears the ice boulder by a foot. Independence, not so 
lucky, clips the  ice boulder, ripping her left thruster clean 
off. With one thruster,  Independence careens out of control, 
twirling and spinning. 

INT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE 

Truman

Independence. 

Sharp and Watts watch Independence twirling toward the asteroid.

The INDEPENDENCE'S ERRANT ARMADILLO strikes the Freedom's nose, 
spider-webbing  the WINDSHIELD. Sharp and Watts recoil in terror. 
Watts SCREAMS.

The fuselage is spinning. A.J., Bennie and the others are in 
terror. In the  cockpit, Truman SCREAMS over the radio

Truman Houston, MAYDAY, MAYDAY, we're going down! 

The Shuttle's roof collides with a rock. We hear SCRAPING METAL. 
The CEILING  dents in, dislodging INTERIOR CEILING PANELS filled 
with wires and electrical  components; they rain down on A.J. and 
the others. 

Choas. The SPARKING CABIN fills with smoke. 

Truman Crew, go to life support! 

Everyone grabs for their HELMET, frantically trying to get them 
on. A.J. gets  his on, but he can't lock his neck seal. He 
fidgets with the little SEAKL LOCKS. 

A.J. rips off the helmet. It slips from his fingers and floats 
off through the  zero-g cabin!

Golden looks at Grace. She looks back. A tear slides off her 
cheek to the  console. Harry's daughter doesn't say a word, or 
break down. She just quietly  rises and walks to the back of the 
room. Grace rubs her bare ring finger. A  BEAT. 

CAMERA SPIES the ZERO BARRIER CLOCK. Seven hours, 52 minutes, 000 
feet drilled.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM

Chick, Bear, and Max prepare to disembark, donning helmet and 
glove assemblies,  clicking neck and wrist seals into locking 
position. 

Harry comes into the cockpit. Watts is flipping switches and 
reading gauges.  Sharp's on the radio. A haze fills the cockpit. 

Watts Engine ignition system isn't responding.

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL

INTERCUT - FREEDOM/ MISSION CONTROL

Golden What's the problem?

Flip Engine ignition. Starting diagnostics.

Sharp Houston, I don't know where we are. Tell me how far we 
overshot Harry's  sweep spot. Advise on currant location, over. 

Skip motions to Golden and Clark. They hurry over to his console. 
On Skip's  computer screen is a MAP OF THE ASTEROID containing 
its geological fault lines. 

Skip They overshot their landing 26 miles. There's a different 
fault line, but  it's deeper.

Golden How much deeper? 

Skip Two hundred feet. 

Golden exchanges a look with Temple. 

Golden Harry, your fault line's fifty yards off the starboard 
side. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Harry stalks to the rear. 

Harry Rockhound. 

Rockhound Yes, sir. 

Harry I'm gonna get you some surface samples and you're gonna 
tell me what I'm  up against. 

Rockhound Rocks are my life. 

Watts Willie, we might be stuck. 

Sharp exchanges grim looks with Pitts and Fisk over this bad 
information. 

Harry The good news just keeps comin'. Load up, guys. 

Sharp watches Harry and the guys exit to the rear. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Freedom's cargo door opens; its RAMP unfolds to the asteroid's 
surface. HARRY  looks out. 

Freedom is in a small, cold, dark valley. The asteroid's face is 
tilted away  from the Earth and Sun. THE MOON is huge on our rear 
horizon. The place is  eerily calm and tranquil. Harry walks down 
the ramp onto the asteroid surface. 

INT. FREEDOM CARGO BAY - INSIDE ARMADILLO 

Chick, at the Armadillo's controls, engages gears. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The Armadillo rumbles out of the cargo bay, carrying Bear, Max, 
Rockhound and  Pitts over the wheel wells. 

The Armadillo drives 50 yards from Freedom and parks. The guys 
hop down, turning  on their PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS. Bear begins 
off-loading 20-foot long DRILLING  PIPES. 

Harry takes readings from a SEISMIC INSTRUMENT. Pulls out a SOIL 
SAMPLER, a  small shovel on a telescoping shaft. He digs it in 
with his boot. Clang. It  doesn't dig in at all. He walks around, 
stabbing it into the ground. CLANG.  CLANG. 

Chick exchanges nervous looks with Bear and Max. 

Harry Bedrock. Whole goddamn place is Bedrock. 

Harry examines the ground. Not satisfied. He finds a spot he 
likes; digs an "X"  in the soil with his boot. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Here. Fire up the Bad Boy bit. 

Chick, Max and Bear go into action. Max screws the Bad Boy bit 
onto the first  drilling pipe. Bear hoists the pipe up to the 
DRILLING MECHANISM, muscles it  onto the DRILL DRIVE, then clamps 
it on. 

Harry plugs a TEE and GOLF BALL into the craggy surface. He 
waggles his club, a  5-IRON HEAD, screwed onto the soil sampler's 
shaft. 

Pitts What's he doing? 

Chick Wildcatters are superstitious, Colonel. Harry does this 
every time we  break ground. 

He swings....WHACK! The ball rockets off the tee and keeps 
going...and going... 

Harry HOLE NUMBER 77. Let 'er rip! 

Chick throws a lever, lowering the BAD BOY BIT into the rocky, 
icy surface. Down  the drill pipe goes, unimpeded, 10 feet just 
like that. It suddenly stops. It's  turning, but not drilling. 
Bear and Max approach the drill hole. 

Bear What in hell's down there?

Harry Chick, bring 'er up!

Chick throws it in reverse. The DRILLING ARM reverses out of the 
hole. The Bad  Boy bot comes up CHEWED TO SHREDS. Harry and the 
guys examine the drill bit.  Everyone exchanges a worried look. 

Max The dream. It's my dream. 

Harry Shut up, Max. 
(looks at Bear)
 What's with the look? Get that off your  face. You've seen bits 
get eaten before. 

Bear Not after ten feet. 

Chick The first ten better be the worst ten. 

Harry Go to the Terminator. 

Chick grabs Harry's mysterious METAL CASE. Harry pops open the 
metal case,  revealing THE TERMINATOR, a super high-tech bit. 

Harry I designed you. I built you. You are the enemy of all 
subterranean shit.  You are the king. It's showtime. 

Harry passes it to Bear, who screws it onto the drilling pipe, 
Rockhound scoops  up a COLLECTION OF DOWNHOLE ROCK CHIPS. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Hit it, Chick. 

The DRILL PIPE turns. Sediment comes WHOOSHING out of the hole 
and -- THE DRILL  PIPE descends like a bitch. 

INT. FREEDOM 

Sharp, Watts, Pitts and Fisk have a PANEL removed, exposing the 
guts of  Freedom's wiring and components. Watts and Sharp are 
inside the panel, scrunched  against the fuselage wall, unbolting 
a large COMPONENT. Watts hands Pitts and  Fisk a SMALLER 
COMPONENT. 

Watts Unbolt the housing. There and there. 

INT. ARMADILLO 

The rock CHIPS spew into the COLLECTOR in front of ROCKHOUND. 
Harry looks on. 

Harry What do you make of that? 

Rockhound picks up several chips. Draws them close to his eyes. 

Rockhound Oh my. Oh my, my, my. This isn't rock. It's uhh, it's 
uhh,  it's......iron. 

Harry Iron deposit? 

Rockhound 
(shakes head)
 No. It's been melted. Forged rather. I've only seen  this once - 
at a volcano in Hawaii. 
(looks up at Harry)
 You're drilling into a  big slab of cast-iron, Mr. Stamper. 

INT. FREEDOM 

Harry picks up the radio. 

Harry Give me Dan Golden. 

INTERCUT - MISSION CONTROL / FREEDOM 

Golden's handed the phone. 

Golden Yeah, Harry. What's your situation? 

INTERCUT - GOLDEN AND TEMPLE IN MISSION CONTROL / HARRY ON 
FREEDOM 

Harry Situation? You put me down on the worst possible place on 
this asteroid.  I'm drillin' into something I shouldn't. The hole 
just ate one of my  diamond-tipped bits in thirty minutes. That 
has never happened to me in twenty years. 

Golden You're forty minutes in. You should be down 150 feet. How 
far are you? 

Harry Not far. 
(beat)
 Twenty-three feet. 

CLOSE ON Golden as he looks at Temple. 

Temple This is an exercise in futility. 

Golden 
(to Harry)
 "Don't tell me what you can't do, tell me what you can."  
Remember that, Stamper? Go faster. 

Harry We will. 

Golden How? 

INT. FREEDOM CARGO BAY 

Sharp and Pitts enter. Fisk hands Sharp the phone. 

Sharp Sharp, over. 

PUSH IN on Sharp in EXTREME CLOSE-UP. His jaw tightens. His eyes 
dart. 

Sharp 
(cont'd)
 Sir, the bird can't fly. 

Temple 
(V.O.)
 Well, you need to get it fixed unless you want to die along with  
that asteroid. 

A LONG PAUSE, as Sharp listens. 

Sharp :
(cont'd)
 Yes, sir. 

Temple 
(V.O.)
 And, I don't want those drillers knowing about this. They have  
enough to worry about just drilling the damn ole. 

Collinswood 
(V.O.)
 Colonel Sharp, this is Chief of Staff Collinswood. Have  Pitts 
and Fisk prepare to detonate that nuke on the surface. Too many 
lives are  at stake here. Have them standing by. 

Sharp On your order sir. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - A TINY VALLEY - ESTABLISHING 

The gnarled WRECK OF SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE lies below. Twisted 
metal and cabin  materials strewn everywhere. 

INT. INDEPENDENCE CRASH SITE 

CAMERA moves through the wreckage of Independence. Nightmarish. 
EMERGENCY LIGHTS  still on battery flicker. The shattered 
windshield; the blown emergency hatch; A  CORPSE lies face down, 
helmet half on, half off; Independence's huge tubular  NUCLEAR 
DEVICE. 

Something moves on the ceiling. REVEAL A.J. hanging upside down, 
caught in the  twisted fuselage skin. A.J. cuts himself down. He 
twirls to the ground. Sees  LEGS MOVING UNDER RUBBLE. 

A.J. throws off the rubble, revealing Lev, dazed but alive. A.J. 
helps him to  his feet. 

Lev What happened to the others.... 

A.J. and Lev move toward the cockpit. 

A.J. 
(grabs the radio)
 Freedom, come in, over. Freedom, come in, over....  Freedom...? 
(shaking head)
 It's you and me. 

A.J. smashes the radio in frustration. 

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 

Chick and Bear screw on a new length of drill pipe. Chick engages 
the gears. The  drill pipe descends. THE TERMINATOR is working. 
Harry approaches from the  shuttle. 

Harry How far? 

Chick Almost 60 feet and startin' to kick ass! 

Suddenly GRRRR. CLANG. BANG. The drill pipe stops. Harry walks 
over to the hole. 



Chick 
(cont'd)
 That did not sound good. 

Harry Increase r.p.m. 

Chick throws the lever. The drill pipe turns faster, but still 
doesn,t descend.  Harry and the guys crowd around the drilling 
hole. 

Max Freaky, man.

Bear I got one of those big-time crappy feelings about this.

Harry We gotta get more power down to this bit. 
(thinks; looks up at Chick)
  Full throttle.

Chick You sure?

Harry Yeah, I'm sure.

Chick I don't think she can take it.

Harry She's gonna have to.

Chick The last time we ran her at full throttle we ripped her up!

Harry I don't have time to argue, Chick, now goddamn it, throttle 
up, or I'll  come up there and do it for you.

Chick reluctantly throws the lever to FULL THROTTLE. The TURBINE 
ENGINE ROARS.  The DRILL PIPE turns faster in the hole. The 
TURBINE ENGINE is shaking the  Armadillo. The drill pipe is 
descending again. Suddenly BANG!! The CLUTCH  rupture, spewing 
the CLUTCH PLATES and GEARS into space.

Harry Stop!

Chick throws it into reverse. Up comes THE TERMINATOR, CHEWED TO 
SHREDS. Bear  and Max look at it, then each other. Very worried 
now. 

Bear The Terminator's terminated.

Chick The clutch is dead.

Harry We're goin' to the second rig.

Harry stalks off toward the Shuttle.

Harry 
(cont'd)
 We need the second Armadillo.

Sharp We'll bring it out to you.

Harry moves to get his pipe tongs. Fisk and Pitts are next to the 
uncovered  nuclear bomb. Harry looks at the bomb.

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILL SITE

Chick, Bear and Max listen to Harry over the inter-crew link. 

INTERCUT WITH ABOVE.

INT. FREEDOM

Harry Why don't we cut to the chase, fellahs? What the fuck is 
going on with  that other nuke?

Harry stares at the nuclear weapon.

Sharp Stamper, if you can't drill the hole, we're detonating this 
thing on the  surface....

Chick and the guys eye each other. Harry walks off, pissed 
off....

INT. MISSION CONTROL

Golden and Clark are hunched over monitors. Two MILITARY AIDES 
carrying a  NUCLEAR COMMAND LINK 
(FOOTBALL)
 SUITCASE.

Golden, alarmed, tries to figure out what they have.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM

Chick, Bear and Max enter through the airlock. Everyone turns and 
stares at  Sharp. 

Sharp There's no way in hell you're gonna get that hole dug, and 
you know it. 

Harry Well, it wasn't my scientists that told me about the 
fucking fire  cracker inside the hand story. Are we detonating on 
the surface or are we gonna  drill? 

Bear I didn't come up here to die. 

Chick I say we drill. They say we have until Zero Barrier. 

Sharp 
(freaked out)
 That hole better be dug in two hours, or we're detonating.  
Whether you're on this godforsaken rock or not! 

Harry We're drilling.

Harry and his crew file out.

INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT

Golden 
(to Temple)
 What is going on up there?

Temple Your drillers aren't doing the job, Dan.

Golden After 15 minutes? What do you expect?

Temple Golden, we are preparing for surface detonation.

Golden A surface detonation isn't going to do it, General. My 
scientists have  already told you that. It must be detonated 
inside the asteroid. The alternative  is that the Earth  will be 
bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as  catastrophic. 

Temple stares off pensively into the sky.

Temple We have a lot better chance of surviving the "smaller 
matter." The  drillers have two hours 
(to the Aides)
 I want you ready on my command. 

The Adjutants prepare the nuclear command link.

Military Adjutant Sir, we have interface with the weapon. Remote 
detonator  standing by.

INT. INDEPENDENCE - CRASH SITE

Lev is sitting on the ground, head in his hands, completely 
demoralised.

Lev I feel like Skywalker Luke when he learn Darth Vader his 
father. What I  should do?

A.J. Get up, we got work to do.

Lev A.J., let me cash in my chips.

A.J. Lev, we're getting off this rock, if I have to drag your ass 
the whole  way. 
(off Lev's look)
 Now get up! 

A.J. walks into the Independence cargo bay, detached from the 
nose section. Then  climbs into Independence's Armadillo. 

A.J. C'MON LEV, PUT YOUR WEIGHT INTO IT!

EXT. INDEPENDENCE - WRECKAGE OF CARGO BAY

Lev is prying open the cargo bay ramp door 
(the hydraulics are shot)

LEV YOU COME PUSH, YANKEE....

INT. - MISSION CONTROL

Golden turns to Temple.

Golden The asteroid's surface is heating up.

Temple What does that mean?

Golden It means they may not be able to work on the surface for 
much longer.  The temperatures will be unbearable. 

EXT. INDEPENDENCE - WRECKAGE OF CARGO BAY 

The Armadillo, engine rumbling, is poised to roll Independence's 
long tubular  NUCLEAR WEAPON which has been ejected with other 
debris from the broken  fuselage. 

Lev Wait A.J.! We drive over nuclear weapon and we finished 
before we started. 

A.J. So move it. 

Lev jams a pipe between the ARMING DEVIC and the nuke. As he 
rolls the nuke  over, the arming device detaches, rips off, and 
clatters to the ground. 

INT. MISSION CONTROL 

Temple Golden, tell your drillers the clock is ticking. I have 6 
billion  people down here relying on them! 

In the b.d. hangs a crayon drawing of sunny day by Temple's 
daughter. 

Temple

 A lot of people are die.... 

INT. INDEPENDENCE - CRASH SITE 

The ARMADILLO blasts through the cargo bay door. A.J. and Lev 
roll off away from  the Independence. 

A.J. cranes his neck looking out through the Armadillo. A RIDGE 
with THRE TALL  SPIRES is in the distance, ringed with LIGHT from 
Freedom's FLOOD LIGHTS. 

A half-smile from A.J hope. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Sharp comes back from the cockpit, carrying the detonator. 
Harry's on the phone  to Golden. 

Harry ...You told me that the only way to deal with this hunk 'o 
crud is to  get a nuke 1000 feet down. You sticking with that? 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 Firmly. 

Harry Great. Glad we have that understanding. 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 IF you're gonna pull this off, we have to have a little talk  
about time...and temperature. Zero Barrier's in two hours. 

Harry Wait...wait..what about temperature? When did temperatures 
come into the  picture? 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 Harry, your suits are good upto 150 degrees Celsius.... 

Harry And...? How hot is it going to get? 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 We didn't anticipate you being on the asteroid so long. The  
clock is ticking... 

Harry How hot is it going to get?! 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 Three hundred and fifty degrees. 

Harry's face drops. 

Harry Thanks for telling us now, Golden....I don't think my bits 
can handle  those kind of temperatures.... 

INT. FREEDOM - CARGO BAY 

Harry clicks off the radio. 

Watts We've still gotta fix this shuttle, Stamper. 

Harry Give me some more good news. You've got two new assistants 
who can fix  your shuttle. Bear, Max, hop to it. There's not a 
machine they can't fix. We can  handle the hole from here. 

EXT. SHUTTLE FRREDOM

The airlock opens. Sharp and Pitts are led out by Harry.

Harry Colonel Sharp, if we're going to blow this hole, you gotta 
help ME. I  need some more manpower....

EXT. FREEDOM DRILL SITE - MINUTES LATER

The SECOND ARMADILLO rumbles out of Freedom's cargo bay. Chick 
and the  Roughnecks work like a NASCAR pit crew. Sharp and Pitts 
lay on their backs  holding down a 1000 pound axle, fighting 
zero-g. 

Suddenly, the ground begins to tremble.

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - FRONT OF "THREE SPIRES RIDGE"

A.J.'s ARMADILLO rumbles over a little hill revealing the RIDGE 
WTH THREE SPIRES  directly in front of them. THE SUN is moving 
over the asteroid's FAR HORIZON,  causing a "sunrise." It is 
breathtaking, spiritual...and frighteningly bright. 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

A.J. Over the hill.

Suddenly, the ground under the vehicle shakes sharply. A.J. stops 
the Armadillo.

The ground around the vehicle heaves up and down. The GROUND 
SPLITS. One  TECTONIC PLATE rises 15 feet in the air. The ground 
breaks like a wave, up and  down. 

INT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE

Here, too, the ground shakes. Bear, terrified, drops a DRILL 
PIPE. Max is shaken  to the ground.

Chick is nearly thrown off the Armadillo.

Chick Clear the rig!!!

Chick jumps down, bouncing. Everybody gets the hell away from the 
drilling hole.

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

The asteroid shakes violently, throwing A.J. and Lev around the 
cab. ROCKS BANK  down on the Armadillo's top and hood. The 
ASTEROID SURFACE continues splitting  apart across the slope's 
fall line. 

A.J. EARTHQUAKE!

The asteroid RUMBLES a few more seconds, then the quake slowly 
stops. All is  stll. 

A.J. 
(cont'd)
 Let's take a look. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE 

Lev gets out; he nervously paces back and forth across the lip of 
the fissure. 

Lev This bad. 
(repeating, mantra)
 Darth Vader. Darth Vader. 

A.J. Listen, Mr. Negative. Everyone thinks we're dead. We're not. 
So, suck it  up. Because if we don't drill that hole, six billion 
people are going to die.  And I'm not lettin' Harry Stamper get 
all the freaking credit for saving the world. 
(firm)
  We're gona do this, then we're going home. 

Lev I l-o-v-e this American confidence! Like John Wayne. 
(sotto)
 This why I  suspect you won Cold War. 

A.J. Hep me get these rocks over there. 

A.J. and Lev start dragging rocks to use as a "kicker ramp" for 
the jump. Lev is  oblivious. They pull embedded rock out, 
revealing DIAMONDS. A.J. holds up a  large chunk. 

A.J. 
(cont'd)
 This outta cut into a sweet wedding ring. 

Lev 
(holding chunk)
 With this I can rebuild my MIR. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Chick, Bear, and Max cautiously approach the drill hole. 
Everything seems okay.  Chick climbs back up to the drill-drive 
platform. 

Chick Back to work! 

Bear grabs the drill pipe and hoists it... back to work. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - "THREE SPIRES RIDGE" 

A.J. is walking along the GAPING, JAGGED FISSURE, 50 feet wide, 
50 feet deep,  stretching across the entire slope. 

Lev This bad, this very bad, very, very bad... 

A.J. Stick a cork in it, Lev. I'm tryin' to think. 

A.J. stares at the fissure, his eyes roaming from the 
fissure...to the  Armadillo...back to the fissure. 

A.J. 
(cont'd)
 Hop on the back. Get our weight distributed better. 

Lev 
(uncertain)
 And why to do this? 

A.J. Because I'm askin'. And turn your suit's thrusters off. 
Trust me, okay? 

A.J. gets in the Armadillo. Lev goes around back, climbs on the 
REAR BUMPER. He  clicks off his pressure suit's pro-gravity 
thrusters. 

Lev Okey-doke. 

The Armadillo begins backing down the slope. 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

A.J. throws it in neutral. The Armadillo stops. 

A.J. Hey, Lev, we're gonna see what this Porche engine can do.... 

He throws it in drive. The Armadillo lurches ahead. 

EXT. A.J..'S ARMADILLO - BACK BUMPER 

The Armadillo's REAR TIRES CHURN FORWARD, slinging rocks and 
gravel which, in  zero-g, shoot off in a stream into space, never 
falling. Lev holds on for dear  life. 

A.J.'S Armadillo churns up the slope like a Bronco 4X4, slinging 
gravel, heading  for THE JAGGED FISSURE. It FLIES over the 
fissure's edge as -- 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

-- A.J. punches the Armadillo's PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTER "OFF" 
SWITCH. 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - ROOF 

-- the Armadillo's roof-mounted PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS shut down. 

EXT. ASTEROID - "THREE SPIRES RIDGE" - JAGGED FISSURE 

The Armadillo, no longer thrusting downwardly, flies across the 
jagged fissure  in zero-g. The heavy steel vehicle doesn't fall. 
It ascends, and amazingly,  shoots across the entire 50 foot 
expanse of jagged fissure. 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - BACK BUMPER 

Lev looks down. The FISSURE passes beneath him, then SOLID GROUND 
again. They've  cleared the fissure....but they're not coming 
down. 

Lev A.J., up is bad! Down! 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

A.J. punches the PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTER "START" SWITCH. Nothing.... 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - BACK BUMPER 

The thruster nozzles SPUTTER, but no thrust. The Armadillo is 50 
feet off the  ground and still ascending...into outer space. Lev, 
his next stop being Planet  Mars, panics. He climbs the roof and 
peers inside the front windshield, POUNDING  ON THE WINDSHIELD. 

Lev Down! Not up! Up is bad! Down! 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

The Armadillo continues lifting into space, from which there is 
no return. A.J.  toggles the "start" switch. The swtich's 
INDICATOR LIGHT FLICKERS. 

A.J. HOLD ON, LEV, I GOT HER WORKIN'!! 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

Not quite. Only the right-front and right-rear THRUSTER NOZZLES 
fire, pushing  the right side downward, rolling the Armadillo 
over on its side. Lev, on the  bumper, clings to the rear-mounted 
TOW WINCH AND CABLE ASSEMBLY. 

Suspended in zero-g, on its side and in mid-air, the Armadillo is 
pushed by  thrusters, tires-first, against the SHEER, 90 DEGREE 
CLIFF FACE next to the  slope. All four Armadillo tires slam 
against the cliff. The Armadillo bounces  off. 

Lev, grabbing the Armadillo's TOWING CABLE, flies off the rear. 
The cable spools  out and LEV, hanging on for all he's worth, 
SLAMS against the cliff face and  descends.... 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

A.J., lying sideways, keeps toggling the thruster START SWITCH. 
The indicator  light finally FLASHES "IN" and A.J. rams it into 
drive -- 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - CLIFF FACE / ARMADILLO 

-- the Armadillo, all four thrusters now working, drives sideways 
across the  cliff face dragging Lev, who bounces against the 
cliff face and gradually falls,  until he's bouncing on the 
asteroid surface. 

The Armadillo finally falls down the cliff face and skids to a 
stop. 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

A.J., shaken, takes a deep breath and gets out. 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - REAR 

A.J. walks to the rear. Lev splayed out 50 feet from the back of 
the Armadillo,  covered in asteroid surface dirt and grime, looks 
up at him. 

Lev Very bad idea, A.J. 

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 

Harry orders his crew to start the drill up. The men drill a 
shitload of feet in  record time. They finally burst through the 
rock and hit easy sediment. 

The asteroid is spinning toward sunlight. Here, too, there is a 
sunrise. Bear's  face sweats inside the helmet. Chick's vision 
begins to blur. Tito takes a seat  on a nearby rock, exhausted. 

Chick Mutha...it's getting warm. 

Bear 
(worried)
 We got that sunrise, Harry. These bits are gonna fry up...... 

Suddenly the TRANSMISSION LINKAGE in the Armadillo BLOWS. 

Harry Goddamn it! 
(thinks)
 We'' take the tranny from the other rig! And if you  wanna 
complain about the heat, go to some other fucking 
asteroid....Toughen up. 

Sharp 
(to Roughnecks)
 Let's move it.....let's go, guys. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Chick and Bear yank the detached good TRANSMISSION HOUSING from 
inside Armadillo  2 and carry it across to Armadillo 1. 

INT. ARMADILLO 1 - CABIN 

Max finishes unbolting the BROKEN TRANSMISSION HOUSING. He passes 
it to Chick  who dumps it on the surface. Sharp and Truman work 
with Bear and Chick who feed  in the good transmission housing. 

Max presses the airlock. The doors close and the cabin 
pressurises. Max clicks  off his helmet. He begins installing the 
transmission housing and the linkage. 

EXT. ARMADILLO 1 

Chick and Bear, atop the drilling platform, begin installing the 
clutch plates  and transmission linkage. 

Harry Move guys, move it..... 

Bolting, bolting, bolting, connecting, connecting..... 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

Skip is analysing the asteroid's THERMAL READINGS. A MULTI-
COLORED THERMAL IMAGE  MAP shows most of the asteroid is GREEN

(heat)
. 

Skip Look at these thermals. This is BEFORE sunlight hits the

Max is bolting. The DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGE NEEDLE jolts. Max 
doesn't see it. He  keeps working. 

EXT. DRILLING SITE 

Harry's watching the work. Out of the corner of his eye... THE 
DRILLING ARM  KICKS. Harry turns to it. Nothing happens. His eyes 
move back to Chick and Bear,  then back to the drilling arm. It 
kicks up again. Just a few inches. 

Harry Chick. Unbolt the tranny. 

Chick We just put it in. 

Harry Do it. NOW. 

Chick, confused, starts unbolting the tranny. Suddenly the well 
kicks hard, one  foot high. Chick's jostled. BANG!! The RIG KICKS 
HARD, THREE FEET, bucking Chick  off. 

Chick scrambles back up to the drill platform. 

The ground shakes. a terrific TREMBLER rumbles through the 
valley. Harry, Max  and Bear cling to the side of the Armadillo. 
Chick's nearly thrown off. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 GET THE TRANNY OUTTA THERE! WE LOSE THE TRANNY, WE'RE DEAD  
MEN!! 

Harry climbs up to the DRILL PLATFORM. The GROUND SHAKES 
violently, throwing  harry and Chick around the top of the drill 
platform. 

Harry Max, you gotta get those bolts undone! 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max is furiously unbolting the TRANNY HOUSING. There are two 
bolts to go. He  ratches one off.... 

Max I'm doin' it, I'm doin' it. 

Max gets to the last bolt.... 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 Go Max, go Max, get the last bolt....! 

Max gets the last bolt undone. 

Max DONE!! 

EXT. ARMADILLO - DRILL PLATFORM 

Chick and Harry pull the unfastened TRANNY HOUSING out of the 
Armadillo as -- 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max stares at the DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGES, groping through the 
compartment for  his helmet. 

Max Pressure's through the roof! Shit, where's my helmet....!? 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Suddenly the DRILLING ARM jolts upward, lifting the ARMADILLO SIX 
FEET off the  ground. 

Chick She's gonna blow! 

Harry MAX, GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!!! 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max is thrown against a wall of the rear compartment. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The DRILLING ARM KICKS again, six feet this time, tossing the 
Armadillo over on  two wheels. 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max is SLAMMED against the wall again. Terrified, he grabs for 
his helmet and  locks the NECK SEALS. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

A DEEP RUMBLING emanates from the drilling hole, coming seemingly 
from the  ASTEROID'S CORE. Harry gets to his feet and SLAMS HIS 
FIST against the  Armadillo's SIDE. 

Harry CLEAR THE RIG! 

Everyone scatters.... 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max, helmet on, is frantically scrambling to the airlock, but 
there's no time... 



Max I CAN'T DEPRESSURIZE!! 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

WIth an awesome force, the DRILLING HOLE BLOWS. The DRILLING PIPE 
EXPLODES  upward, lifting the DRILLING ARM and the ENTIRE 
ARMADILLO VEHICLE with it. THE  ENTIRE RIG blows upward into 
space. 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max punches the DOOR LOCK without depressurising the cabin and is 
sucked  violently out of the rear compartment into open space. 

EXT. SPACE OVER ASTEROID SURFACE 

FIFTY FEET OF DRILL PIPE, THE DRILLING ARM, and the entire 
ARMADILLO RIG with  MAX trailing, BLOWS into space. MAX'S FACE is 
a screaming mask of terror and  confusion, reaching out, but 
there's no one to catch him....Harry and the guys  watch in 
helpless silence as the drill rig and Max ascend into space. 

Chick Max.....No. No. No. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

Skip motions to Golden. He comes over. 

Skip They just lost the rig. The hole blew out. 

Golden takes the news stoically. He thinks, looking across the 
room at Temple.  He looks at the clock. ONE HOUR AND FORTY 
MINUTES TO GO. 

Golden Say nothing. 

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 

Silence. A stark tableau. Harry and the men standing there, just 
watching.  Devastated, confused, in shock. This is a total 
catastrophe. The mission is  over. 

Sharp nods to Pitts. Pitts picks up the REMOTE NUCLEAR DETONATOR. 

Sharp Stamper, you ready to blow this? Let's get outta here...! 

Harry ignores him. He won't accept defeat. 

Harry Chick, get your butt over here. 

Chick drags his ass over to Harry. 

Chick Yeah. 

Harry We're gonna fix this - make it work. If we weld those two 
together and  go in one speed.... 

Chick Harry.... 

Harry Get your ass up here! 

Chick doesn't move. The two men stare at each other. 

Chick I've been with you fourteen years. I've never said this to 
you, never  thought I would. It's over. 

Chick walks off toward the shuttle. Bear joins him. 

Harry, atop of the Armadillo, looks around. His head drops...he's 
burning up.  His fist clenches the HALF MEDALLION in his hand 
(where is it - clipped to suit  - in pouch of suit?)
 His eyes shut tightly. He is going to will victory from  defeat. 
He will not give up. 

CAMERA'S at low angle, giving Harry a larger-than-life look. 

Harry hears something. A LOW RUMBLE. It is confusing. It sounds 
like......an  ARMADILLO ENGINE. 

Harry opens his eyes. He slowly turns and looks -- 

ACROSS THE VALLEY - ON THE DISTANT RIDGE - The front bumper of 
A.J.'s Armadillo  inches over the ridge crest. 

HARRY, for the first time on the asteroid, smiles. Miracles do 
happen. 

HARRY CHICK...BEAR!!! 

Chick and Bear about ready to enter the Freedom's airlock, stop 
and turn. They  see A.J.'S ARMADILLO ROARING down the hillside 
onto the drilling site. 

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 

A.J. and Lev roar up to the drilling site in the Independence's 
Armadillo. They  come down a hill spectacularly without brakes 
and it piles into shit, knocking  things down. 

Lev and A.J. bounce up to Chick and Bear.....hugs and high-fives 
go around. 

Bear A.J. Frost. Back from the dead. 

Chick Now you can die with us. 

Harry All the bits are gone, A.J. I've been inventing drill bits 
for  twenty-five years and I don't know what to use. 

A.J. You wouldn't happen to need a diamond tipper, would you? 

A.J. pulls out the POUCH OF DIAMONDS, found on the ridge. 

Harry Boys, we're back in business! 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

Golden stares at the wall. Grace is curled up on a chair in the 
corner. 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 We have good news folks. A.J. and the Russian just showed up. No  
other survivors. 

Grace shuts her eyes, smiling. Sobbing. 

EXT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AFTERNOON 

Chick shuts off an ARC WELDER and moves aside, letting Harry view 
a DRILL BIT  with A.J.'S DIAMONDS mounted on the top like 
diamonds in a ring setting. Harry  and the guys smile. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The NEWLY CREATED DRILL BIT lowers into the drilling hole and 
begins turning. It  CHEWS into the shit down below, WHIRRING and 
RIPPING and......descends quickly. 

Chick It worked! She's goin' through her like a hot knife through 
butter! 

BEGIN MONTAGE

The men drill a shitload of feet in very little time. It is a 
feverish pace,  their teamwork perfectly timed, as if 
choreographed.

Harry Time, A.J. 

A.J. One hour. 

Harry Distance, Chick. 

Chick Eight hundred and twenty feet, Harry. 

Harry We gotta do 180 in thirty minutes. 

Chick Downhole pressure's goin' through the roof! 

Harry Stop! Shut down. 

Chick throws the lever. The drill pipe stops turning. 

A.J. Harry, we can't stop. 

Harry Got to, kid. No choice. 

A.J. Drill right through the pressure to pay dirt. 

Harry That's crazy. 

A.J. Sometimes crazy works. 

Harry and A.J. stare at each other. 

Harry Chick, A.J.'s callin' this one. 

A.J. Full throttle! 

Chick throws the lever. The DRILL PIPE descends on full throttle. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

All the TECHNICIANS stand, staring at the CENTRAL BOARD, where a 
graph shows the  drilling progress. 

Flip Nine hundred and eighty...Nine ninety...they're into the 
fault, they're  doing it. 

Golden looks at the CLOCK. THIRTY-ONE MINUTES TO GO. He twists 
his wedding ring. 



Golden Now just get the thing in the hole. 

All the TECHNICIANS stare at their monitors. The atmosphere is 
thick with  tension. Clark chews his nails. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The HOLE'S finished, the drill pipe's been pulled; A.J. drives 
the ARMADILLO  safely away from the site. 

Watts and Sharp roll a GURNEY containing the NUCLEAR DEVICE 
(a massive stainless  steel tube)
 down Freedom's cargo bay RAMP toward the hole. Harry and all the  
Roughnecks stand by the HOLE. 

Harry One thousand feet. 

Chick 
(smiles)
 Thousand and three, Harry. With a half hour to spare. 

Sharp and Watts roll the NUCLEAR DEVICE GURNEY past the 
Roughnecks up to the  drilling hole. 

Harry Get the pipe and bit outta there. 

Chick gets inside the Armadillo. Grabs the stick-shift. 
Compresses the clutch  and throws it in reverse. 

THE DRILL PIPE begins to reverse out of the hole. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Skip She's gettin' hotter! Gotta mean gas - methane, helium, 
probably water  vapor. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The DRILL PIPE turns sloely, retracting from the hole. Bear, atop 
the drilling  platform, is working on something with a wrench. 

Bear accidently drops his wrench. It falls on the turbine's 
RIPPED MESH  PROTECTIVE SCREEN and hangs there. Bear looks at it 
nervously and reaches...THE  WRENCH falls into the turbine 
spinning at six-thousand r.p.m. With a GRINDING  SQUEAL, the 
wrench shrapnel blows out of the turbine and -- 

THE DRILLING ARM reverses speeds and VIOLENTLY THRUSTS THE PIPE 
FORWARD,  buckling it. A piece of the drill string is BLOWN OUT, 
smashing into Sharp's  helmet, spider-webbing his faceshield. 
He's out cold. 

Harry and the guys dive away from the hole. Chick, confused, 
works the clutch  furiously to no avail. THE DRILLING ARM RAMS 
THE PIPE back down the hole, where  it BUCKLES, BENDS AND BREAKS 
IN HALF. 

Tito tends to Sharp..his face has lost all color. Harry 
approaches the hole.  Looks down. FIFTY FEET DOWN IS A MESS OF 
MANGLED PIPE, blocking the hole. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

Golden continues looking at the THERMAL IMAGING. 

Golden Harry, c'mon, we got thirty minutes. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry Well, Dan, you're just going to have to goddamn wait 'CAUSE 
WE GOTTA BIG  PROBLEM UP HERE IN HELL. 
(turns to guys)
 Somebody's gotta go down there. 

Chick Don't look at me. 

Bear I can't even get my foot in there. 

Harry turns and eyes A.J.    A.J. stares down the hole. 

Harry Do or die, kid. 

CLOSE ON A.J. as he peers into the hole. 

A.J. Something I've been meaning to talk to you about. When this 
is all over  and we're back home, I'd like to marry your 
daughter.... 

Harry stares at A.J., the look priceless. 

A.J. 
(cont'd)
 Maybe I'll ask her again later.... 

Harry turns around..looking up at the star-filled sky. A.J. walks 
over to  Sharp...who's coming to now. 

Harry 
(to Golden)
 Oh yeah, Golden? 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 Go ahead, Harry. 

Harry Your shuttle pilot just took a nasty shot from a drill 
string.... 

Golden Is he alright? 

Harry I hope so, he's gotta get us off this shithole. 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

A.J, tied to a SAFETY TETHER, comes down the hole with a HAND-
HELD CUTTER and a  LENGTH OF ROPE. He reaches the obstruction. 
The DRILL PIPE has been mashed,  bent, buckled. Severed ends stab 
into the sides of the hole. A.J. starts cutting  with the hand-
held cutter. 

EXT. DRILLING HOLE 

The guys stand there, watching. Nothing happens. Agonising 
seconds pass.  Suddenly the ground rumbles. Another EARTHQUAKE. 
It slowly starts to subside. 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

The hole shakes. A.J. freezes, sweating. 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 A.J., we need you. I need everything you got. 

A.J. wrestles with the severed pipes, untangling them, tying the 
ROPE to them.  He gives the rope a tug. Chick and Bear, above, 
pull up the broken pipes. 

EXT. DRILLING HOLE 

Sharp Enter interface with the weapon. 

Pitts clicks a six digit code into a DIGITAL PAD on the DEVICE'S 
REMOTE  DETONATOR. 

Pitts Device armed. 

The NUCLEAR DEVICE has a small SLED with RATCHET WHEELS to let it 
slide down the  hole slowly. Sharp and Watts lift one end of the 
gurney. THE NUCLEAR DEVICE  slides off the gurney toward the 
MOUTH OF THE DRILLING HOLE. 

NT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

The thermal and seismic sensors BEING TRANSMITTED FROM FREEDOM 
START GOING CRAZY 



Skip It's a mess up there...! 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

ANOTHER TEMBLOR hits, the worst yet, 9.7 on Earth. Watts falls, 
losing her grip  on the gurney; her end collapses. THE NUCLEAR 
DEVICE lurches sideways off the  gurney and rolls away from the 
drilling hole...... 

The NUCLEAR DEVICE slides off the gurney.... 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

A.J. experiences the DEEPEST, MOST SINISTER RUMBLE YET, emanating 
form the  asteroid's core, something from hell. There's a 
horrendous WHOOSHING SOUND. 

A WINDSTORM OF PEBBLE, like a blowing tornado, whooshes up from 
the hole,  smashing into A.J.'S FACESHIELD. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Everyone whirls around in the sound's direction as -- 

ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR - A 100 FOOT METHANE GEYSER erupts, 
spewing a PLUME OF  HIDEOUS GREENISH GAS into space. Then another 
200 FEET HIGH! Another 500 FEET  HIGH! The ASTEROID has become 
alive. The geyser's eruptions loosen the  asteroid's surface 
material and -- 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

A.J. THIS SUCKS.... 

A.J. is whooshed violently out of the hole. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

PEBBLES AND HOT STEAM BLASTS from the drilling hole. Everyone 
recoils.... 

Harry Get back!! 

A.J. shoots out of the pipe, tethering the SAFETY LINE behind 
him, blowing into  space. The safety tether snaps and RIPS off. 
A.J. is 70 feet off the surface.  Harry dives for his ripped 
tether. Catching it, inches before A.J.'s thrown into  space. 

Harry and Bear grab A.J.'s safety tether and begin to pull him 
down. Chick  stares at something O.S., his jaw drops. 

Chick This thing definitely doesn't like us. 

CHUNKS OF THE ASTEROID, some as big as trucks, others as big as 
houses, dislodge  from the ASTEROID SURFACE and, slowly at first, 
but with terrifyingly increasing  speed and momentum..... 

.... they start rolling. 

HARRY AND THE GUYS just stand there, disbelieving what they're 
seeing. 

On come the ROCKS and ICE CHUNKS, rolling. As they hit smaller 
surface rocks,  they take little hops, and bigger hops, until 
they are BOUNDING across the  surface. Harry lashes A.J.'s tether 
to the Armadillo. 

Harry and the guys run for their lives. 

In the midst of this -- 

-- A 500 FOOT HIGH GEYSER erupts next to the drilling hole. Pitts 
gets blasted  by the geyser, which blows him across the asteroid 
floor, SLAMMING him into the  parked Armadillo. A BOULDER rolls 
at Pitts and squashes him against the  ARMADILLO , killing him. 

A 20 FOOT ICE BOULDER rolls toward A.J.'s SAFETY TETHER. 

A.J., suspended 70 feet off the asteroid surface, looks down at 
the ONCOMING ICE  BOULDER. A.J., terrified, tries to unbuckle the 
tether, but he can't in time. 

The boulder hits A.J.'s tether, rolling over it, flattening it to 
the asteroid  surface, which causes -- 

--A.J., with a JOLT, to be yanked toward the surface. A.J. 
scrambles with his  safety harness. 

Chick, next to the Armadillo, sees A.J.'s plight. He dives 
inside, engages the  gears. The Armadillo ROARS toward the 
oncoming ICE BOULDER. 

A.J., terrified, continues to descend as -- 

Chick, driving the Armadillo, rams the ICE BOULDER just as it's 
about to roll  over A.J. The boulder hops up, SMASHES down on the 
Armadillo's hood, CRUSHING  the steel compartment around Chick, 
and gently rolls over onto -- 

A.J., who log-rolls under the Armadillo, as the ice boulder 
WHOMPS down and  keeps rolling. 

THE NUCLEAR DEVICE is rolling across the asteroid's surface. 
Pebbles and debris  CLANGING off the device's REMOTE 
DETONATOR..... 

Harry bounds toward the Armadillo. THE LARGEST, JAGGED ROCK rolls 
at the  vehicle. Harry's caught. There's no place to turn. The 
rocks rolls straight at  him. Twenty feet....10 feet....Harry 
FALLS heavily to the ground. 

Harry gets up and dives down inside a fox-hoe-sized INDENTATION 
in the asteroid  surface.... 

The BOULDER rolls right over him. 

Finally the quake stops. The situation stabilises. Everyone gets 
to their feet.  Harry and A.J. get up. They look off at -- 

The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling away in the distance, smashing into 
other rock  formations. 

Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs 
one. Holds it  up, marvelling at it. The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling 
away in the distance,  smashing into other rock formations. 

Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs 
one. Holds it  up, marvelling at it. 

Sharp, with bruises on his face, looks through his cracked 
faceshield down at  Pitt's corpse. 

Sharp He's dead. 

Harry Put it down, Chick. 

Chick tosses down the diamond and follows Harry. Everyone checks 
themselves.  Looks at others. There's no talk, no time to lose. 
They reconvene, by the  NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's dented. The 
alumniium gurney is smashed, mangled. 

Sharp Three on that side, the rest over here. 

They hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole. 
They plug one  end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the 
other. The NUKE begins to  insert down the hole. Suddenly Sharp 
tries to grab a TUBULAR PIECE OF ALUMINIUM  from the broken 
gurney. 

Sharp 
(cont'd)
 Stop...! 

-- rams it into the wheels of the NUKE'S RATCHET-WHEEL DELIVERY 
SLED. The nuke  stops inserting into the hole. Sharp inspects the 
REMOTE DETONATOR. 

Sharp 
(cont'd)
 The remote's shot. 
(looks up)
 It'll have to be manually  detonated. 

Chick What's that mean? 

Pause. 

Harry Means one of us ain't leaving. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Golden addresses the room. 

Golden The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote 
detonator is not  functional. One of the crew is going to stay 
behind and....
(deep breath)
  ...manually detonate the device. 

Golden looks over at Grace. She is stunned. The news is just 
sinking in. 

Golden Don't stay for this. 

Grace I'm not leaving. 

Temple In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier. 
(to Grace)
 Your father better  be a man of his word. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CABIN 

PAN FROM HARRY...to A.J. to...to Chick....to Lev...to Bear. 
Everyone is huddled  inside the cabin. 

The SMASHED REMOTE DETONATOR, a 2000-foot spool-drum of 
ELECTRICAL WIRE and a  KNIFE sit on the table. 

Sharp 
(stoically)
 I'd trade places with any one of you. But we need two people  to 
fly this mother back. So, we either all stay or you guys draw. 

Sharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. The crew's 
going to draw  straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes, 
no one moves. 

Sharp Who's first? 
(no response)
 Clockwise then. 

Sharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev. 

Lev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws. 
The strand is  LONG. Lev exhales. Next... 

Chick, Chick stares at the bundle, sweating. He grabs a strand. 
Pulls slowly.  LONG. He exhales. Next... 

Bear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and 
pulls quickly,  decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two 
men, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s  turn.... 

A.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts 
in his chair.  The matter will be decided on this last pull. A.J. 
looks at Harry. They lock  eyes. 

Harry Your turn. 

A.J. I ain't gonna draw against you Harry. 

Chick 
(starts to get up)
 I can't watch this. 

Harry 
(stern, hard)
 Sit down, Chick. 

Chick sits down. Harry looks at A.J. 

Harry Draw. 

A.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches 
and begins to  pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls. 
It is SHORT. A.J. stares at  the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his 
hand. We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a small 
smile. 

A.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the 
Earth. 

A.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half 
medallion. 

A.J. We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole. It just 
ain't gonna be  on Earth. 

They slide the two halves together to make a whole. Harry and 
A.J. exchange a  long look.

Harry and A.J. approach the NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's half in, half 
out of the  drilling hole, as they left it. Harry and A.J. 
alligator-clamp the end of the  wire spool-drum onto the nuke's 
DETONATION DEVICE. 

A.J You never answered my question. 

They finish attaching the wire. 

A.J. pulls the piece of TUBULAR ALUMINIUM out of the nuke's 
ratchet wheel  delivery sled. The NUKE descends downhole, slowly 
spooling out wire from the  SPOOL DRUM. 

A.J. About Grace, Harry. 
(laughs nervously)
 I know it ain't gonna happen now,  but....if things were 
different...What would you say...? 

Harry walks back toward Freedom. A.J. follows. 

Harry I always wanted a son. And if I had....I'd want him to be 
like you. 

Harry hands him the pipe section. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 You're going to need some magic in the world. You can marry  
her, A.J. 

A.J. laughs, being told at this dire time in his life. He looks 
at Harry with a  hint of bittersweet smile. 

A.J. Mean "could have...?" 

Harry No. Go home, A.J. Marry Grace. 

A.J. I'm not going home Harry. 

With one hand, Harry stabs the airlock door, and then with a 
small pipe clamp,  rips A.J.'s air tubes off. 

Harry It's my hole, I drilled it, and I'm staying with it till 
the end. 

Harry grabs him, throws his kicking, screaming body into the

 Sharp, I NEED A SOLUTION! 

BACK TO LEV , Watts and Sharp. 

Sharp Sir with all due respect, if I knew the PROBLEM, I'd give a 
SOLUTION,  SIR..! 

Temple Well, find a solution!! 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry is looking at the shuttle. Close-Up on finger ready to pull 
the trigger. 

Harry SHARP, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? GET THE HELL OUT OF 
HERE! 

Harry's eyes close as the clock counts -10...-11...-12. 

Temple STAMPER DETONATE! 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - SERVICE HATCH 

Lev 
(to Watts)
 WE HAVE JUST THE SAME SHIT PART IN RUSSIA!! SOMETIMES IT NOT  
WORK SO WE HIT!! YOU GOTTA GIVE IT WHACK!! WHACK!! HIT!! 

Watts WHAT!!? 

Lev GIVE IT WHACK!! 

Lev grab a wrench and goes ballistic. SMASHES it down on the 
component, AGAIN  and AGAIN and AGAIN. We hear JET FUEL COURSE 
through the component and -- 

-- SHARP hits the IGNITION SWITCH and the THRUSTERS FIRE. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Shuttle Freedom lifts off the asteroid on full REVERSE THRUSTER 
POWER, like a  Harrier jet. It ascends backwards, falling away 
from the asteroid, away from  Earth, toward the Moon. 

Harry is a solitary figure, left behind. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Sharp, Watts, A.J., Lev and Bear watch Harry becoming smaller and 
smaller on the  asteroid. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry takes his final breaths. Looks around. 

Harry All right, son-of-a-bitch, it's just you and me.... 

Harry's FINGER compresses on the detonator button.... 

A GEYSER OF STEAM next to the drilling hole BLAT up to five feet 
away. A SECOND  GEYSER, directly underneath Harry, BLOWS. The 
MANUAL DETONATOR flies from  Harry's hand as he's knocked 
backward -- 

-- into the drilling hole! 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

Harry falls ass-first down the hole, his PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS 
pushing him  further and further down. Harry's FINGERS GOUGE into 
the walls of the hole. He  scissors his legs. HIS BOOTS scrape 
the sides. He begins climbing up out of the  hole....We see that 
his air has been punctured. He's losing pressure. He starts  to 
choke. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

They've ascended to a safe distance. 

Sharp Something's wrong. 

A.J. Don't worry. He'll come through. 

Sharp We should have detonation by now. 

A.J. Harry doesn't fail. 

Sharp We're going back. 

A.J. What? 

Sharp Every life, that you know, will die....unless that nuke is 
detonated. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

HARRY'S GLOVED HANDS grip the sides of the hole. Then his helmet 
appears. He  looks across the asteroid surface to the MANUAL 
DETONATOR, lying in the dirt. 

The nuke has now descended several hundred feet into the hole. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

WE MOVE DOWN the faces of the terrified men, looking down on the 
craggy  asteroid.... 

Chick 
(unsure)
 That means we might die too.... 

Sharp Watts, prepare for re-landing. NOW!! 

Watts, frozen with fear, begins hitting switches. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry crawls out of the hole. 

The nuke is at the bottom of the hole. Harry runs, gasping for 
air, bounding  across the asteroid surface, dodging geysers and 
rolling debris. He dives for  the detonator. He stares long and 
hard. A TEAR wells in his eye. His finger  presses on the 
detonator...sweat pours over his face.... 

Harry I beat you. 

SLOW-MOTION CLOSE-UP on Harry's finger as it presses the 
detonator. 

EXT. SPACE 

The nuclear device DETONATES. A spectacular concussion. The 
ASTEROID SPLITS in  two halves, as planned, like a split diamond. 
The TWO BLOWN PIECES wing off into  space, on new vector angles 
which might miss the Earth.... 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

The detonation ROCKS the cabin. Everyone's violently buffeted 
around. 

Watts Houston, we have detonation! 

Watts fumbles for the reverse switches as the flames from the 
explosion grow  CLOSER....She hits the directional THRUSTERS, 
jamming it as hard as it will  go...the flames bite up at them. 
The shuttle veers off toward Earth. 

A.J. Harry.... 

A.J. and the others stare out the cockpit window as the NUCLEAR 
FISSION  EXPLOSION FLAMES OUT, the halves of the asteroid wing 
off. 

EXT. AROUND THE WORLD - MONTAGE OF IMAGES 

IN EXTREME SLOW MO, we see images around the world. WALL STREET 
deserted....a  crowded BAR with people huddled around a 
T.V....Extremely tight on a TEAR  falling form a woman's 
face....ENGLISH FARMERS in a corn field.....a FATHER  holding his 
SON as they watch the brilliant flaming sky....Golden closes his  
eyes and falls to his seat....Arms raise in unison....PEOPLE 
embrace....AT THE  PYRAMIDS, dappled in firelight, hundreds 
praying.... 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Grace is quietly weeping. 

THE ASTEROID'S DETONATION is computer-imaged on the Central 
Board. WE SEE the  ASTEROID'S TWO HALVES, moving in new 
directions. The Technicians stare in  wonderment. 

Golden Where are they, Flip? Give me some angles, give me some 
directions,  give me speeds... 

Flip 
(analysing new data)
 The new courses are....they're gonna miss us! 

The Technicians CHEER. Grace looks up. Wipes her tears. Golden 
approaches her. 

Golden I just want to tell you I'm proud to know the daughter of 
the man who  just saved the world. 

EXT. ARIZONA - SHUTTLE LANDING AREA 

Shuttle Freedom touches down. N.A.S.A. QUARANTINE VEHICLES race 
out to meet it. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

N.A.S.A.TEHNICIANS sit at consoles, exhausted. There are Coke 
cans, coffee mugs,  cigarettes overflowing ashtrays. Jimbo, Theo 
and Pearl, wearing V.I.P. VISITORS  BUTTONS, stand at the back. 

Jimbo This definitely doesn't look like a glamorous job. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

A.J., Chick and Bear unbuckle, begin to rise from seats. 

Chick I'm dyin' for a Budweiser. 

Sharp Stay seated. Let the medical quarantine trucks set up. 

Bear I ain't gettin' another enema from Nurse Ratchet. 

A.J., Chick and Bear look at each other. 

A.J. What would Harry do? 

Bear I think he'd go get a beer. 

EXT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

The EMERGENCY HATCH DOOR BLOWS in front of surprised N.A.S.A. 
QUARANTINE  TECHNICIANS. 

EXT. ARIZONA - SHUTTLE LANDING AREA 

A.J., Chick and Bear walk away from the shuttle. All he N.A.S.A. 
QUARANTINE  MEDICS are looking for them. 

Chick What are you lookin' at? 

Bear Yeah, okay, you're right, we're the studs who just blew up 
the Death  Star. 

A wave of fans are held back by MILITARY POLICE. 

Sharp, holding his shoulder in pain, is helped across the tarmac 
by Watts. A VET  BYSTANDER comes up to Sharp and drapes an 
American flag over his shoulders. 

Temple, with a huge grin, approaches Sharp. Temple salutes Sharp. 

Among the masses, Chick catches sight of Denise. Tommy stands 
next to her,  waving a small flag, proud as can be. 

Grace runs toward A.J.; he sees her and runs to her. 

They fall into each others arms. Grace is crying. A.J. is crying. 
They kiss.  A.J. looks up at the sky. 

A.J. He's up there, Grace. And he'll never die. Will you marry 
me? I gotcha a  new rock.... 

A.J. pulls out one of the DIAMONDS from the asteroid surface, as 
big as a  doorknob, about two thousand karats. It glitters in the 
sunlight. Grace stares  at it, agog. 

As we PULL BACK and CAMERA TILTS TO THE SKIES ABOVE. 

Where Harry Stamper's soul remains.....

          THE SOUND OF DRUMS, from a great distance, growing louder.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          WE ARE FLYING through mist, a dimly glimpsed forest below.
          
                               VOICE (V.O.)
                     When I was lying there in the VA
                     hospital, with a big hole blown through
                     the middle of my life, I started having
                     these dreams of flying.
          
          We are very low over the forest now, gliding fast, the drums
          BUILDING to a PEAK --
          
                               VOICE (V.O.)
                     Sooner or later though, you always have
                     to wake up...
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. CITY - NIGHT
          
          A SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing --
          
          JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a
          beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are
          hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured
          pain beyond his years.
          
          Jake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS
          WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish
          advertizing.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                     They can fix a spinal, if you've got the
                     money. But not on vet benefits, not in
                     this economy.
          
          The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the
          crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people
          wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a
          LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous,
          isolated souls.
          
          INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          The room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom.
          Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. --
          
                               PERKY NEWSCASTER
                     The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a
                     century, is making a comeback. These
                     cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
                     are...
          
                                                                       2.
          
          
          
          Jake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side,
          pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the
          other, and so on.
          
          His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his
          arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A "Born Loser"
          tattoo prominent on his shoulder.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I became a Marine for the hardship. To
                    be hammered on the anvil of life. I told
                    myself I could pass any test a man can
                    pass.
          
          Jake struggles with his pants a long time.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. ROWDY BAR -- NIGHT
          
          Not the kind of place you'd bring your mom.
          
          We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front
          wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his
          forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets,
          CLAP and WHOOP.
          
          Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer.
          
          A WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men
          RUNNING on antelope legs.
          
          CU JAKE, watching what he can't have.    Expression stony.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Let's get it straight up front. I don't
                    want your pity. I know the world's a
                    cold-ass bitch.
          
          Jake's eyes shift   -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in
          the crowd. A MAN    on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with.
          Hard. She cowers    but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his
          fist. An eternal    tableau. People look away.
          
          CU JAKE -- not looking away.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong
                    planet. The strong prey on the weak.
          
          TIGHT ON JAKE'S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his
          chair.
          
          TRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward.
          
                                                                        3.
          
          
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's just the way things are.   And nobody
                    does a damn thing.
          
          Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans
          down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS.
          
          The chair flips.   The guy goes down HARD and --
          
          JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy,
          getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap
          out of him, right there on the floor.
          
          THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into
          SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling...
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life
                    was a single thing worth fighting for.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT
          
          THE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on
          the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him,
          banging across the alley, landing in the trash.
          
          Jake struggles to rise on one elbow. He's bleeding and
          bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.
          
                              JAKE
                    I hope you realize you've just lost a
                    customer!
          
          He collapses onto his back, panting.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to himself)
                    Candy ass bitch.
          
          He stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR
          overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking --
          then shouts jauntily to no one in particular --
          
                              JAKE
                    If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled
          amongst the trash, getting drenched.
          
          TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him.
          
                                                                       4.
          
          
          
          Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him.   He
          squints up at --
          
          TWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and
          blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors.
          
                              AGENT 1
                    Are you Jake Sully?
          
                                JAKE
                    Step off.    You're ruinin' my good mood.
          
                              AGENT 2
                    It's about your brother.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHT
          
          DOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER
          FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN'S FACE. He
          looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His
          IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The strong prey on the weak. A guy with
                    a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for
                    the paper in his wallet.
          
          WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech
          CREMATORIUM -- a row of stainless steel furnaces. Jake
          stares down at his own face.
          
                              JAKE
                    Jesus, Tommy.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The Suits' concern was touching.
          
                              AGENT 1
                    Your brother represented a significant
                    investment. We'd like to talk to you
                    about taking over his contract.
          
          The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape
          dispenser, like it's a package for shipping. The cardboard
          coffin is rolled into the furnace.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The egghead and the jarhead.   Tommy was
                    the scientist, not me. He was the one
                    who wanted to get shot light years out
                    into space to find the answers.
          
                                                                       5.
          
          
          
          PUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Me -- I was just another dumb grunt
                    gettin' sent someplace I was gonna
                    regret.
          
          INSIDE THE FURNACE the burners quickly eat away the
          cardboard; TOMMY'S FACE is, for a moment, wreathed in flame
          but not touched by it, as we --
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          JAKE'S FACE, in icy darkness. CLOSE ON his eyes -- they OPEN
          suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- the inside of a metal coffin. A SERVO WHINE
          and we are moving, emerging into a large chamber --
          
          INT. CRYO VAULT
          
          JAKE'S POV -- A TECH in medical scrubs FLOATS WEIGHTLESSLY
          toward us. Wherever we are, we're not on Earth.
          
          Jake squints as the lights flicker on, revealing --
          
          WIDE SHOT -- the multi-tiered CRYO VAULT. Hundreds of CRYO-
          CAPSULES are opening like morgue drawers, as med techs pull
          themselves about in ZERO-G, tending to their patients.
          
                              JAKE
                        (a hoarse whisper)
                    Are we there?
          
                              MED TECH
                    We're there, Sunshine.
          
          TIME CUT -- SCORES OF PEOPLE emerge from their cryo-capsules
          in ZERO-G. Pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open
          coffins.
          
          The MED TECH floats among them, using his announcement voice.
          
                              MED TECH
                    People, you have been in cryo for five
                    years, nine months and twenty two days.
                    You will be hungry, you will be weak. If
                    you feel nausea, please use the sacks
                    provided for your convenience. The staff
                    thanks you in advance.
          
                                                                        6.
          
          
          
          FOLLOWING JAKE as he pushes away from his capsule, gliding to
          the LOCKERS across the aisle, his paralyzed legs not an
          impediment in weightlessness.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SPACE
          
          Against the cold infinity   of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR
          SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE   STAR. As it moves past like an
          endless train, we realize   this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half
          a mile long. PAN WITH IT    180 to REVEAL --
          
          A GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of
          moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face.
          
          The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a
          blue and surprisingly Earth-like world called PANDORA. The
          ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. PANDORA ORBIT
          
          ISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the
          sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora.
          
          CLOSE ON ISV -- two massive "VALKYRIE" SHUTTLES are mated to
          a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and
          moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts.
          
          As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear
          the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we--
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - TWILIGHT
          
          FLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas
          carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around
          the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding.
          
          The trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are
          waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES.
          
          Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to --
          
          AN OPEN-PIT MINE. A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie-
          cutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the
          terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story
          buildings.
          
          And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY --
          
                                                                       7.
          
          
          
          EXT. HELL'S GATE - TWILIGHT
          
          HELL'S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel
          structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high,
          topped with razor wire.
          
          At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS
          swiveling on servo mounts.
          
          Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in
          across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle,
          bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER.
          
          EXT. RAIN FOREST - TWILIGHT
          
          Through a screen of jungle canopy, we see the VALKYRIE
          thunder overhead. Camera TILTS with it until leaves block
          the view.
          
          A BLUE INHUMAN HAND reaches INTO SHOT, parting the foliage to
          reveal the shuttle hover-taxiing across the compound.
          
          REVERSE -- ECU of two intense, cat-like golden EYES watching.
          
          INT./EXT. SHUTTLE
          
          The CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling --
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Exopacks on!
          
          Passengers don their EXO-PACK breathing gear with practiced
          moves. Everybody except JAKE, who's turning his this way and
          that trying to figure out the straps.
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Remember people, you lose your mask
                    you're unconscious in 20 seconds and
                    you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody
                    be dead today, it looks bad on my report.
          
          The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark --
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Exopack on, let's go!
          
          BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter
          radius as it settles onto its landing gear.
          
          INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles
          ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks --
          and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the
          level of everyone else's WAISTS.
          
                                                                        8.
          
          
          
          THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine.
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Go directly into the base! Do not stop!
                    Go straight inside!
          
          HAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double
          time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward
          a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex.
          
          Inside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS
          TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops
          is the colony's private security force. These guys are laid
          back, hardened, and haggard.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Look at all that new meat.
          
          THEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp.
          
                              FIKE
                    Check it out, man.    Meals on wheels.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    That is just wrong.
          
          Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as --
          
          A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy
          wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires --
          ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the
          advanced technology.
          
          Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and
          heavily armed, they are AT-99 "SCORPION" GUNSHIPS.
          
          MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4
          meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily
          armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.
          
          Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds
          of feet high.   A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS
          light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off
          the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege.
          
          WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball
          as he approaches.
          
                              JAKE
                    What're you two limpdicks starin' at?
          
          As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and --
          
                                                                          9.
          
          
          
          K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his
          head.
          
          A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs
          against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link
          with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT.
          
          WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.   It drops off
          the fence, tail still lashing.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a
                    wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up
                    in one.
          
          Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien.
          
          ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED
          FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair
          through the tunnel below.
          
          The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long
          parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked
          across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem
          hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars.
          
          The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.    He eyes
          are an icy steel gray.
          
          HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky,
          beyond the clouds.
          
                              MAN (V.O.)
                    You are not in Kansas any more...
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMISSARY - TWILIGHT
          
          THE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the
          HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell's Gate colony. A hundred new
          arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the
          front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide.
          
          Without his mask, we see that Quaritch's features are rugged
          and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to
          jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very
          large PISTOL.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    ... You are on Pandora, ladies and
                    gentlemen. Respect that fact every second
                    of every day.
          
                                                                       10.
          
          
          
          JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back.
          
          COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window,
          toward the dark treeline.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Out beyond that fence every living thing
                    that crawls, flies or squats in the mud
                    wants to kill you and eat your eyes for
                    jujubees.
          
          The room gets very quiet.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    We have an indigenous population of
                    humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're
                    fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin
                    which can stop your heart in one minute.
                    We operate -- we live -- at a constant
                    threat condition yellow.
          
          PAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Cat-machine drivers,
          engineers, geologists, as they take that in.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    As head of security, it's my job to keep
                    you alive.    I will not succeed --
                        (pausing for effect)
                    -- not with all of you. If you wish to
                    survive, you need a strong mental
                    attitude, you need to follow procedure...
          
          PUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues.

                    Nothing like an old-school safety brief
                    to put your mind at ease.

          People are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms,
          lugging duffels and cases.
          
          An eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an
          overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake.
          
                              NORM
                    Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother?
                    You look just like him.
                        (off Jake's wary look)
                    Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through
                    avatar training with him.
          
                                                                         11.
          
          
          
          Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it.
          
                              NORM
                    He was a great guy -- funny.     It was a
                    big shock to all of us.
          
                               JAKE
                    Yeah.
          
          Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on.       Norm walks
          with him.
          
                              NORM
                    And duh! -- obviously you look like him.
                    I mean, if you weren't genetically
                    identical, you wouldn't be taking over
                    his avatar.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's why I'm here.

                    So -- you want to go check it out?

                    remotely controlled bodies called
                    avatars. They're grown from human DNA
                    mixed with DNA from the natives here.
          
          A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the
          uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the
          sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK.
          
          Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by
          some unseen force, toward --
          
          THE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside,
          which looks like a man. A very large, very blue, man.
          
          Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the
          abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see
          that it has a lemur-like TAIL. The skin is cyan-blue. Long
          black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed.
          
                               JAKE
                    Damn.   They got big.
          
                                                                       12.
          
          
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah, they mature on the trip out.
                        (to Max)
                    So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty
                    well.
          
                              MAX
                    Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give
                    us a few hours, you guys can take them
                    for a spin.
          
          THE FIGURE'S sleeping face turns toward us, and the features
          are -- despite feline ears and a long feral snout --
          definitely JAKE'S.
          
                              JAKE
                    It looks like him.
          
                              NORM
                    No, it looks like you.   This is your
                    avatar now, Jake.
          
          ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The idea is -- every driver is matched to
                    his own avatar --
          
          STEREOCAM VIDEO SHOT OF JAKE -- facing the camera, talking
          directly to the lens. JAKE'S VOICE-OVER up until now has
          been part of this VIDEOLOG.
          
                               JAKE
                    -- so their nervous systems are in tune.
                    Or something. Which is why they offered
                    me this gig, because I can link with
                    Tommy's avatar, which was insanely
                    expensive.
                        (looking off camera)
                    Is this right? I just say whatever in
                    these videologs?
          
          WIDER, showing Norm working nearby with Max.
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah. You just need to get in the habit
                    of documenting everything -- what you
                    see, what you feel -- it's all part of
                    the science. Good science starts with
                    good observation.
          
                                                                     13.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    Right.
                        (to camera)
                    So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.
                        (looks around)
                    Never been in a lab before.
          
                              MAX
                    Log off. It's time to meet your boss for
                    the next five years.
          
          He leads Jake and Norm through the short corridor to the --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - DUSK
          
          The LINK ROOM contains a dozen PSIONIC LINK UNITS, which look
          like coffins crossed with MRI scanners.
          
                              NORM
                    Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the
                    head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote
                    the book -- I mean literally wrote the
                    book -- on Pandoran botany.
          
                              MAX
                        (low, over his shoulder)
                    That's because she likes plants better
                    than people.
          
          DR. GRACE AUGUSTINE sits up in her link, stretching and
          cracking her neck after a long session. She's fifty, with a
          strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes.
          
                              GRACE
                        (YELLING)
                    Who's got my goddamn cigarette?!
          
          A TECH scurries to bring it to her, already lit.   Around here
          they jump when Grace barks.
          
          Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach.
          
                              MAX
                    And here she is, Cinderella back from the
                    ball. Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm
                    Spellman and Ja --
          
                              GRACE
                    Norm. I hear good things about you.
                    How's your Na'vi?
          
                                                                    14.
          
          
          
                              NORM
                        (Na'vi, subtitled)
                    May the All Mother smile upon our first
                    meeting.
          
          Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette.
          
                              GRACE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Not bad. You sound a little formal.
          
                              NORM
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    There is still much to learn.
          
          Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na'vi.
          
                              MAX
                    Uh, Grace, this is Jake S----
          
                              GRACE
                        (turning to Jake)
                    Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I
                    don't need you. I need your brother.
                        (to Max)
                    You know -- the PhD who trained three
                    years for this mission.
          
                              JAKE
                    He's dead. I know it's a big
                    inconvenience to everyone.
          
                              GRACE
                    How much lab training have you had?   Ever
                    run a gas chromatograph?
          
                                 JAKE
                    No.
          
                              GRACE
                    Any actual lab work at all?
          
                              JAKE
                    High school chemistry.   But I ditched.
          
          Grace wheels on Max.
          
                              GRACE
                    You see? You see? They're pissing on us
                    without even the courtesy of calling it
                    rain.
                        (turning away)
                    I'm going to Selfridge.
          
                                                                     15.
          
          
          
          She shoves past Jake.
          
                              MAX
                    Grace, that's not a good idea.
          
          But she's already out the door and clomping down the
          corridor. Max turns to Jake with a pained look.
          
                              MAX
                    Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred.   Try to
                    use big words.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DUSK
          
          It looks like an air-traffic control tower, with lots of
          screens and bay windows showing the whole complex.
          
          ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly
          opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor. Selfridge
          is young, charismatic, focused. Some would say ruthless.
          
          He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a
          practice cup across the control room floor. He glances up as
          Grace strides toward him.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, I used to think it was benign
                    neglect, but now I see you're
                    intentionally screwing us.
          
                               SELFRIDGE
                    Grace.   You know I enjoy our little
                    talks.
          
                              GRACE
                    I need a research assistant, not some
                    jarhead dropout.
          
          Selfridge looks down and hits the ball.
          
          Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past.
          Selfridge looks at her with a sigh.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Actually, we got lucky with him.
          
                               GRACE
                    Lucky?   How is this in any way lucky?
          
          As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball --
          
                                                                    16.
          
          
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Well -- lucky your guy had a twin
                    brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an
                    oral hygienist or something. A Marine we
                    can use. I'm assigning him to your team
                    as security escort.
          
                              GRACE
                    The last thing I need is another trigger
                    happy asshole out there!
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Look, you're supposed to be winning the
                    hearts and minds of the natives. Isn't
                    that the whole point of your little
                    puppet show? If you look like them, if
                    you talk like them, they'll trust you?
          
          Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby.
          Grace follows.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    But after -- how many years? -- relations
                    with the indigenous are only getting
                    worse.
          
                              GRACE
                    That tends to happen when you use machine
                    guns on them.
          
          On Selfridge's desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid-
          air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK.
          Pure UNOBTANIUM. He grabs it and holds it up between thumb
          and forefinger, in front of Grace's eyes.
          
                               SELFRIDGE
                    This is why we're here. Unobtanium.
                    Because this little gray rock sells for
                    twenty million a kilo. No other reason.
                    This is what pays for the party. And
                    it's what pays for your science.
                    Comprendo?
          
          He places it back in the magnetic field.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Those savages are threatening our whole
                    operation. We're on the brink of war and
                    you're supposed to be finding a
                    diplomatic solution. So use what you've
                    got and get me some results.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
                                                                         17.
          
          
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - DAY
          
          NEXT MORNING, GRACE, NORM and JAKE approach their link units.
          
          Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining
          chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE'S AVATAR lies on a gurney,
          breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM'S AVATAR is on a
          second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks.
          
          Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric
          sensors.
          
                              GRACE
                    How much link time have you logged?
          
                              NORM
                    Five hundred and twenty hours.
          
          Grace looks pointedly at Jake.
          
                              JAKE
                    Like -- an hour.
          
                              GRACE
                    Tell me you're joking.
          
          Grace opens the hood of Jake's link unit. Jake starts
          hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to
          help him but --
          
                               JAKE
                    Don't!   I got this.
          
          Grace steps back, hands raised.    He drags himself into the
          unit.
          
                               GRACE
                    So you just figured you'd come out here
                    to the most hostile environment known to
                    man, with no training of any kind, and
                    see how it went? What was going through
                    your head?
          
          He meets her eyes with a defiant glare.
          
                              JAKE
                    Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling
                    me what I couldn't do.
          
          Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the
          link chair by hand.
          
                                                                       18.
          
          
          
          Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit.
          It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors,
          then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL --
          
                              GRACE
                    Relax and let your mind go blank.    That
                    shouldn't be hard for you.
          
                              JAKE
                    Kiss the darkest part of my lily white --
          
          But the SLAMMING HOOD muffles the rest.

          The LINK TECH touches some controls.
          
          ON A LARGE MONITOR a 3D SCAN of Jake's brain appears.
          Regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors.
          
                              MAX
                    That's a gorgeous brain.     Nice activity.
          
                               GRACE
                    Go figure.
                        (walking away)
                    Alright, I'm going in.

          Max watches a display showing the avatar's nervous system
          aligning with Jake's -- two ghostly networks of light
          merging.
          
                                 MAX
                    That's it.     Find your way home.
          
          ECU JAKE, inside the link unit. His eyes move under the
          lids, like a dreamer in REM sleep as --
          
          INSIDE JAKE'S MIND -- radiant streamers coalesce into a
          pulsing TUNNEL OF LIGHT and --
          
          THE SCREEN FLARES WHITE -- ZZZWHAP! -- resolving into an
          overexposed, out-of-focus image -- two BLURRY FACES wearing
          masks, looking down.
          
          ECU JAKE'S AVATAR -- two very intense eyes FILL FRAME, the
          pupils contracting. Golden irises pulse with life.
          
                                                                       19.

                    Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link
                    is stable.
          
          Blinking, Jake slowly sits up on the gurney. He looks down
          at his AVATAR BODY, touching his chest with one hand.
          
                              MAX
                    Take it slow, Jake. We need to check
                    your motor control. Try touching your
                    fingertips together --
          
          But Jake isn't listening. He's staring at his legs.     He
          eases them off the gurney and --
          
          HIS BLUE FEET touch the concrete floor, taking his weight.
          
          JAKE STANDS, feeling the strength in his legs.    His
          expression is child-like with wonder.
          
          HIS POV -- looking down at the med techs, who seem the size
          of children next to his 9' tall frame.
          
          He sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm
          and he JERKS AROUND in alarm. HIS TAIL.
          
          As he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a
          table with a crash. Jake laughs and grins at Max.
          
                              MED TECH
                    Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down --
          
          But Jake takes a step, then another. The wires to the bio-
          monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest.
          
                              MAX
                    Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests --
          
          But Jake pushes past the protesting med techs, toward the
          door and --
          
          EXT. AVATAR COMPOUND - DAY
          
          Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself
          in the AVATAR COMPOUND -- a living and training area.
          
          Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front
          of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about
          their daily activities around the compound.
          
                                                                       20.
          
          
          
          Jake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little
          unsteadily, but his expression is joyful.
          
          He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are
          calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's
          running. RUNNING!
          
          He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid
          neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling
          his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling
          in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He
          looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world.
          
                              GRACE (O.S.)
                    Hey Marine!
          
          Jake turns at the familiar voice to see --
          
          A statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE
          is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach
          and firm athlete's breasts. She wears shorts and a T-shirt.
          In human years she would be about 35.
          
                                JAKE
                    Grace?
          
                              GRACE
                    Well who'd you expect, numbnuts?   Think
                    fast!
          
          She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches.
          
                              GRACE
                    Motor control is looking good.
          
          Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin.
          
                              NORM (O.S.)
                    Hey, check it out.
          
          Jake turns to see NORM'S AVATAR posing like a bodybuilder --
          chest shot, back shot, bi's.
          
                              NORM
                    I am a living god.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. MINE PIT - DAY
          
          A WIDE SHOT of the terraced crater of the UNOBTANIUM MINE.    A
          quiet beat, then --
          
                                                                     21.
          
          
          
          K-WHOOOOM! The entire face of one terrace is blown skyward
          in a chain of EXPLOSIONS. The "shot" blasts hundreds of tons
          of rock loose.
          
          LONG LENS ANGLES of enormous WHEEL-LOADERS shovelling up ore-
          rich rock and dropping it into DUMP TRUCKS.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          A wall of steel FILLS FRAME. The DOZER BLADE crushes
          everything in its path, reducing trees to kindling.
          
          WIDER, showing the CLEAR-CUTTING operation near the mine, as
          a road is cut through the jungle. Remotely operated DOZERS
          three stories tall rip into the tree-line.
          
          One of the dozers has rotating SLASH-CUTTER, a vicious
          spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through
          the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood-shrapnel.
          
          The heavy machines are escorted by AMPSUITS. COLONEL
          QUARITCH, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing
          breathing masks and carrying almighty big AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
          
          A BANSHEE -- a fearsome aerial predator -- HURTLES from
          above, diving toward them on wings 3 meters across. We get a
          glimpse of glassy fangs before --
          
          P-P-POOM! Quaritch cranks off three rapid SHOTS with his
          massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a SHRIEK.
          
          It crashes near them and Quaritch FIRES two more well placed
          rounds. The newbies stare at the thing's barracuda teeth.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    For you pogues, this is a banshee. A
                    small one. See, they like it when I
                    bring fresh meat out here. And this
                    clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's
                    nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If
                    it moves, shoot it. If you're not sure
                    it's moving -- shoot it! If it looks like
                    a bunch of flowers you want to take home
                    to Sally Rottencrotch -- SHOOT IT!
                    What're you gonna do?
          
                              TROOPERS
                    Shoot it, sir!
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Outstanding. Let's roll.
          
                                                                      22.
          
          
          
          Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his
          eyes scanning. Flanking the squad, LYLE WAINFLEET drives an
          AMPSUIT, his massive feet CRASHING through the underbrush.
          
          As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the
          trail -- an intricate TOTEM of woven sticks, bones and
          feathers hanging across the trail like an orb-weaver's web.
          
          He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it
          into the mud as he moves on.
          
          INT. AVATAR LONGHOUSE - DUSK
          
          Jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropical-style
          construction -- beamed ceiling, open sides covered by screen.
          
          Around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night,
          pulling insect netting around their cots. In one hand, Jake
          holds the end of his long braided QUEUE of hair.
          
          CLOSE ON the queue -- the ends of the hair writhe slowly with
          their own life, like tendrils of a sea creature.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's kinda freaky.
          
          GRACE switches off the overheads.
          
                              GRACE
                    Lights out amigos.     See ya' at dinner.
          
          Jake sits in the twilight, listening to the SCREECHES and
          HOOTS from the forest. Finally he lies down, CLOSING HIS
          EYES and --
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - NIGHT
          
          ECU HUMAN JAKE -- his eyes OPEN.
          
          Jake blinks, disoriented, as Max opens the upper clamshell of
          his link unit.
          
          In the next chair Grace sits up, yawning and cracking her
          neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette.
          
                              GRACE
                        (looking down)
                    Damn. Same old sack a' bones.
          
          JAKE struggles with the dead weight of his legs as he hauls
          himself out of the unit.
                                                                   CUT TO

          INT. COMMISSARY - EARLY MORNING
          
          JAKE sits with GRACE, NORM and the other avatar "drivers",
          while around them miners, troopers and other base personnel
          wolf their breakfasts. Grace is engaged in a heated
          conversation with another SCIENTIST.
          
          Jake, isolated from the conversations around him, notices --
          
          PILOT TRUDY CHACON approaching, dressed in her flight suit.
          She's a rock-hard former Marine with thousands of flight
          hours out in the badlands.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in the
                    Armor Bay.
          
          Jake gives Norm a puzzled glance and pivots from the table.
          He wheels away, led by Trudy.
          
          TIGHT ON GRACE, scowling as she watches him go.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY - MORNING
          
          JAKE AND TRUDY enter the ARMOR BAY, passing TILT-ROTORS under
          repair. There are the heavily armed SCORPIONS as well as
          several SA-2 SAMSON work-horses outfitted with door guns and
          rocket pods.
          
                              JAKE
                    You guys're packing some heavy ordinance.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Yeah, `cause we're not the only thing
                    flyin' around out there. Or the biggest.
                    I'm gonna need you on a door gun, I'm a
                    man short.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah, no problem.
          
          She extends her fist and he taps it with his.
          
                              TRUDY
                    See ya on the flight-line, zero nine.
                        (she points)
                    He's down there.
          
          Jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the Armor
          Bay, passing rows of AMPSUITS standing in service racks.
          Techs clamber over the `suits, loading ordinance with cranes
          and lifts.
          
                                                                      24.
          
          
          
          At the end of the row is a makeshift GYM area.   QUARITCH is
          bench-pressing massive plates.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    This low gravity makes you soft.
                        (pushing the last rep)
                    You get soft, Pandora will shit you out
                    dead with zero warning.
          
          Quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela
                    -- that was some mean bush. Nothing like
                    this here, though. You got heart kid,
                    coming out here.
          
                              JAKE
                    I figured -- just another hellhole.
          
          Quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder.
          The CHIEF MECHANIC yells from the nearest AMPSUIT --
          
                              MECHANIC
                    That servo's in, Colonel, if you want to
                    try it.
          
          Quaritch crosses to the `suit, with Jake following.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I was in First Recon a few years ahead of
                    you. More than a few. Two tours in
                    Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here
                    and --
          
          He points to his scarred face.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    They could fix this if I rotated back.
                    But you know what? I kinda like it.
                    Reminds me every day what's out there.
                    Besides, I can't leave --
          
          He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree-
          line.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    This is my war, here.
          
          Quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit,
          throwing some switches. The `suit's gas-turbine spools up
          with a rising WHINE.
          
                                                                       25.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    The avatar program is a joke -- buncha
                    limpdick scientists. But we have a
                    unique opportunity here, you and I. A
                    recon Marine in an avatar body could get
                    me the intel I need, on the ground, right
                    in the hostiles' camp.
          
          The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the `suit trembles with
          power. The air boils above the exhaust vents.
          
          Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one
          huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic --
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Looks good.
                        (to Jake)
                    I need you to learn about these savages,
                    gain their trust. Find out how I can
                    force their cooperation, or hit `em hard
                    if they don't. Maybe you can keep some
                    of my boys from going home like you. Or
                    bagged-and-tagged.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NODDING)
                    That sounds real good, Colonel.   So -- am
                    I still with Augustine?
          
                              QUARITCH
                    On paper. You walk like one of her
                    science pukes, you quack like one, but
                    you report to me. Can you do that for
                    me?
          
          Jake nods. Quaritch brings the `suit to life. He steps
          forward and pivots smoothly.
          
          He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping
          the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing
          a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control.
          He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind
          of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get
                    me what I need, I'll see you get your
                    legs back when you rotate home. Your real
                    legs.
          
          He raises the `suit's hand, and slams the canopy shut like
          the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge
          feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG!
          
                                                                      26.
          
          
          
          INT. BIO LAB - DAY
          
          GRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their
          FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX.
          
                              GRACE
                    Start calibrating. We're on the flight
                    line in ten minutes.
          
          Max nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM
          fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR.
          
                              GRACE
                    What did Atilla want?
          
                              JAKE
                    Just Marines comparin' tattoos.
          
                              GRACE
                        (not buying it)
                    Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --
          
          She stops, turning to drill him with a look.
          
                              GRACE
                    -- you're driving an avatar, now.     That
                    means you're in my world, got it?
          
                               JAKE
                    Got it.
          
          She turns and enters the LINK ROOM.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          Grace crosses to the controls of Jake's LINK UNIT. As the
          others catch up --
          
                              GRACE
                    That son of a bitch has screwed up this
                    program enough. All this --
                        (indicating link room)
                    -- exists so we can go out there and
                    build a bridge of trust to these people,
                    who could teach us so much. But thanks
                    to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't
                    even talk to us anymore.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then how's this supposed to work?
          
                                                                     27.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    We have a new face.
                        (turning to Norm)
                    You're fluent, you've studied the
                    culture. You're non-threatening. The
                    ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan --
                    may give you a chance. Maybe you can get
                    them back to the table before things go
                    tits-up for good.
          
                              NORM
                    This is failing as a pep talk.
          
          Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link.
          
                              JAKE
                    How do we contact them?
          
                              GRACE
                    We don't. They contact us. If they see
                    us taking our samples, treating the
                    forest with respect --
                        (pointedly to Jake)
                    Not trampling everything in sight --
                    they may reach out to us.
          
                              JAKE
                    Or they may skin us and make a drum.
          
          Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body.
          
                              GRACE
                    Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do
                    the talking.
          
          She closes his clamshell, HARD, and we --
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAIN FOREST / AERIAL - DAY
          
          FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and
          cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY'S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its
          shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is
          tiny in the vast primeval landscape.
          
          ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper
          WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun,
          scanning for aerial predators.
          
          In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest
          unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes.
          Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids.
          
                                                                       28.
          
          
          
          TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a
          shallow river.
          
                              TRUDY (INTERCOM)
                    Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock.
          
          Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see--
          A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures
          reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river.
          
                               GRACE
                    Looks like a bull, six cows and some
                    juveniles.
          
                              NORM
                    The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?
          
          Grace nods approvingly.
          
          TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight
          from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water
          above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS.
          
          TIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a
          WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling
          in on the gorge below like it's a gun-run.
          
          Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he's about to puke.
          
                                 WAINFLEET
                    Yo Chacon!     Get some!
          
          Jake grins into the airstream.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. CLEARING - DAY
          
          A small meadow among towering trees. The fern-like "grass"
          is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson
          settles to the ground.
          
          Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and
          hefts it like an assault rifle.
          
          He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree-
          line warily, weapons aimed.
          
          Grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning Trudy to shut
          down. Trudy kills the Samson's TURBINES.
          
          Grace, towering over Wainfleet, motions him to hang back.
          
                                                                    29.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Stay with the ship.
                        (for Jake)
                    One idiot with a gun's enough.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Whatever you say, Doc.
          
          Jake takes point as they enter the jungle.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Ya'll have fun out there.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          The forest engulfs JAKE, GRACE and NORM in cyan gloom. The
          shadows are alive with the CHITTERING sounds of unseen alien
          wildlife.
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE as he moves through the foliage, hyper-
          alert -- looking around like a tourist in Hell.A monkey-like
          PROLEMURIS leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing
          through the sunlight streaming down in shafts.
          
          A PLANT with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he
          passes.
          
          This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that
          react and move like animals. Jake white-knuckles his rifle
          as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death.
          
                              GRACE
                    Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.
          
          She pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower
          his muzzle as he follows her. Grace moves nimbly on the
          path, seemingly unconcerned.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. FOREST/ GLEN
          
          WIDE SHOT as the party moves between the huge trees, tiny as
          ants. The trail has gotten steeper, the going tougher.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SCHOOL RUINS - DAY
          
          They enter a clearing with an OVERGROWN BUILDING made of
          timbers cut from the local trees, with a thatch roof. It is
          covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it.
          
                                                                     30.
          
          
          
                              NORM
                    How will they know we're here?
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm sure they're watching us right now.
          
          Norm gulps. Jake looks behind him as they approach the
          school, feeling unseen eyes.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. SCHOOL RUINS
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE'S BOOTS as he steps among dried leaves and
          a few moldering CHILDREN'S BOOKS. Floorboards CREAK.
          
                              GRACE (O.S.)
                    The kids were so bright, so eager to
                    learn... they picked up English faster
                    than I could teach it to them.
          
          WIDER as Jake explores the room. Grace and Norm are selecting
          INSTRUMENTS from storage cases on a wooden table.
          
                              GRACE
                    Bring the soil probe -- right there,
                    yellow case.
          
          Jake looks up at a RUSTLING among the dark rafters. Roosting
          STINGBATS eye him warily, fluttering their wings.
          
          Grace picks up a moldering copy of "The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss
          from the floor and puts it back on a shelf.
          
                               GRACE
                        (WISTFULLY)
                    The stingbats knock them off. I guess I
                    always hope somebody will come back and
                    read them.
          
                              NORM
                    Why don't they come back?
          
                              GRACE
                        (GRIMLY)
                    The Na'vi learned as much about us as
                    they needed to know.
          
          Jake sees something, and approaches the blackboard -- reaches
          out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate.
          Unmistakably BULLET HOLES.
          
                                                                       31.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                        (turning to her)
                    What happened here?
          
                              GRACE
                        (SHARPLY)
                    Are you going to help with this gear?
                    We've got a lot to do.
          
          She turns away.   Jake watches her as he jams equipment into
          his pack.
                                                                     CUT TO:

          CLOSE ON Grace's blue hand gently brushing away soil,
          exposing a tangle of ROOT TENDRILS.
          
                              GRACE
                    See, right here where the roots of the
                    two trees interact.
          
          WIDER -- GRACE and NORM crouch among enormous octopoidal
          roots. She takes a tiny sample using a needle-like probe.
          Norm uses a digital DEVICE to scan the roots.
          
          JAKE, bored, scouts ahead a few meters.
          
          He comes to a GLADE filled with shoulder-high SPIRAL PLANTS
          called HELICORADIANS.
          
          He BRUSHES one and SHTOONK! -- it SUCKS DOWN into a tube in
          the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish.
          
          Curious, Jake touches another -- SHTOONK! And another --
          like popping balloons after a party. SHTOONK! SHTOONK!
          SHTOONK!
          
          A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into
          the ground, REVEALING --
          
          A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but
          twice that size. Its massive, low-slung head has projections
          of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark.
          
          Its baleful eyes lock onto him.   Jake raises his rifle.
          
          Grace, alerted by the creature's SNORTS, runs to where she
          can see the tableau. She presses her THROAT MIKE.
          
                              GRACE
                    Don't shoot. You'll piss it off.
          
                                                                       32.
          
          
          
          The bull HAMMERHEAD bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide
          sledgehammer of a skull.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's already pissed off!
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.
          
          Jake starts to back away.   The hammerhead bellows again,
          pawing the earth.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's a territorial threat display. Do not
                    run, or he'll charge.
          
                              JAKE
                    What do I do?
          
                              GRACE
                    Hold your ground!
          
          The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering
          saplings. It bellows again, lowers its head and CHARGES --
          
          Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide
          and runs straight at the thing.
          
          It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT.
          
          ON JAKE -- amazed the gambit worked.
          
                               JAKE
                    Oh yeah!   Who's bad?! That's right.
          
          SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus --
          
          A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has
          ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the
          Alien for desert.
          
          It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored
          head and massive distensible jaws.
          
          JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the
          hammerhead --
          
                              JAKE
                    That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!
          
          The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away
          through splintering undergrowth.
          
                                                                       33.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right motherf--
          
          A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see --
          
          THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing
          between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes.
          
          The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the
          hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face
          Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS.
          
                              JAKE
                    What about this one?       Run, don't run?
                    What?
          
                                 GRACE
                    Run.     Definitely RUN!
          
          Jake BOLTS as --
          
          The thanator LEAPS after him and --
          
          Jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the
          beast to claw its way around to the side while --
          
          Jake scrambles up -- around -- over a tangle of roots and --
          
          SK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off
          a trunk as --
          
          JAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle
          the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but --
          
          JAKE dives under a massive root system, and --
          
          CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the
          root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he
          rolls and crawls --
          
          Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks,
          sending chunks of wood flying. It's spittle sprays across
          Jake, jaws inches away as --
          
          He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the
          rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an
          ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and -- RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK
          away. Jake scrambles to escape but --
          
          GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and --
          
          The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a
          junkyard dog with a rabbit, only --
          
                                                                       34.
          
          
          
          It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and --
          
          He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its
          teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but --
          
          With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him,
          splintering trees.
          
          JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening
          black tornado shreds the forest behind him and --
          
          He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might --
          
          The thanator's jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies
          out into open space and --
          
          JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river.
          
          The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to
          rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon.
          
          Jake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past
          his face amid turbulent bubbles.
          
          A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the
          thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and --
          
          Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract.
          
          EXT. RIVER BELOW FALLS - DAY
          
          The water boils below the cataract. Jake's head bursts
          through the surface, and he gasps for breath.
          
          He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a
          limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just
          lies there gasping on the trunk.
          
          Above him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which
          echoes across the jungle.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          JAKE, wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant
          leaves.   He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with
          his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          TRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like it's a
          minefield, carrying his SPEAR white-knuckled. He is freaked
          and hyper-alert.
          
                                                                        35.
          
          
          
          The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the
          sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the
          cyan gloom.
          
          POV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake
          move warily through the forest.
          
          ECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows.
          
          DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to
          him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA'VI
          GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving.
          
          She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders,
          and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful --
          for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her
          name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).
          
          Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious.
          
          NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement
          she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT
          JAKE. Utterly silent.
          
          Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his
          THROAT.
          
          ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing
          for the shot --
          
          -- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G.    She
          hesitates.
          
          RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single
          WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a
          dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky
          CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It
          glows faintly in the dark shadows.
          
          NEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly.   The
          woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom.
                                                                      CUT TO:

          GRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY
          banks in a search pattern.
          
                              TRUDY (INTERCOM)
                    I'm going to have to call it, guys. We're
                    not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's
                    orders.
          
                                                                        36.
          
          
          
          Grace looks to the west.    The sun setting behind alien trees.
          
                              GRACE
                    Shit.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang
                    on `till morning.
          
                              GRACE
                    He's not going to make it till morning.
          
          Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard,
          thundering away toward the setting sun.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          LONG LENS-- POLYPHEMUS. The giant planet rises behind the
          black trees.
          
          Jake's got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid
          grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by
          a pack of VIPERWOLVES.
          
          Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking
          black movement -- then nothing. Darkness.
          
          TIME CUT -- TIGHT ON Jake's hands as he knots his T-shirt
          around the butt end of the spear.
          
          ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk. Jake jams
          the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it.
          
          A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.
          
          The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing,
          leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the
          trail.
          
          Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES.
          Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black
          SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.
          
          He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead.   Another on
          his opposite flank.
          
          Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.
          
          The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey.
          They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.
          
                                                                       37.
          
          
          
          JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a
          steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it
          on a horizontal trunk --
          
          -- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates
          GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The
          viperwolves have him encircled.
          
          The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each
          other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on
          his legs from behind but --
          
          JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face.   It yips and goes
          past, but ANOTHER moves in --
          
          He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,
          retreating, baring its fangs.
          
          Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees
          what he's up against.   The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with
          shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.
          Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
          
          Jake realizes that he is making his final stand.   He whirls
          the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --
          
          And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a
          lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
          
                              JAKE
                        (SCREAMING)
                    I don't have all goddamn night! Come on!
                    Come on!
          
          With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.
          
          Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --
          
          ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking
          true, but --
          
          Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes
          flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
          
          A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in
          pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --
          
          CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.
          
          JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf
          leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake
          tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --
          
                                                                       38.
          
          
          
          THREE WOLVES charge at once.     The nearest LEAPS at his throat
          just as --
          
          THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.
          
          The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight.    He pushes it
          off in time to see --
          
          A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw
          and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another
          wolf falls.
          
          NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the
          skull of a circling wolf.
          
          ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but
          rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
          
          Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
          
          SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,
          but --
          
          It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its
          throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.
          
          MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT
          across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
          
          The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past
          them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and--
          
          They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    Raaaarrrr!
          
          Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his
          weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it
          and looks up at --
          
          NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening
          to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is
          over, she turns.
          
          She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.
          Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.
          
                              JAKE
                    Wait, don't --
          
                                                                       39.
          
          
          
          Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still
          see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest
          is transformed.
          
          The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and
          patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.
          
          Jake scrambles to recover his spear.   Neytiri kneels beside --
          
          A DYING WOLF. It's CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,
          trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its
          chest.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (in Na'vi)
                    Forgive me, my brother.
          
          She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches
          its head gently, regarding it with sadness.
          
          Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her
          waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling
          the arrow from its heart.
          
                              JAKE
                    Look, um, I know you probably don't
                    understand this. But -- thanks. Thank
                    you. I owe you.
          
          Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead
          animal.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (in Na'vi)
                    Forgive me. May your spirit run with the
                    Great Mother.
          
                              JAKE
                    I would have been screwed if you hadn't
                    come along --
          
          She rises and walks away without looking at Jake.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'?
          
          He crashes through some plants, catching up to her.
          
                              JAKE
                    Slow down a second will you. I just want
                    to thank you for killing those --
          
          He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --
          
                                                                     40.
          
          
          
          WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a
          fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.
          
          He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who
          speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Don't thank! You don't thank for this!
                    This is sad. Very sad, only.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm
                    sorry.
          
          She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    All this is your fault! They did not need
                    to die.
          
                              JAKE
                    They attacked me.   How'm I the bad guy
                    HERE--
          
          She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Your fault! You are like a baby, making
                    noise, don't know what to do. You should
                    not come here, all of you! You only come
                    and make problems. Only.
          
          Jake gets up, slowly, facing her.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, fine, you love your little forest
                    friends. So why not just let them kill
                    my ass? What's the thinking?
          
          CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes
          MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big
          gold orbs.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Why save you?
          
                              JAKE
                    Yes, why save me?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You have a strong heart.   No fear.
          
          She leans closer --
          
                                                                       41.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    But stupid! Ignorant like a child!
          
          She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her.
          
          TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT.
          
          WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which
          forms an elevated walkway.
          
          Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far
          above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move
          through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.
          
                              JAKE
                    If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should
                    teach me.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Sky people can not learn.   You do not
                    See.
          
          She leaps to another elevated root.   Jake follows, surprised
          that he made it.
          
                               JAKE
                    Whooaa.
          
          He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then teach me to "see."
          
          She stops and he almost runs into her.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    No one can teach you to See.
          
          Then she turns and trots on.
          
          EXT. GORGE - NIGHT
          
          They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a
          horizontal trunk big as an oak.
          
          WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers
          silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred
          feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other
          night flyers.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just
                    got off on the wrong foot and --
          
                                                                       42.
          
          
          
          Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height.
          
                              JAKE
                    --you just have to get to know me. I'm
                    Jake. Jake Sull--
          
          A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance.   He drops
          the spear and almost falls off the root.
          
                              JAKE
                    Whooaaa -- shit!
          
          Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He
          watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.
          
          She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE
                    I need your help.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You should not be here.
          
                              JAKE
                    So take me with you.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    No. You go back.
          
          DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down
          through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently
          toward Jake and Neytiri.
          
          NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --
          
          The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards
          Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head.
          
                              JAKE
                        (off her amazed look)
                    What?
          
          More woodsprites gather around him.   Several ALIGHT on him.
          
          Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow
          he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing
          all over his arms, hands, body.
          
                              JAKE
                    What are they?
          
          CU NEYTIRI -- reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread.
          
                                                                       43.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree --
                    very pure spirits.
          
          Jake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT --
          moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He
          studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until --
          
          -- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering
          into the darkness.
          
                              JAKE
                    What was that all about?
          
          Neytiri seems shaken.   She seizes his hand and pulls him
          after her.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Come!
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder.
          He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence
          shiver through them.
          
          Jake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which
          reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green
          light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each
          footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch
          down. Dream-like, surreal beauty.
          
          WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror-
          like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL.
          
          Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's your name?
          
          JAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at
          him, spinning end for end and --
          
          SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs.   He topples off the root
          and crashes into the foliage below.
          
          JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --
          
          SEVERAL NA'VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding
          DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales.
          
                                                                       44.
          
          
          We see that the riders' QUEUES are connected to the horses'
          long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can
          command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons.
          
          The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake
          turns to bolt, but --
          
          NA'VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed --
          blocking his retreat.
          
          Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the
          LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Na'vi --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Tsu'tey, what are you doing?! He is my
                    captive!
          
          TSU'TEY(tsu-Tay)is young and powerfully built, with sculpted
          features and a proud jawline, piercing eyes. Tsu'tey swings
          off his mount with fluid grace.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These demons are forbidden here. I will
                    kill this one as a lesson to the others!
          
          Tsu'tey draws his bow but Neytiri leaps between him and Jake,
          confronting him warrior to warrior.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Stop! There has been a sign. This is a
                    matter for the Tsahik.
          
          Tsu'tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with
          her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts
          his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bring him.
          
          They grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears
          and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsu'tey
          and the others ride ahead.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiri's village, which is
          sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250
          meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the
          largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.
          
                                                                      45.
          
          
          
          TSU'TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree,
          shouting an ululating WARNING.
          
          Jake is force-marched through the pillars into --
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the
          arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe --
          mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
          
          They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to
          outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow
          him.
          
          Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light
          of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical
          gallery -- a living cathedral.
          
          Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with
          fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.
          
          The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous
          creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM.
          Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is --
          
          EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply
          chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS.
          His normally stern features are clouded further by anger.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Why do you bring this creature here?
          
          Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na'vi.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I was going to kill him, but there was a
                    sign from Eywa.
          
          He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I have said no dreamwalker will come
                    here, to offend our home! His alien
                    smell fills my nose
          
          Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not
          submissive tone.
          
                                                                       46.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Father, many atokirina came to this
                    alien.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's going on?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    My father is deciding whether to kill
                    you.
          
                              JAKE
                    Your father!?
                        (to Eytukan)
                    Uh, good to meet you, sir.
          
          Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP
          to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as --
          
          A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber.
          
                               MO'AT
                        (NA'VI)
                    Step back!
          
          Everybody looks up.
          
          MO'AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down.
          She is a severe woman in her 50's. Her bearing is haughty,
          her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is
          elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I will look at this alien.
          
          There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core
          of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one
                    who interprets the will of Eywa.
          
                              JAKE
                    Who's Eywa?
          
          Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo'at passes.
          
          The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly
          around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue.
          
                                                                     47.
          
          
          
                              MO'AT
                        (thick accent)
                    What are you called?
          
                              JAKE
                    Jake Sully.
          
          She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a
          flourish she strikes his chest.
          
          Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some
          between her fingertips. She tastes it.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Why did you come to us?
          
                              JAKE
                    I came to learn.
          
                              MO'AT
                    We have tried to teach other Sky People.
                    It is hard to fill a cup which is already
                    full.
          
                              JAKE
                    My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask
                    Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist.
          
                              MO'AT
                    What are you?
          
                              JAKE
                    I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a
                    warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    A warrior! I could kill him easily!
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    No! This is the first warrior
                    dreamwalker we have seen. We need to
                    learn more about him.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's going on?   What are they saying?
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Neytiri, subtitled)
                    Daughter. You will teach him our way, to
                    speak and walk as we do.
          
                                                                     48.
          
          
          
          NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Why me? That's not fair!     I only--
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    It is decided!
          
          Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Jake)
                    My daughter will teach you our ways.
                    Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if
                    your insanity can be cured.
          
          She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern --
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    He is your responsibility.
          
          Neytiri nods, accepting, but she's not a happy camper.   She
          grabs Jake's arm and pulls him roughly away.
          
                              JAKE
                    So it's all good, right?   You and me --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Do not speak.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. SECOND LEVEL/HOMETREE
          
          LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL.
          He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound
          with plant-fiber bandages.
          
          THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They
          stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the
          circle.
          
                              JAKE
                    Don't get up.
          
          Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with
          several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to
          Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY.
          
                              JAKE
                    You never told me your name.
          
                                                                       49.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, again, a whole lot slower.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (exaggerated slowness)
                    Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.
          
          Jake knows she's baiting him.   He smiles in response.
          
                              JAKE
                    Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.
          
          ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu'tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together,
          glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These aliens try to look like people, but
                    they can't.

                    He seems dim to me.   And his eyes are too
                    small.
          
          NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving
          leaves onto his own leaf.
          
                              JAKE
                    Your mom likes me.    I can tell.
          
          MO'AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan.

                    Neytiri will test this "warrior." Hey may
                    learn nothing -- but we will learn much.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                    You speak truth. We must understand
                    these Sky People if we are to drive them
                    out.
          
          Jake munches on a white shrimp-like thing.
          
                              JAKE
                    These rock. What are they?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Teylu. You call beetle larvae.
          
                                                                       50.
          
          
          
          Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a
          CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and
          starts munching enthusiastically.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's some damn fine teylu. That's like
                    grandma's teylu.

          The sleeping level -- families nesting in groups on woven
          hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along
          SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the tree's outer shell.
          
          Jake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness
          around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl.
          She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes.
          
          Jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night-
          light, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads
          through him. He closes his eyes and --
                                                                  CUT TO:

          He looks around, blinking.   Reality crashing in.
          
                              GRACE
                    Damn, you were dug in like a tick.

                    Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to
                    believe where I am.

                    -- so the kid's out there one night and
                    he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering
                    him the spare room and the car keys.
                    Unbelievable.

                    It's not something you can teach.
          
          Some of the other scientists clap Jake on the shoulders in
          congratulation.

                    That's awesome, Jake.

          JAKE has reported to SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH. Quaritch turns
          from gazing out at the wall of forest, displaying a feral
          grin.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Jarhead clan?
                        (he laughs)
                    And that worked?
          
                              JAKE
                        (GRINNING)
                    Yeah. They want to study me.   See if I
                    can learn to be one of them.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    That's how you seize the initiative. I
                    wish I had ten more like you.

                              SELFRIDGE (cont'd)
                    We try to give them medicine and
                    education. Roads! But no -- they like
                    mud. I wouldn't care except --
          
          Selfridge turns to a large 3D GRAPHIC DISPLAY, pointing. A
          road runs from Hell's Gate to a proposed new mine miles away.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Their damn village is sitting right over
                    the richest unobtanium deposit for a
                    hundred klicks in any direction. Which
                    sucks -- for them -- because they need to
                    relocate.

                    Does Augustine know about this?
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Yeah, she does, and she's on the next
                    ship back if she tries to cock-block me
                    on it.
          
                              JAKE

                    What if they won't go?
          
                              QUARITCH
                        (ICY)
                    I'm betting they will.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Killing the indigenous looks bad, but
                    there's one thing shareholders hate more
                    than bad press -- and that's a bad
                    quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to
                    get them to move, or it's going to have
                    to be all stick.
          
          Jake is shaken by the enormity of this new responsibility.

                    Who's Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The
                    Great Mother. The goddess made up of all
                    living things. You'd know that if you
                    had any training whatsoever.

          As Jake settles into the soft embrace of the link, Grace
          inputs commands at the control station.

          HOMETREE, like a gothic cathedral overhead.   Sunlight streams
          down through gaps in the towering vault.

          JAKE walks among the villagers, who go about their daily
          tasks.
          
          -- young girls sit together, weaving and SINGING.    They look
          up as he passes, then go back to work.
          
          --two men clean the fish they've caught.
          
          -- a young mother pounds seeds into meal, while nursing an
          infant.
          
          --children chase each other and climb like monkeys. One bold
          LITTLE GIRL runs up to Jake, stops -- staring -- then shrieks
          with laughter as she runs back to her playmates.
          
          GRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a
          DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old sway-backed
          MARE. His grin drops.
          
          EXT. RIVER NEAR HOMETREE - DAY
          
          JAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds
          its nose-ring while Jake clumsily mounts.
          
          Jake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue.
          He hesitantly touches them together and --
          
                                                                       55.
          
          
          
          TIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE.
          
          Jake's PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horse's
          eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her
          fingertips to the neural interface.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her
                    heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong
                    legs.
          
          Jake closes his eyes, nodding.   One with the horse.
          
          TSU'TEY and another young hunter come out of the forest
          leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from
          the edge of the pool. Tsu'tey watches Jake's riding lesson
          with disdain.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You may tell her what to do --
                        (she touches her head)
                    -- inside. For now, say where to go.
          
                               JAKE
                    Forward.
          
          The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no
          idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He
          lands painfully in the mud.
          
          He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads
          the horse back to him.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Again.
          
          SERIES OF JUMP CUTS -- Jake falls off the horse in various
          ways, seemingly landing harder each time.
          
          ON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully
          rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees --
          
          TSU'TEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow
          river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their
          hooves.
          
          Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu'tey stops his horse next
          to him, looking down with disdain.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    You should go away.
          
                                                                       56.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Neytiri)
                    I knew this guy could speak English.
          
          Tsu'tey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    This alien will learn nothing.   A rock
                    Sees more.
          
          She sighs in agreement. Tsu'tey and the other hunter wheel
          their horses around and THUNDER OFF into the woods.
          
          NEYTIRI gestures to Jake's horse.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Again.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          OPS CENTER - NIGHT
          
          Grouped around a table are JAKE, COLONEL QUARITCH, SELFRIDGE
          and few ENGINEERS and OFFICERS. Jake is talking them through
          plans he's made of Hometree's inner structure.
          
                              JAKE
                    You've got outer columns, then a
                    secondary ring here, and an inner ring.
                    Then a core structure, it's like a
                    spiral, that's how they move up and down.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I'm going to need accurate scans of all
                    these columns.
          
                              JAKE
                    Roger that.
          
          ANGLE ON MAX, at the stairwell. He's been watching Jake
          talking rapidly to Quaritch, but can't hear him. Frowning,
          he backs away, down the stairs.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          JAKE, GRACE and NORM are packing science gear and supplies.
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm not about to let Quaritch and
                    Selfridge micro-manage this thing.
                        (she looks pointedly at Jake)
                    We're going up into the mountains.

                    There's a mobile link up at Site 26 that
                    we can work out of.
          
                              NORM
                    The Hallelujah Mountains?
          
                              GRACE
                    That's right.
          
                              NORM
                    Yesssss!
                        (off Jake's look)
                    The legendary Floating Mountains of
                    Pandora? Heard of them?
                                                                 CUT TO:

          A SAMSON THUNDERS over the rainforest, climbing into the mist-
          shrouded mountains.
          
          In the SEALED COCKPIT, Norm is up front, sitting left seat so
          Trudy can talk him through the flight controls. Jake and
          Grace are behind them, in the jump-seats.
          
          Grace and Norm's UNCONSCIOUS AVATARS ride in the open back
          compartment.
          
                              TRUDY
                    It only takes tiny inputs.   Here, put
                    your hand on the cyclic --
          
          She points to the stick between her knees. Norm hesitantly
          reaches over and rests his hand on hers.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Feel how small the moves are? You barely
                    have to think it, and the aircraft
                    reacts.
          
          ON NORM -- reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady-pilot.
          
          THE SAMSON is dwarfed by enormous ARCHES OF ROCK.
          
                              GRACE
                    See these magnetic formations.   We're
                    getting close.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.
          
          On the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out.
          
                                                                       58.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Yup. We're in the flux vortex.
          
          AHEAD, a cloud bank parts, revealing --
          
          THE HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.   Right in front of them.
          
                              NORM
                    Oh. My. God.
          
          Jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out
          the front canopy.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- enormous islands of rock are hovering a half
          mile above the ground. They are overgrown with rainforest,
          and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them.
          Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at
          the bottom.
          
          ON JAKE, staring in amazement.   It is both awe-inspiring and
          disturbing.
          
          Trudy turns, grinning at Jake.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You should see your face.
          
          WIDE AERIAL -- the Samson is tiny as it approaches the
          floating islands of rock. An archipelago among the clouds,
          they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace
                    explained it to me -- some kind of maglev
                    effect because unobtanium is a
                    superconductor, or something. At least
                    somebody understands it. Just not me.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          A remote RESEARCH STATION -- TWO SHACKS and a few clusters of
          instruments perched on a promontory near the Hallelujah
          Mountains. The shacks are AIRLIFT MODULES the size of buses.
          
          THE SAMSON LANDS, beating the grass with its rotor-wash. The
          humans hop out, wearing MASKS.
          
          They move toward the Shack, taking in the spectacular
          panorama.

          NORM and TRUDY assist JAKE with his chair as they cycle in
          through the AIRLOCK. GRACE is already inside, starting the
          GENNY. She turns on the lights and equipment.
          
          There are 4 bunks, a clutter of science gear, and -- through
          a short connecting corridor -- THREE LINK UNITS in the second
          module.
          
          As Grace powers up the Link equipment, Jake stops to look at
          STEREO STILL PICTURES which are taped and tacked up around
          her workstation.
          
          CLOSE ON PICTURES -- Grace posing at the school with various
          grinning children. There is one of her with two lanky girls,
          a younger Neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, take number two, it's the least
                    glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate
                    Jake's link.
          
          Norm glares at Jake as he passes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey. You got a problem?
          
          Norm turns to Grace, his frustration boiling over.
          
                              NORM
                    I trained three years for this mission.
                    I speak the language fluently.
                        (he points at Jake)
                    He falls off the frickin' turnip truck
                    and all of a sudden he's cultural
                    ambassador!?
          
                              GRACE
                    It's not our choice, Norm.
          
          He glowers at Jake.
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah, well I didn't come out here to wash
                    the dishes while you're on some
                    interspecies booty call.
          
          He stalks off.
          
                              GRACE
                    He can't go far.

          She points to Jake's link.
          
                              GRACE
                    Let's get you in.

          INT./EXT. HOMETREE - BANSHEE EYRIE
          
          LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the
          ground. Villagers are ant-like.
          
          Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core
          trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out
          of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --
          
          A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see
          other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like
          enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.
          
          NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of
          STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES
          clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.
          
          Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the
          shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.
          
          A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest
          banshees, this thing is taller than a Na'vi with a 10 meter
          wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it
          alights on the branch right in front of her.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Holy shit.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Do not look in her eye.
          
          Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and
          gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.
          
          It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the
          shadows nearby answer.
          
          Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the
          Banshee's ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the
          neural connection is made.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
                    made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
                    in the whole life.
          
          She climbs smoothly onto the animal's back.
          
                                                                       61.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must
                    choose your own ikran. And he must choose
                    you.
          
                                 JAKE
                    When?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When you are ready.
          
          The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    Heeyaaahh!
          
          Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee
          DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest
          canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a
          power climb.
          
          Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close
          SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.
          
          ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount,
          the rainforest rolling beneath her.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT/EXT
          
          STEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the
          camera. He looks tired.
          
                              JAKE
                    Do I have to do this?   I need some rack.
          
          GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling.
          
                              GRACE
                    No -- now, when it's fresh.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah, yeah.
                        (to camera)
                    The days are starting to blur together.
                    The language is a bitch, but I figure
                    it's like field-stripping a weapon.
                    Repetition.
          
          THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:
          
          JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri
          touches her lips with her fingertips.
          
                                                                       62.
          
          
          
                                 JAKE
                    Seyri.
          
          She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence.
          
                              JAKE
                    Ontu, mikyun, nari.
          
          NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he
          draws a longbow.
          
          BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the
          elbow, repositioning him roughly.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard.
          
          HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --
          
          TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm's bunk. Norm blushes
          and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Norm's attitude has improved lately.
          
          NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen.
          
                                 NORM
                    Thank you?
          
                                 JAKE
                    Ireiyo.
          
          Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.
          
                              NORM
                    Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.   You've gotta roll
                    the R, r-r-r-oll it.
          
          Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's good he's back on board, but he
                    thinks I'm a retard too.
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE'S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto
          a thick root, running on across the rough bark.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    My feet are getting tougher.   I can run
                    farther every day.
          
                                                                       63.
          
          
          
          Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are
          running 30 meters above the ground.
          
          He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.
          She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I have to trust my body to know what to
                    do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die.
          
          Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --
          
          She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows
          its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and
          catches another.
          
          JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with
          him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic
          rush.
          
          He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a
          game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive.
          
          Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.   That he lived.
          
          TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at
          the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.
          
          IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO'AT. The
          Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.
          Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and
                    Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes
                    me coffee before link every morning.
          
          Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward
          moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of
          greeting.
          
                              GRACE
                        (Na'vi, subtitled)
                    I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out
          the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the
          plants around her, and sniffs the air.
          
                                                                      64.
          
          
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I'm learning to read the trails, the
                    tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest
                    scents and sounds.
          
          JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --
          
          A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows
          of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are
          sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.
          
          One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes
          flight, an explosion of purple wings.
          
          Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.
          
          ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her
          ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are
          closed. She speaks very softly to Jake --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When you hear nothing, you will hear
                    everything. When you see nothing, you
                    will See everything.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Sometimes I have no idea what she's
                    talking about.
          
          Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male
          HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
          
          Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri
          watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a
          beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's been a month and I'm still not
                    allowed to make a kill. She says the
                    forest hasn't given permission.
          
          OMIITED
          
          NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.   She points
          and he parts some leaves to see --
          
          A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk
          around her legs. She licks their faces.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    There's a lot of crap like that. She's
                    always going on about the flow of energy--
                    the spirits of the animals and what not --
          
                                                                        65.
          
          
          
          VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.    He's
          changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale.
          
                               JAKE
                        (SMIRKING)
                    I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on
                    the final.
          
          Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples.
          
                              GRACE
                        (without looking up)
                    This isn't just about eye-hand
                    coordination out there. You need to
                    listen to what she says. Try to see the
                    forest through their eyes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Excuse me -- this is my video-log here,
                    okay?
          
          NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by
          galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move
          gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.
          
          CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night
          forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.
          
          NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing
          from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom
          of a pool.
          
          A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.      ZAP!
          Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting
          his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are
          GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
          
          Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken.   Their eyes meet,
          and she pulls away quickly.
          
          NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.
          Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature
          on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING
          perched on a frond. As he approaches --
          
          SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a
          bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening
          like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
          
          THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.
          
                                                                        66.
          
          
          
          Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An
          EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.
          
          Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until
          they are all flying. And for the first time, she is
          unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He
          doesn't know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid,
          blinking at the light.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                    Everything is backwards now. Like out
                    there is the true world, and in here is
                    the dream.
          
          TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes
          focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies.
          
          JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede.
          He dispatches it with his knife.
          
          He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NA'VI)
                    I See you Brother, and thank you. Your
                    spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays
                    behind to become part of the People.
          
          NEYTIRI watches with approval.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    A clean kill. You are ready.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Lying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin.   Norm
          helps Grace get him to his chair.
          
                              GRACE
                    You're still losing weight.   Here --
          
          She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien
          food. Bites into it without enthusiasm.
          
                              JAKE
                    I made a kill today. We ate it.   I know
                    where that meal came from.
          
                                                                     67.
          
          
          
                               GRACE
                    Other body. You need to take care of
                    this body.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Yeah yeah.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, I'm serious -- you look like crap.
                    You're burning too hard.
          
          Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out.
          
                              JAKE
                    Get rid of this shit, then you can
                    lecture me.
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm telling you, as your boss and someone
                    who might even consider being a friend
                    someday, to take some down time.
          
                              JAKE
                    Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.
          
          GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee.
          
                              GRACE
                    Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee.
                    Or die trying.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right, Grace. This is what I've
                    been working for.
          
                              GRACE
                    And this is your check up from the neck
                    up, Marine. You're getting in way too
                    deep.
                        (she turns away)
                    Trust me, I learned the hard way.
          
          Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace's workstation.
          
                              JAKE
                    What did happen at the school?
          
          GRACE looks up from making coffee.   Her eyes track across the
          pictures of the laughing children.   Finally --
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped
                    coming to school. She was angry about
                    the clear-cutting.
          
          GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste.
          
                              GRACE
                    One day, she and a couple of other young
                    hunters came running in, all painted up --
                    they'd set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess
                    they thought I could protect them.
          
          GRACE'S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible
          story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator.
          
                              GRACE
                    The troopers pursued them to the
                    schoolhouse.
          
          MACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING.
          
                              GRACE
                    They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.
                    Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the
                    others.
                        (MILDLY)
                    I got most of the kids out, before they
                    shot me.
          
                              JAKE
                    Jesus.
          
                              GRACE
                    Yeah.
          
          Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and
          desperately trying to hide it.
          
                              GRACE
                    A scientist stays objective -- we can not
                    be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten
                    years of my life into that school. They
                    called me sa'atenuk. Mother.
                        (turning to him)
                    That kind of pain reaches back through
                    the link.
          
          GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's a job. Learn what you can -- but
                    don't get attached.
          
                                                                       69.
          
          
          
          GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's not our world, Jake.   And we can't
                    stop what's coming.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY
          
          TSU'TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two
          TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who's riding well enough to keep
          up. The horses' hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a
          misty canyon.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway
                    to heaven. It's the test every young
                    hunter has to pass.
          
          TSU'TEY signals a stop.
          
          UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like
          trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in
          their gnarled grip.
          
          A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the
          twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural
          occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the
          clouds.
          
          There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and
          the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at --
          
          One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a
          nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is
          drifting toward them, filling half the sky.
          
          The Hunters dismount.
          
          JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He
          turns to Tsu'tey, who is checking the young hunters' gear.
          
                              JAKE
                    We doin' this?
          
          Jake leaps to catch up as Tsu'tey and the hunters swarm up
          the base of the beanstalk.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
                                                                       70.
          
          
          
          EXT. BEANSTALK - DAY
          
          200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along
          the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium
          BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.
          
          JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of
          a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs
          over it -- it floats upward.
          
          They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them,
          the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from
          one of the waterfalls hits them.
          
          Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper
          branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.
          
          One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.
          
          Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling
          over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands
          above.
          
          EXT. MONS VERITATIS - DAY
          
          TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small
          island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis.
          
          WIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome --
          the sheer side of Mons Veritatis.
          
          Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of
          sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below.
          
          EXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY - DAY
          
          A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the
          gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below
          -- a view from Olympus.
          
          A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S
          BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She
          dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven
          HOOD. It waits, docile, as --
          
          She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them
          through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And
          Jake sees --
          
          The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out-
          croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls
          with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.
          
                                                                       71.
          
          
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Jakesully will go first.
          
          Tsu'tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two
          teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.
          
          Tsu'tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Now you choose your ikran. This you must
                    feel -- inside. If he also chooses you,
                    move quick, like I showed. You will have
                    one chance.
          
                              JAKE
                    How will I know if he chooses me?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    He will try to kill you.
          
                              JAKE
                    Outstanding.
          
          Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes
          it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like
          it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --
          
          The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK
          and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing
          rows of fangs, in a threat display.
          
          Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO.
          
          A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares
          straight at him.
          
          Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it.
          
                              JAKE
                    Let's dance.
          
          The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as--
          
          Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then
          slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.
          
          Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong
          whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED
          SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but --
          
                                                                      72.
          
          
          
          Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the
          banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he
          SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head.
          
          Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his
          queue but --
          
          The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in
          the face, almost knocking him out and --
          
          IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the
          rock and almost goes over the edge as --
          
          NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly.
          
          The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way
          pissed off now, but --
          
          Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his
          leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN
          HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top,
          pinning it and --
          
          Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams
          the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --
          
          The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting.   They
          are locked together, literally eye to eye.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right! You're mine.
          
          ECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well.
          
          Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over
          the creature's back.
          
          Neytiri runs to him.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    First flight seals the bond. You cannot
                    wait.
          
          Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power.   He grips
          a hank of the beast's main, and --
          
                              JAKE
                    Heeeyyyaaaah!
          
          THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS
          as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and --
          
                                                                      73.
          
          
          
          They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is
          almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so
          much he can't think.
          
                               JAKE
                     Shut the hell up!!
          
          It does.
          
                                  JAKE
                     Level out!     Fly straight!
          
          It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left"
          and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy
          loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath.
          
          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him.   She signals
          "follow me" and DIVES.
          
          Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri's
          banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while
          Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.
          
          THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE
          around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning.
          They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines.
          
          Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the
          cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge
          into sunlight.
          
          Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right,
          then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back.
          He's reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT.
          
          Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT./EXT. GROTTO/MONS VERITATIS - DAY
          
          FLIGHT MONTAGE:
          
          NEYTIRI squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight
          principles like one fighter pilot to another.
          
          LOOKING DOWN a sheer cliff. SWOOOSH! Jake and Neytiri dive
          their mounts STRAIGHT DOWN PAST CAMERA, pulling out and
          soaring into a series of aerobatic turns.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                     I may not be much of a horse guy.   But I
                     was born to do this.
          
                                                                      74.
          
          
          
          THEY FLY in close formation with TSU'TEY and the young
          HUNTERS, 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist.
          
          ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri
          among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world.
          She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can. He
          DIVES after her.
          
          IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKE'S BANSHEE snaps at a piece
          of meat which he playfully pulls back. He's teaching it to
          take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head.
          
          TSU'TEY is nearby with the young hunters.   He eyes Jake with
          frustrated hostility.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily.
          She points and Jake sees --
          
          A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form
          rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the
          caldera is a single, enormous WILLOW TREE, gnarled and
          ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RIDGE
          
          JAKE flies with Neytiri along a forested ridge. She is
          teaching him to hunt from his banshee. They carry their bows
          at the ready, scanning below them for prey.
          
          A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning.   Jake
          looks up to see --
          
          A LEONOPTERYX in a delta-dive, whistling straight at him.
          
          Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king
          predator of the air: the GREAT LEONOPTERYX.   Striped
          scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head
          -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
          
          The hunter has become the prey. JAKE snap-rolls and dives
          toward the forest canopy. He plummets into the gloom as --
          
          K-CRASH -- the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following
          him down, both diving like missiles and --
          
          JAKE yanks into a hair-pin bank, right through a gap between
          two huge branches --
          
          Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings.
          It banks away with a frustrated SHRIEK. Two flaps of its
          mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          
          CLOSE ON THE LEONOPTERYX, as its fanged mouth opens in a
          bloodcurdling SCREECH which echoes among the mountains. The
          lord of its domain.
          
          ON JAKE, shaken. Neytiri flies up, her expression the Na'vi
          equivalent of Oh my God. A beat -- they both crack up.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Jake ponders images Grace has called up at her workstation--
          science graphics of the Leonopteryx. Trudy and Norm are
          crowded around as well.
          
                              GRACE
                    The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial
                    predator. Not only rare, but the
                    sightings tend not to get reported.
          
          Trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb.
          
                              TRUDY
                    There usually isn't time to key the mike.
          
                              JAKE
                    The People call it Toruk.
          
                              NORM
                        (TRANSLATING)
                    Last Shadow.
          
                              JAKE
                    Last one you ever see.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I saw one take out a gunship once --
                    WHAM! Total frickin' yard sale. Ate the
                    crew like peanuts.
          
          TIME CUT -- Grace is scanning through images and Jake stops
          her on one -- a 3D aerial shot of the strange arched
          formation.
          
                                 JAKE
                    That's it.
          
                              GRACE
                    Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls.
                    It's their most sacred place.
          
          She moves the virtual camera, and we seem to fly around the
          Well of Souls, catching only a glimpse of the interior.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Something big is going on in there,
                    biologically. I'd die to get samples, but
                    outsiders are strictly forbidden.
          
          TIME CUT -- Jake looks through the pressure window at HUMAN
          GRACE and NORM outside. Wearing masks, they are taking
          readings from some time-series experiments Grace has set up.
          
          As TRUDY watches, JAKE works fast to download Grace's images
          of the Well of Souls onto a memory chip.
          
                              TRUDY
                    They're coming back.
          
          Jake pulls the chip, then hesitates. Torn by what he is
          doing.
          
                              TRUDY
                    If you don't give him something, he's
                    gonna shut us down.
          
          He hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her
          flight-suit just as Grace and Norm enter from the airlock.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Hey, guys.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE STARES up at the TOTEM SKULL, which we now recognize as
          that of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX. NEYTIRI watches as he reaches
          up to touch the tall indigo crest.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk
                    Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk
                    chose him. It has only happened five
                    times since the time of the First Songs.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's a long time.
          
          Neytiri takes his hand, because that's what the Na'vi do when
          they're telling you something important.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought the
                    clans together in a time of great sorrow.
                    All Na'vi people know this story.
          
                                                                       77.
          
          
          
          PUSH IN SLOWLY on the skull totem, then --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RIVER BED - DAY
          
          JAKE, NEYTIRI and other FLYING HUNTERS swoop low above a HERD
          OF STURMBEEST -- a rapids of thundering muscle. Dust rises
          from this living river like steam from a python's back.
          
          TRACKING WITH the herd. A HUNTER appears in FG, astride a
          direhorse at full gallop. The sight is breathtaking. He
          hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest CRASHES down,
          flipping twice from momentum.
          
          JAKE ROLLS IN like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming. He
          draws and fires his bow. The arrow strikes true, in the
          plexus between the armored shoulders and --
          
          THE BEAST crashes to the ground. Skids to a stop in a cloud
          of dust.
          
          NEYTIRI swoops in next to Jake, arms raised and grinning
          wolfishly.
          
          CU TSU'TEY, banking around Jake's kill.   Jake looks up, and
          Tsu'tey SALUTES in grudging admiration.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          The central space is lit by a BONFIRE, around which the HUNT
          FESTIVAL is in full swing. Wild dancing. People gnawing on
          massive sturmbeest ribs. A bowl of some kava-like intoxicant
          is passed around.
          
          NEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT.
          NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail.
          
          JAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx
          attack with his hands. The leaping fire-light plays across
          the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It
          seems to watch Jake.
          
          TSU'TEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face.
          
          Jake braces himself -- and Tsu'tey holds up the KAVA BOWL,
          offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch?
          
          Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters
          hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm.
          
                                                                       78.
          
          
          
                               GRACE
                    Watch that stuff.   It'll knock you into
                    next week.
          
          Jake offers the bowl back to Tsu'tey.   They lock eyes.
          Tsu'tey drinks.
          
          LATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty
          bowls near the fire.
          
          WIDER ON JAKE and TSU'TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters.
          Tsu'tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I thought -- enough drink -- you would
                    not be so ugly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Sorry.
          
          Tsu'tey looks deep into the fire.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Your warriors -- hide inside machines --
                    fight from far away.
                        (he looks at Jake)
                    I did not think a sky person could be
                    brave.
          
          Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRI'S lithe shape runs through
          the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes
          Jake by the hand and pulls him up --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You must dance! It is the way.
          
          TSU'TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening --
          the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger.
          
          The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of
          dancers.
          
          Jake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting.
          
          JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets
          himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal
          energy.
          
          GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so
          repressed, who lives within her.
          
          Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are
          looking only at each other.
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
          A couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle
          are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN
          follow their look, seeing the obvious connection.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is
                    with Tsu'tey.
          
          ON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked
          with Neytiri.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          WIDE VISTA -- mist blowing through the treetops as the
          morning sun burns it away. A spectacular panorama of a vast,
          primeval land.
          
          UP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down
          like light in a cathedral.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's hard to put in words the deep
                    connection the People have to the forest.
          
          HIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri
          gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping
          nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly
          sensuous image.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    They see a network of energy that flows
                    through all living things. They know that
                    all energy is only borrowed--
          
          MACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops.   A blue
          hand picks the flower.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    -- and one day you have to give it back.
          
          LOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of
          an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby
          in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed
          on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads.
          
          Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places
          a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body.
          
          Earth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO --
          
                                                                       80.
          
          
          
          JAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the
          lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and
          haggard, with a scraggly beard.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Hard to believe it's only been three
                    months.
          
          JAKE SITS in front of the video log camera, late at night. It
          is many log entries later. He has lost a lot of weight. He
          looks like a junkie watching a test pattern.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to the lens)
                    I can barely remember my old life. I'm
                    not sure who I am anymore.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. COMPOUND - DAY
          
          Under a sky of thunderheads, the forest is a dark wall beyond
          the fence. SELFRIDGE, wearing an exopack, TEES UP while GRACE
          and JAKE approach from the direction of the Ops Center.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Good of you to stop by. How's it going
                    out there? Our blue friends all packed
                    up yet?
          
          Selfridge swings his DRIVER with good form.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    See, I keep hooking it.   It's the damn
                    pack.
          
          THE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads
          220. A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    The low gravity and the high air density
                    cancel out so --
          
                              JAKE
                    You called us back to report -- you want
                    to hear it or not?
          
                                SELFRIDGE
                    Go ahead.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake is making incredible progress, years
                    worth in just a few months. But -- we
                    need more time.
          
                                                                    81.
          
          
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Not what I was hoping to hear.
          
          It starts to rain. Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from
          his golf bag and snaps it open.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, it's their ancestral home.
                    They've lived there since before human
                    history began. You can spare them a few
                    more weeks.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    This thing is inevitable. What does it
                    matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr.
                    Augustine. You're out of time.
          
          He leaves them standing there to get drenched.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY
          
          A break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls
          up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake.
          He studies Jake's pale, sunken face. The scraggly beard.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are
                    you son?
          
          Jake can't meet his eyes.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Your last report was two weeks ago. I'm
                    starting to doubt your resolve. From what
                    I see, it's time to terminate this
                    mission.
          
          Jake eyes flare with alarm.
          
                                JAKE
                    No.    I can do this.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Look, you've given me plenty of usable
                    intel. Like this "Well of Souls" place --
                    I've got them by the balls with that,
                    when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it
                    will.
          
          Jake feels hollow inside, knowing what he's done.
          
                                                                      82.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    So you'll get your legs back, like I
                    promised.
                        (puts his hand on Jake's
                         SHOULDER)
                    It's time to come in.
          
          Jake ponders this. Isn't this what he was doing all this for?
          
                              JAKE
                    I've gotta finish this thing. There's
                    one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the
                    final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm
                    one of them. They'll trust what I say...
          
          It's hard for him to even form these words --
          
                              JAKE
                    ... and I can negotiate the terms of
                    their relocation.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Then you need to get it done, Corporal.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS - NIGHT
          
          Strange horizontal LIGHTNING branches through the floating
          mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields. The sky is black
          and heavy with clouds.
          
          INT. SHACK KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking
          pretty STRUNG OUT. GRACE is smoking furiously.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, I can't allow this.   You're just
                    not strong enough.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's the last door -- I'm going through
                    it. You can help me or get out of the
                    way.
          
          Jake pushes past her toward the corridor --
          
                              GRACE
                        (grabbing him)
                    Will you listen to me? Sometimes the
                    Na'vi themselves die in these vision
                    quests. The venom takes you to the edge
                    of death.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                        83.
          
                              GRACE (cont'd)
                    And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm-
                    - we have no idea what that'll do in an
                    avatar brain.
          
          Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor.
          
          GRACE follows JAKE as he crosses to the Link. A sheet of
          LIGHTNING flashes across the sky outside.
          
          Norm is initializing the Link.
          
                              NORM
                    Calibrating. Thirty seconds.
          
          She puts her hands on his shoulders.
          
                              GRACE
                    No matter what you prove out there-- you
                    are still in here.
                        (shaking him)
                    Right here.
          
                              JAKE
                    I have to go all the way -- become one of
                    THEM--
          
                              GRACE
                        (FURIOUSLY)
                    Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of
                    them!
          
          Norm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE' voice.
          
                              GRACE
                    Our life out there takes millions of
                    dollars of machinery to sustain. You
                    visit -- and you leave.
          
          During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering
          himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside.
          
                              GRACE
                        (SOFTENING)
                    You can never truly be with her.
          
          Jake stops, pinioned by the truth.   He seems suddenly very
          lost.
          
                              JAKE
                    You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch
                    sent me.
          
                              NORM
                    What?
          
                                                                      84.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right -- to embed with the
                    Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them
                    out of their home. By deceit or by
                    force, he didn't care. And if it turned
                    out to be force, then how best to do it.
          
          Norm is in shock.   But Grace is eerily calm.
          
                              GRACE
                    And what about now, Jake?
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm not that guy any more.
          
          Grace nods.   She's been on his journey every step of the way.
          
                               GRACE
                    I know.
          
                              JAKE
                    But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he
                    yanks me out -- I never see her again.
                    And if I tell her the truth, the clan
                    throws me out -- that's if they don't cut
                    my heart out and show it to me.
          
          Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them.   In his own perfect
          Hell.
          
                              NORM
                    They won't understand what you've done.
          
                              JAKE
                    They don't even have a word for "lie" --
                    they had to learn it from us.
          
          Grace sees he is on the verge of tears.   Lost and alone,
          between worlds.
          
                              GRACE
                    I know. I taught it to them.
          
                              JAKE
                        (PLEADING)
                    Grace. I've gotta go.   They're waiting.
          
                              NORM
                    Link is ready.
          
          Grace stops him as he tries to close the lid.
          
                                                                      85.
          
          
          
                             GRACE
                    Jake. You can't carry this burden much
                    longer.
          
                              JAKE
                        (smiling wanly)
                    It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind
                    probably can't survive the Dream Hunt
                    anyway.
          
          Grace closes the lid. It feels like closing a coffin. She
          watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar,
          somewhere out in the night.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Norm)
                    Prep my link. I'm going in.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE SITS, eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter
          paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron -- the
          Dream Hunt.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When your Spirit Animal comes, you will
                    know.
          
          Their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer.
          
          TIME CUT. GRACE stands with the crowd at the ramp to
          HOMETREE'S LOWEST LEVEL. Jake barely sees her as he goes down
          the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter.
          
          BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly
          into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and
          hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM.
          
          TIME CUT -- MO'AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs,
          CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the
          smoke over himself with his palms.
          
          MACRO - MO'AT'S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with
          holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and
          draws it out of the wood.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree --
                    bless this worthy Hunter with a true
                    vision.
          
                                                                       86.
          
          
          
          MO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It
          twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She
          indicates he should chew. He does.
          
          MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a
          writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a
          scorpion.
          
          He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The
          insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and --
          
          Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake
          alone in the circle.
          
          Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant.
          
          SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the
          faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening.
          
          Jake looks down at the palms of his hands.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground
          and --
          
          INSTANTLY the circle of Na'vi recedes, as if to a distant
          horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly
          distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS.
          
          ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and --
          
          The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees,
          which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral
          radiance. Jake looks down --
          
          JAKE'S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers
          stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread
          outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which
          connect to the roots of the trees and --
          
          CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in
          the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom
          contracts his muscles but --
          
          IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN
          CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X
          silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW.
          
          CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE
          RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which
          FILLS THE UNIVERSE and --
          
                                                                       87.
          
          
          
          REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles
          seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his
          head, while inside --
          
          TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the
          mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the
          wind of time blowing through him as --
          
          REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while --
          
          INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora --
          
          --but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that
          are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight.
          
          A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the
          devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow.
          Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and --
          
          PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly
          and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK
          which seems to echo to eternity and --
          
          SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body.
          He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room.
          
                              MO'AT
                    It is finished.
          
          Neytiri's face is flooded with relief.   The faces of the clan
          elders look at Jake expectantly.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Did your Spirit Animal come?
          
          Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders. How
          can he tell them what he has seen?
          
          Mo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to
          peer into his troubled soul.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Jake)
                    Something has come.
                        (to the others, subtitled)
                    It will take time for the meaning to be
                    clear.
          
          She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He
          gets up, weakly.
          
                                                                       88.
          
          
          
          OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the
          others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what
          has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem,
          which seems to stare down at him.
          
          GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed.
          
          Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them
          there.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    You are now a son of the Omaticaya.   You
                    are part of the People.
          
          All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around
          and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest --
          hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them
          waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS
          RISES behind the trees.
          
          NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water.
          Jake follows her and --
          
          UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES.
          
          They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden
          of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them.
          
          Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float
          weightlessly, as if between worlds.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their
          trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing
          tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains.
          
          Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their
          footsteps with expanding rings of light.
          
          It is an exquisitely beautiful spot.
          
          The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up
          her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her.
          
                                                                       89.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This is a place for prayers to be heard.
                    And sometimes answered.
          
          Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his
          fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear
          the WHISPERING of ancient Na'vi VOICES.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's like -- a sound you feel.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of
                    Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who
                    live within Eywa.
          
          A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their
          shoulders and arms.
          
          They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense,
          almost luminous. He feels drawn into them.
          
          But she pulls back a little.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You are Omaticaya now. You may make your
                    own bow from the wood of Hometree.
                        (she looks away)
                    And you may choose a woman.
          
          The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual.   Jake
          suppresses a smile.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    We have many fine women. Ninat is the
                    best singer --
          
                              JAKE
                    I don't want Ninat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter --
          
          Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her.
          
                              JAKE
                    I've already chosen. But this woman must
                    also choose me.
          
          She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving
          gently over each other.
          
                                                                       90.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    She already has.
          
          He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against
          his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other.
          
          Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Kissing is very good. But we have
                    something better.
          
          She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other
          on the faintly glowing moss.
          
          Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does
          the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the
          ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined.
          
          MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle
          undulations.
          
          JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system
          and hers. The ultimate intimacy.
          
          They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of
          moss, and ripples of light spread out around them.
          
          THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with
          pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO --
          
          LATER. She is collapsed across his chest.     Spent.   He
          strokes her face tenderly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Neytiri, you know my real body is far
                    away, sleeping.
          
          She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This body is real.
                        (she touches his forehead)
                    This spirit is real.
          
          Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When I was first your teacher, I hated
                    all Sky People. But you have also taught
                    me.
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Spirit is all that matters.
          
                                                                       91.
          
          
          
          She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his
          heartbeat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for
                    life.
          
                                 JAKE
                    We are?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Yes. It is our way.
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    Oh. I forgot to tell?
          
          He rouses up, making her look at him.
          
                              JAKE
                    Really, we are?
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    We are.
          
          Jake considers this.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's cool. I'm there.
          
          He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering
          him as he sleeps.
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He just lies there,
          thinking. In his coffin. In another world.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN
          
          DAWN BREAKS in the sacred glade. Shafts of orange morning
          light. Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms. Maxfield
          Parrish painting. But then --
          
          THE ROAR OF ENGINES. Neytiri awakens with a start. The
          SPLINTERING, CRACKLING of forest being crushed under enormous
          treads gets louder.
          
          SHE WATCHES in growing horror as the BLADE of a bulldozer
          becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows.
          She shakes Jake, shouting at him in Na'vi to wake up.
          
                                                                       92.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come
                    back to me now. Jake!
          
          INT. SHACK - DAWN
          
          HUMAN JAKE is in a hurry to get back to the link. GRACE,
          still groggy, chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs.
          
                              GRACE
                    Here -- eat this. I'd hate to have to
                    force-feed a cripple.
          
          She slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the
          plate under his nose.
          
                              GRACE
                        (GRINNING)
                    She's not going anywhere.
          
          He sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN
          
          Neytiri SCREAMS as --
          
          The willows begin to fall before the blade, to be ground
          under the treads. AVATAR JAKE is directly in the path. She
          tries to lift him, but he is too heavy. She is screaming at
          him, frantically trying to wake him, as --
          
          INT. SHACK - DAWN
          
          Jake adjusts himself in the link chair. He hands Grace the
          empty plate.
          
                              GRACE
                    And when was the last time you took a
                    shower? Jesus, Marine.
          
          Jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          AVATAR JAKE wakes up to see --
          
          NEYTIRI dragging him, screaming.   He leaps up as --
          
          THE DOZER pushes inexorably into the glade, splintering the
          trees, plowing the earth before it.
          
          JAKE RUNS into the path of the bulldozer, waving his arms.
          
                                                                       93.
          
          
          
                                JAKE
                    Hey!    Heeeey! Stop! Stop!
          
          He positions himself where the camera-eyes of the robotic
          juggernaut will see him.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON MONITOR -- Jake shouts but there's no sound feed.
          
          WIDER as the TRACTOR OPERATOR sees him and pulls back on the
          remote throttles. He yells to his SUPERVISOR.
          
                              OPERATOR
                    Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my
                    blade here.
          
          This attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to
          the workstation.
          
          ON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and
          ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable.
          
                              SUPERVISOR
                        (to Selfridge)
                    What do we do?
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Roll on. He'll move. These people have
                    to learn that we don't stop.
          
          TIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward.
          
          ON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below
          the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          JAKE grabs a rock and LEAPS onto the dozer.   He climbs
          quickly to the CAMERA MAST.
          
          SMASH! The rock crashes into the lens of the camera. Jake
          beats the rock furiously against it, pounding it to junk.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER
          
          CLOSE ON MONITOR -- as Jake's demonic face is replaced by
          noise.
          
                                 OPERATOR
                    I'm blind.
          
          He pulls back on the throttles.
          
                                                                       94.
          
          
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          THE JUGGERNAUT grinds to a stop. But the ROAR of engines
          continues because --
          
          MORE DOZERS and TRACTORS advance nearby, crushing the forest
          before them. Trees are slashed down by the PLASMA CUTTERS.
          Terrified animals flee before the onslaught.
          
          POWERSUITS and TROOPERS stride through the ravaged forest,
          blasting anything that moves. A trooper sees Jake on the
          dozer. He rips off a BURST and --
          
          Rounds CLANG into metal as Jake dives off the machine. He
          grabs Neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. From
          behind a screen of leaves, they watch as --
          
          THE DOZERS advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving
          only mud and wood splinters in their path.
          
          CU NEYTIRI, stunned by the nightmarish, unfathomable
          wrongness of it. She sobs as the willows die.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER
          
          MINUTES LATER, the operator is playing back the CAMERA'S FEED
          for Quaritch and the others.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Freeze it, right -- there.
          
          ON MONITOR -- the image expands, until Jake's face is clear,
          frozen in an animal snarl.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Son of a bitch!
          
          PUSH IN ON QUARITCH as his jaw clenches in cold fury.
          
          He turns and strides toward the door, shouting to his WATCH
          COMMANDER as he passes.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Get me a pilot!

          A RAIDING PARTY of hunters, their bodies painted, raise
          weapons overhead. AVATAR GRACE watches with growing alarm.
          
                                                                        95.

                    Tsu'tey will lead the war party!
          
          Tsu'tey steps forward, face full of hate, raising a war cry
          among the hunters.
          
                              GRACE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Please -- this will only make it worse --
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    You do not speak here!
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI cross the commons toward them. Jake feels
          all eyes turn toward him. He takes her arm, stopping her.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Neytiri, low)
                    Okay, listen. There's something I have to
                    tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just
                    need you to --
          
          He sees TSU'TEY striding toward them, his face a mask of
          fury.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                    You!
          
          Tsu'tey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both
          hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    You mated with this woman?!
          
                               GRACE
                    Oh shit.
          
          Jake stands. He reaches out for Neytiri.   She goes to him,
          clutching his hand.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Is this true?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    We are mated before Eywa. It is done.
          
          Tsu'tey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished.
          
                                                                       96.

                    Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is
                    changing. Everything is being destroyed!
          
          Tsu'tey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These aliens kill everything they touch,
                    like poison.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can
                    never be Tsahik. Your life will be
                    wasted.
          
          Neytiri looks at her mother -- sees the grief in her eyes.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I have chosen.
          
          Tsu'tey draws his knife and --
          
                                 TSU'TEY
                    Yeeeeeaaa!
          
          LUNGES AT JAKE, who's ready this time -- he sidesteps,
          blocking the knife, and elbows Tsu'tey HARD in the face.
          
          Tsu'tey reels back, nose bleeding. He starts forward on a
          second attack but --
          
          Eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around.

                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Stop! This is not a proper challenge.
          
          Tsu'tey glares at Jake while sheathing his knife.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I challenge you.

                                 JAKE
                    I accept.

          QUARITCH rides left seat as Trudy pilots through the
          mountains. She glances at him, then toggles the aircom.
          
                                 TRUDY
                       Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound
                       hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch
                       with me and --
          
          But Quaritch SLAMS the switch, cutting her off.
          
                                 QUARITCH
                       Did I tell you to announce us?
          
                                 TRUDY
                       Sorry sir, it's procedure.

          Norm punches buttons on the comms console.

                       Samson One Six?   Trudy?
                           (no answer)
                       Crap.
          
          He looks helplessly at Jake and Grace's link units -- no way
          to warn them.
          
          INT. HOMETREE - DAY
          
          TSU'TEY AND JAKE square off. Each holds a long, solid staff.
          The entire clan crowds around them in a circle.
          
                                 GRACE
                       What the hell are you doing?
          
                                 JAKE
                       It's the only way to get him to goddamn
                       listen.
          
          TSU'TEY LEAPS at Jake with a sharp cry and Jake parries with
          his staff. The staves CLACK off each other as the two
          combatants LEAP, DUCK and STRIKE furiously.
          
          Tsu'tey sweeps Jake off his feet with a roundhouse hit to the
          ankles, but --
          
          Jake ROLLS out of it and catches Tsu'tey in the belly with
          the blunt end.
          
                                                                            98.

          TRUDY'S SAMSON lands. QUARITCH and a posse of troopers jump
          down and rush the Shack.
          
          INT. COMMONS
          
          TSU'TEY wades in with a series of short, sharp blows. Jake
          swings with equal fury. Both fighting from the heart.
          
          The staves whistle through the air, and CLACK together like
          gunshots. Jake presses hard, and Tsu'tey staggers back,
          stumbling as --
          
          Jake lands a SOLID HIT, dropping him to his knees, just as --
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          THE INNER DOOR bangs open and QUARITCH stomps toward Grace's

          AVATAR GRACE'S eyes roll back and she keels over.       NEYTIRI
          barely catches her before she hits the ground.
          
          JAKE parries as Tsu'tey swings but then --
          
          Jake's eyes go blank just as -- K-RACK! Tsu'tey puts one
          alongside his head. Jake sprawls, completely inert. Tsu'tey
          pokes him with his staff, then raises it and lets out a
          piercing VICTORY CRY.
          
          INT. SHACK - DAY
          
          JAKE SLAMS OPEN the Link, amped from the fight, furious --

                       You crossed a line.
          
          Quaritch PUNCHES HIM HARD. Jake flops back, dazed. The
          troopers yank him out and ZIP-TIE his wrists.
          
                                                                       99.

                    This is a demon in a false body. It
                    should not live.
          
          He puts his knife to Jake's throat but --
          
          NEYTIRI BLIND-SIDES him at full tilt. Tsu'tey sprawls, rolls,
          comes up to see --
          
          Neytiri crouched like a lioness over Jake, her KNIFE and
          teeth bared, her ears flattened. She SNARLS with primal
          fury.
          
          Tsu'tey stands panting. He pushes through the crowd and walks
          away, calling for his hunters.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          WIDER -- HUMAN JAKE sits, bruised and bleeding, watching
          himself on the monitor. GRACE and NORM stand nearby, rubbing
          their wrists where the zip-ties bit in. SELFRIDGE and
          QUARITCH watch with disdain.
          
                              QUARITCH

          Grace is momentarily stunned by Quaritch's fury. But she
          meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch.

                    Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot
                    me?
                        (to Selfridge)
                    You need to muzzle your dog!
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Can we just take this down a couple
                    notches, please.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Quaritch)
                    You say you want to keep your people
                    alive. Start by listening to her.
          
          Jake nods to Grace to continue.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Selfridge)
                    This is bad, Parker. Those trees were
                    sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you
                    can't imagine.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You know what? You throw a stick in the
                    air around here it falls on some sacred
                    fern.
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here --
                    I'm talking about something real and
                    measurable in the biology of the forest.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                        (FRUSTRATED)
                    Which is what exactly?
          
          Grace's nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the
          need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific
          rigor.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Jake)
                    I can't do this. How am I supposed to
                    reduce years of work to a sound bite for
                    the illiterate?
          
                              JAKE
                    Just tell him what you know in your
                    heart.
          
          She turns to Parker, steeling herself.
          
                                                                   101.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Alright, look -- I don't have the answers
                    yet, I'm just now starting to even frame
                    the questions. What we think we know --
                    is that there's some kind of
                    electrochemical communication between the
                    roots of the trees. Like the synapses
                    between neurons. Each tree has ten to the
                    fourth connections to the trees around
                    it, and there are ten to the twelfth
                    trees on Pandora --
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    That's a lot I'm guessing.
          
                               GRACE
                    That's more connections than the human
                    brain. You get it? It's a network -- a
                    global network. And the Na'vi can access
                    it -- they can upload and download data --
                    memories -- at sites like the one you
                    destroyed.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    What the hell have you people been
                    smoking out there? They're just.
                    Goddamn. Trees.
          
                              GRACE
                    You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth
                    of this world isn't in the ground -- it's
                    all around us. The Na'vi know that, and
                    they're fighting to defend it. If you
                    want to share this world with them, you
                    need to understand them.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    We understand them just fine.   Thanks to
                    Jake here.
          
          Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a
          NEW CLIP on the main monitor --
          
          TIGHT ON MONITOR -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard
          and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue.
          
                              JAKE (RECORDED)
                    They're not going to give up their home --
                    they're not gonna make a deal. For what?
                    Lite beer and shopping channel? There's
                    nothing we have that they want. We're a
                    horror to them. We're the monsters from
                    space.
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
          
          JAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the
          people he has grown to love.
          
                              JAKE (RECORDED)
                    They're never going to leave Hometree.
          
          Quaritch FREEZES the recording.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Since a deal can't be made -- it gets
                    real simple.
                        (to Jake, icily)
                    So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I
                    might just give you a big wet kiss.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, we have to talk, like rational
                    people.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately
                    you're out of here on the next shuttle.
                    All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar
                    Program, effective now.
          
          ON JAKE, GRACE AND NORM, speechless.
                                                       SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
          
          A WALL OF FIRE. Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW
          MOTION, spears and bows held high.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - MORNING
          
          MONITOR SCREEN IMAGE -- WAINFLEET pans a camera across the
          smoldering hulks of BURNED DOZERS. The toppled remains of a
          charred ampsuit. Dead troopers bristling with arrows.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    They hit with banshees first. Set the
                    ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast.
          
          Quaritch and Selfridge look on grimly.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    The rest of the squad?
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the
                    equipment is totalled.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Christ.
          
                                                                     103.

          Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I can do it with minimal casualties to
                    the indigenous. We'll clear them out
                    with gas first. It'll be humane. More or
                    less.
          
          Selfridge sighs and rubs his face.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is
                    exactly the incident we needed.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Alright, let's pull the trigger.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. BIO LAB
          
          MAX and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment,
          under the watchful eye of armed SEC-OPS TROOPERS. JAKE,
          GRACE, NORM stare bleakly at each other.
          
                              GRACE
                    They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose,
                    to trigger a response. They're
                    fabricating this war to get what they
                    want.
          
                              NORM
                    I can't believe that.
          
                               JAKE
                    Yup. That's how it's done. When people
                    are sitting on shit you want, you make
                    them your enemy. Then you're justified in
                    taking it.
          
          TRUDY RUNS into the lab, breathless. She's wearing full
          flight gear and carrying her helmet.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.   They're
                    gonna hit Hometree!
          
                                JAKE
                    When?
          
                                TRUDY
                    Now.    We're spooling up now! I gotta go.
          
                                                                    104.

                    My God.
          
          Jake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DAY
          
          SELFRIDGE surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the
          gunships, loading ordnance. He turns as JAKE and GRACE
          charge toward him.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, wait. Stop! These are people
                    you're about to --
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    They're fly-bitten savages who live in a
                    tree! Look around -- I don't know about
                    you but I see a lot of trees. They can
                    move.
          
                              GRACE
                    For God's sake, there are children in
                    there. Babies!
          
                              JAKE
                    Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind
                    of blood on your hands. Let me try to
                    talk them out. They trust me.
          
          ON SELFRIDGE, considering this.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          SELFRIDGE and an escort of armed TROOPERS accompany Jake and
          Grace to the links. The two enter their units, as NORM and
          MAX prep the system.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You've got one hour. Unless you want
                    your girlfriend in there when the axe
                    comes down, you get them to evacuate. One
                    hour.
          
          Jake lowers the upper clamshell. Norm starts the sequence.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS -DAY
          
          The entire clan is gathered, with Eytukan and Mo'at
          presiding. Jake looks around, feeling the gaze of the People
          upon him. He steels himself, and speaks in clear Na'vi --
          
                                                                  105.

                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Eytukan, I have something to say, to
                    everyone.
          
                              EYTUKAN

                              JAKE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    A great evil is upon us. The Sky People
                    are coming to destroy Hometree. They
                    will be here soon.
          
          A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd.

                        (SUBTITLED)
                    You have to leave, or you will die.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Are you certain of this?
          
                              JAKE
                    They sent me here to learn your ways. So
                    one day I could bring this message, and
                    you would believe it.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    What are you saying, Jake? You knew this
                    would happen?
          
          He is unable to meet her eyes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yes.

                    At first it was just orders. Then
                    everything changed. I fell in love--
                    with the forest, with the Omaticaya
                    People --
                        (he looks at her)
                    -- with you. And by then, how could I
                    tell you?
          
          Neytiri can barely breathe. She is shaking with the enormity
          of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I trusted you, Jake!
          
                                                                   106.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You will never be one of the People!
                    NEVER!
          
          TSU'TEY yells to his HUNTERS --
          
                               TSUTEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bind them.
          
          They grab Jake, who doesn't resist. Others seize Grace.
          Both are driven to their knees, and their arms bound.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          SCORPION GUNSHIPS darken the sky as they come over the tops
          of the trees. At the head of the formation is one much
          larger ship, a monster 150 feet long -- the GENERAL DYNAMICS
          C-21 DRAGON GUNSHIP.
          
          Quaritch, next to the pilot of the Dragon, surveys the world
          below like Napoleon astride his horse.
          
          EXT. HOMETREE
          
          JAKE and GRACE are lashed to posts at the front entrance to
          Hometree. The People look up as --
          
          THE DRAGON and its escort of GUNSHIPS arrive over the trees.
          The DOWN-BLAST from their rotors creates a maelstrom of
          flying leaves and debris.
          
          IN THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches a targeting screen --
          a telescopic image of Jake and Grace tied to posts.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Well, I'd say diplomacy has failed.
          
          TSU'TEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the
          two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I think they mean to cut their throats if
                    we don't back off. Make sure you get a
                    nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto
                    the after-action report.
          
          JAKE YELLS to Neytiri, Tsu'tey, the others gathered nearby --
          
                                                                      107.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    You have to get out of Hometree! Run to
                    the forest! Please, I'm begging you!
          
          EYTUKAN scowls at Jake, then GRABS TSU'TEY and yells --
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Take the ikran! Attack from above!
          
          Tsu'tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree.
          
          IN THE COCKPIT Quaritch grows impatient.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Alright, let's get this done. Give me
                    forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the
                    front door.
          
                               GUNNER
                    Roger.   CS forties. Going hot.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    Fire.
          
          On the Dragon's stub-wings the 40mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up
          with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and --
          
          K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM! -- the inside of Hometree ERUPTS
          with multiple EXPLOSIONS of TEARGAS.
          
          THE GAS rolls across the confused villagers. They begin to
          cough and gag.
          
          Eytukan and the remaining HUNTERS bravely fire at the
          gunships with their longbows.
          
          IN THE DRAGON'S COCKPIT, Quaritch laughs as arrows CLINK
          against the armored windows.
          
          AMID CLOUDS of teargas, the Omaticaya run, stumble, collapse.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (yelling/subtitled)
                    Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.
          
          The villagers pour out of Hometree. Everyone is yelling.
          Piercing SCREAMS in the boiling gas.
          
          JAKE, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings.
          
          KA-WHOOM! An INCENDIARY ROUND explodes inside the Commons.
          FLAMES ROAR through the base of Hometree.
          
                                                                     108.
          
          
          
          INSIDE HOMETREE it is a burning smoky HELL. Flames roar up
          the inside like a chimney. STRAGGLERS scramble outside,
          coughing and dragging wounded with them.
          
          High up in the trunk, TSU'TEY and his hunters leap rapidly
          from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball.
          
          OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotor-wash toward JAKE and
          GRACE who are still bound tightly to the posts.
          
          Out of the smoke, MO'AT appears in front of Jake.    She raises
          a KNIFE and --
          
          SLASHES DOWNWARD. Jake looks down, surprised, to see his
          bonds falling away. He meets her eyes, which are filled with
          horror, but also something else. Call it faith.
          
                              MO'AT
                    You are one of us.   Help us!
          
          Jake takes the knife and cuts Grace free.
          
                              JAKE
                    We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the
                    columns.
          
          As Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they RUN.
          Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion.
          
          IN THE COCKPIT, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away
          from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay,
                    switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the
                    base of the west columns.
          
                              PILOTS (V.O.)
                    Copy, switching missiles.
          
          IN TRUDY'S SAMSON -- she hears the other pilots acknowledging
          Quaritch's order.
          
                                TRUDY
                    Screw it.
          
          She takes her finger OFF the fire-control and pulls her
          aircraft out of formation.
          
          PUSHING IN ON QUARITCH, the Hometree reflecting in his
          glasses.
          
                                                                      109.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Bring it down.
          
          MISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships
          and --
          
          The base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGH-EXPLOSIVE
          BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and --
          
          The Omaticaya watch in horror as --
          
          HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE.
          
          In a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty
          tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness.
          
          AT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSU'TEY and the other hunters spur
          their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as
          the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES.
          
          It CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the
          lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY.
          
          HOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a
          great cloud of dust and pulverized debris.
          
          IN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Nice work people. Alright, let's light
                    it up.
          
          INCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts
          of FIRE in the debris of Hometree.
          
          THE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a fire-
          storm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances.
          
          JAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks.
          
                               JAKE
                    Neytiri!   Neytiri!
          
          GRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away
          from the fire-storm.
          
          NEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of
          the INFERNO. She sees --
          
          EYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a
          spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him.
          
                                                                      110.
          
          
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the
                    People.
          
          In his last living moment he places his bow in her hands.
          
          She collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief.
          
          JAKE reels out of the smoke.    Kneels next to her.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm sorry --
          
          She shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears
          stream down her face.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never
                    come back!
          
          Jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father's body.
          Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as --
          
          NETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her
          stomach. Keening like an animal.
          
          SLOW MOTION -- Jake staggers lost and alone through the
          burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I was a warrior who dreamed he could
                    bring peace. Sooner or later though, you
                    always have to wake up...
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          SELFRIDGE watches a video feed of the destruction on one of
          the monitors. Max and NORM stare in shock.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Pull the plug.
          
          A TROOPER crosses to the console and grabs the handle of the
          MASTER BREAKER --
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST
          
          The strings are cut. Jake flops to the ground, limp.
          
          Elsewhere in the smoky Hell, Grace slumps unconscious. The
          crying kids pull at her. Mo'at, leading a group of
          Omaticaya, comes upon the scene.
          
                                                                     111.
          
          
          
          She grabs the kids and pulls them away, leaving Grace's
          avatar helpless in the path of the flames. She hesitates,
          then --
          
                               MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bring her.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          BLACKNESS. Then the top clamshell of Jake's unit is yanked
          upward, and troopers grab him, zip-tie his wrists as we --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DUSK
          
          ON A HILLSIDE -- a grieving Neytiri stands with Mo'at and the
          Omaticaya refugees. Two hunters pull Grace's avatar on a
          travois.
          
          They watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below. A
          great pall of smoke darkens the landscape.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. LOCK-UP - NIGHT
          
          Jake, Grace, and Norm are in a common holding cell. They
          sit, staring in silence. Too wired to sleep, too emotionally
          drained to move.
          
                              GRACE
                    They never wanted us to succeed.
          
          AT THE DESK OUTSIDE, the lone TROOPER looks up as --
          
          TRUDY approaches along the corridor, pushing a stainless
          steel trolley.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Personally I think steak's too good for
                    these traitors.
          
                              GUARD
                    They get steak?    That's bullshit. Let me
                    see that --
          
          The guard bends to look into the hot cart and   --
          
          THE MUZZLE of Trudy's pistol presses behind his ear.
          
                                                                     112.
          
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oops.
                        (shoving him down)
                    All the way down, pendejo.
          
          She WHISTLES and MAX trots around the corner.
          
          Trudy binds the guard with one of his own zip-ties as Max
          grabs his KEY CARD and runs to the cell. Swipes the card.
          The door is rolling open when --
          
          ANOTHER TROOPER rounds the corner. Trudy takes him down with
          a sharp BLOW to the windpipe and a THAI KNEE to the ribs.
          
          Meanwhile the first TROOPER is getting up, but Max CLOCKS him
          heartily with a coffee urn. He goes down and stays down.
          
                              MAX
                    That was unexpectedly satisfying.
          
          Trudy plants a kiss on Norm as he runs out of the cell.
          
                              NORM
                    Baby, you rock.
          
          Jake wheels out, grabbing the sidearm from the fallen trooper
          as Trudy binds his wrists.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Max and Trudy)
                    Thanks.
          
          Jake faces his motley group, chambering a round.
          
                              JAKE
                    So what do you say?    Time for a
                    revolution?
          
                                GRACE
                    I'm free.
          
          Trudy grins and taps his fist.
          
                                JAKE
                    Come on.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. UTILIDOR
          
          In the utility corridor under the base, Jake pumps the chair
          furiously, as the others jog. They reach an AIRLOCK and start
          donning EXOPACKS.
          
                                                                        113.
          
          
          
                                JAKE
                          (to Trudy)
                      Get your ship fired up.
          
          Trudy nods. She grabs Norm and enters the airlock.     Jake
          turns to Max.
          
                                JAKE
                      Stay here. I need somebody on the inside
                      I can trust.
          
          Max nods.   Jake grips his hand tightly.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. AIRFIELD - NIGHT
          
          IN THE SAMSON, Norm is helping Trudy race through the
          preflight checks as the turbines spool up. A LIGHT hits
          them.
          
          An armored TROOPER approaches, aiming his AR at them.
          
                                TROOPER
                      I need you to shut down and step out of
                      the vehicle! Now!
          
          JAKE rolls up behind him, aiming his pistol.
          
                                JAKE
                      Take it nice and easy, troop.
          
          The trooper turns, sees the gun.
          
                                 JAKE
                      On the ground, face down. Hands behind
                      your head.
          
          The trooper hesitates.
          
                                GRACE
                      Do what he goddamn says!
          
          He does. Norm jumps down and grabs the trooper's rifle and
          side-arm, covering him, while Grace helps Jake from chair to
          the back bay of the chopper. She throws his chair in, and
          jumps in herself.
          
                                JAKE
                      Go! Go! Go!
          
                                                                     114.
          
          
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - NIGHT
          
          QUARITCH, watching a monitor, sees what's happening down at
          the airfield. He slams his palm down on an ALARM BUTTON.
          
          He draws his PISTOL.   Strides toward the EMERGENCY DOOR. He
          undogs it.
          
          EXT. OPS CENTER/AIRFIELD - NIGHT
          
          HOLDING HIS BREATH Quaritch yanks the hatch open and strides
          onto the outer landing. Inside people scramble for MASKS.
          
          THE SAMSON lifts off in a blast of rotor-wash just as --
          
          QUARITCH OPENS FIRE and --
          
          ROUNDS rake the ship. Trudy banks hard, using the bottom to
          shield them. Bullets WHACK into the ship as she climbs-out
          over the tree-line.
          
          Jake's fist pumps the air exultantly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Oh yeah, baby!
          
                              GRACE
                    Aaahh, crap. Not again.
          
          He looks over at Grace and freezes. She is looking down at a
          BLOODY HAND. She clutches her abdomen, covering the
          spreading stain. Looks at Jake, wide-eyed.
          
                              GRACE
                    This is gonna ruin my whole day.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hang on, Grace.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          NORM'S AVATAR, with an AR slung over his shoulder, stands on
          the roof of the LINK MODULE. He gives a thumbs up signal.
          The lift cable goes taut and --
          
          The shack LIFTS OFF THE GROUND.
          
          Trudy's Samson beats the grass of the mountain meadow,
          straining to lift the module on a long-line sling. The shack
          sways as Trudy banks across forested slopes and heads deeper
          into the HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.
          
                                                                    115.

          Outside the windows, clouds and cliffs pass by, lit by
          Polyphemus.
          
          Jake is yanking stuff out of the Samson's trauma bag, while
          Grace lies curled across two back seats, hugging her blood-
          soaked abdomen. She is pale and shocky.
          
          Trudy is flying on visual only, by the light of Polyphemus.
          Her instruments are showing gibberish.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Well, at least they won't be able to
                    track us up here. Not this deep in the
                    vortex.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's strongest at the Well of Souls,
                    right?
          
                               TRUDY
                    Yeah.
          
                              JAKE
                    Good, `cause that's where we're going.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Copy.
          
          He gives Grace an ampule of morphine for the pain.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.
          
                              GRACE
                    Forget it, it doesn't matter.
          
          Jake grabs her shoulders.
          
                               JAKE
                    No!   The People can help you. I know it.
                                                                   CUT TO:

          the Well of Souls.
          
          Tiny as an insect, the SAMSON passes.

                    The Well of Souls. The heart of the
                    forest. I knew the People would go
                    there.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN
          
          The WELL OF SOULS is a deep caldera 100 meters across. It is
          ringed with enormous WILLOWS whose roots seem to pour down
          the sheer rock walls like candle wax.
          
          AT THE BOTTOM, in a natural amphitheater, the Omaticaya
          refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping
          which forms a kind of dais and altar.
          
          Shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto,
          lighting a single willow -- the MOTHER TREE. Ancient and
          gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock.
          
          Its ROOTS spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge
          with the roots of the willows ringing the Well -- forming a
          braided mat resembling the surface of a brain.
          
          Mo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a CHANT.

          It bumps to the ground.

          Grace lies, comatose, in her open link. Trudy gives Jake a
          look that says "not much time." Jake feels Grace's cold
          forehead, then crosses to his own link.
          
          As Trudy helps him in, Norm rapidly preps the system.

          silent, shrouded in smoke that the sun can't penetrate. The
          animals have fled. Ash blows on the wind.
          
                                  JAKE (V.O.)
                       Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face
                       them again, I was gonna have to change
                       the rules.
          
          DISSOLVE -- JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest
          beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen.
          Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell.
          
          JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles
          through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around
          him.
          
          A SCREECH.    Jake looks up as --
          
          HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in
          front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It
          nudges his chest like a horse.

                       The way I had it figured, Toruk is the
                       baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks
                       him. So why would he ever look up?
          
          FROM ABOVE -- THE SMALL SHADOW of Jake's banshee falls across
          the back of the mighty Toruk.

          looks up, and her eyes go wide as --
          
          A TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward.   AN ENORMOUS
          SHADOW covers the crowd as --
          
          TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow
          its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the
          sun, seem to glow from within.
          
          The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast
          alights in their midst. And that's when they see --
          
          JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its
          antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the
          paralyzed Na'vi.
          
          Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts
          and strokes the magnificent animal's flank.
          
          NEYTIRI, TSU'TEY and MO'AT watch in stunned amazement as the

          Neytiri raises her arms.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SHOUTING)
                    Toruk Macto!
          
          ON THE FACES of the Omaticaya -- new hope dawning in their
          eyes. WHISPERS flow among them, the words REPEATED --
          
                              CROWD
                    Toruk Macto... Toruk Macto...
          
                                                                      119.
          
          
          
          Jake walks through the crowd, straight to Neytiri at the foot
          of the dais. He looks into her enormous eyes, and the
          emotion between them is powerful and pure.
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    I See you.
          
                               JAKE
                        (a hoarse whisper)
                    I See you.
          
          Neytiri's eyes brim with tears.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I was afraid Jake -- for my people. I'm
                    not any more.
          
          Jake takes Neytiri's hand and climbs the steps of the dais.
          
          MO'AT steps back in awe as he approaches. He turns to
          Tsu'tey, who stares at him with fear and incomprehension.
          Jake plays to the rapt crowd as he says --
          
                              JAKE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I
                    stand before you, ready to serve the
                    People.
                        (then just for Tsu'tey)
                    You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best
                    warrior. I can't do this without you.
          
          Tsu'tey struggles with his emotions. Finally --
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I will fly with you.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Ireiyo.
          
          JAKE turns to the MATRIARCH.
          
                              JAKE
                    Grace is dying.     I beg the help of the
                    Great Mother.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Bring her, Jakesully.
          
          TIME CUT -- AVATAR JAKE carries Grace's HUMAN BODY, lightly
          in his arms like a child. Jake walks through the crowd to
          the dais, followed by NORM, who carries GRACE'S AVATAR.
          
                                                                   120.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    Look where we are, Grace.
          
          Her eyes flutter open. She looks up wonderingly at the Mother
          Tree.
          
                              GRACE
                        (with a wan smile)
                    I need to take some samples.
          
          Mo'at directs them to lay both bodies among the roots on the
          altar-rock.
          
          Mo'at touches Jake's shoulder and he steps back.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (QUIETLY)
                    The Great Mother may choose to save all
                    that she is --
          
          Mo'at's hand indicates Grace's AVATAR --
          
                              MO'AT
                    -- in this body.
          
          CU JAKE, realizing the enormity of what she's saying.
          
                              JAKE
                    Is that possible?
          
                              MO'AT
                    Possible, yes. She must pass through the
                    Eye of Eywa -- and return. But Jakesully--
                    she is very weak.
          
          Jake kneels next to Grace, taking her tiny human hand in his
          avatar hand.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hang on, they're gonna fix you up.
          
          Grace is barely conscious.    She grips his hand.
          
                              GRACE
                    I -- always held back. But you gave them
                    your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake.
          
          Jake feels his throat close with emotion.
          
          Grace's eyes blaze with intensity though her voice is faint.
          
                                                                     121.
          
          
          
                                 GRACE
                    Help them.     You do whatever it takes. You
                    hear me?
          
                                 JAKE
                    I will.
          
          TIME CUT -- MO'AT stands in a kind of trance amongst the
          tendrils of the Mother Tree.
          
          NEYTIRI and the other acolytes dance hypnotically. All the
          Omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums.
          
          MACRO SHOT -- fine, hairlike THREADS have emerged from the
          roots and are gently spreading over Grace's HUMAN skin.
          
          JAKE, still holding her hand, watches her body being fused to
          the root-floor by a thousand connections.
          
          GRACE'S AVATAR is gently connected by the same questing ROOT-
          CILIA-- they entwine with the QUEUE and spread over the body.
          
          The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the
          willows. The CHANT continues, hypnotically. MO'AT, on her
          knees beneath the Mother Tree, writhes her arms in the trance
          state. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only WHITE.
          
          GRACE GASPS and her eyes SNAP OPEN. Her expression is AMAZED,
          as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be
          explained.
          
          ON HER HAND -- GRIPPING Jake's convulsively, as she tries to
          anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds --
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm with her Jake --
                        (an amazed whisper)
                    -- she's real --
          
          Grace SHUDDERS, as pain shoots through her. BLOOD seeps
          through the silken white root-cilia growing across her
          abdomen. Drowning WHITE in shocking CRIMSON.
          
          She exhales a last shuddering breath -- and goes STILL.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Grace!
          
          He sees the roots falling away from her human body.
          
          JAKE TURNS hopefully toward her AVATAR -- but the roots are
          falling away from it as well. It sleeps -- VACANT.
          
                                                                       122.
          
          
          
          MO'AT stops the chant. She crosses to Jake and kneels with
          him, touching his shoulder.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Her wounds were too great, there was not
                    enough time. She is with Eywa now.
          
          NEYTIRI removes Grace's mask and gently closes her eyes.
          
          Jake stands slowly, barely holding it together.
          
          NEYTIRI comes to him and he sees the despair and hope
          conflicting on her face --
          
          -- and he raises his head.   TURNS to face TSU'TEY and the
          CROWD.
          
                              JAKE
                    With your permission, I will Speak now.
                    You would honor me by translating.
          
          Tsu'tey gestures assent, and they face the clan together.
          
          JAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Grace's death in the passion and
          fury of his voice. Tsu'tey TRANSLATES beside him.
          
                              JAKE
                    The Sky People have sent a message that
                    they can take whatever they want, and no
                    one can stop them. But we will send them
                    a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind
                    can carry you, tell the other clans to
                    come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to
                    them. Fly now with me brothers and
                    sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky
                    People that this is our land!
          
          TSU'TEY finishes with a bloodcurdling war-cry, and the entire
          CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest.
          
          JAKE takes Neytiri's hand and runs to the leonopteryx.   He
          vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him.
          
          THE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jake's
          leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a
          thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it.
          
          LONG LENS -- POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise
          like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different
          directions.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
                                                                    123.
          
          
          
          EXT. CLAN GATHERING - NIGHT
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI stand before the gathered members of ANOTHER
          CLAN. Jake speaks as she translates. We don't hear the
          words.
          
          TRACK ACROSS the faces of the clan, a sea of eyes in
          flickering fire-light.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    We rode out to the four winds. To the
                    horse clans of the plain, to the ikran
                    people of the mountains. When Toruk
                    Macto called them, they came.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES -- SLOW MOTION as riders vault onto their
          armored direhorses. Banshee riders raise spears and bows,
          spurring their mounts to leap skyward.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN
          
          With a WHOOSH and the crack of mighty wings, JAKE RETURNS.
          Jake and Neytiri alight from his legendary mount.
          
          Around them HUNDREDS OF BANSHEES are landing.   A gathering of
          eagles.
          
          FROM ABOVE we can see hundreds of Na'vi streaming down into
          the Well of Souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest
          above it.
          
          DIREHORSE RIDERS are arriving along many trails.
          
          BANSHEE RIDERS circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the
          grotto.
          
          JAKE, standing next to the Leonopteryx, watches his army
          gathering.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMISSARY - DAY
          
          It's standing room only as all base personnel are crowded
          into the dining hall. A portable 3D GRAPHICS PROJECTOR has
          been set up, and the lights are down. QUARITCH stands in
          front of the display image -- a classic pre-mission briefing.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    People, you are fighting for survival.
                    There's an aboriginal horde out there
                    massing for an attack. First slide.
          
                                                                      124.
          
          
          
          The display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls.    It
          looks like Woodstock in the jungle.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    These orbital images show the hostiles'
                    numbers have gone from a couple of
                    hundred to over two thousand in one day,
                    and more are pouring in. By next week it
                    could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be
                    overrunning our perimeter here. We can't
                    wait. Our only security lies in pre-
                    emptive attack. We will fight terror
                    with terror.
          
          TRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers.
          Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Next slide. This mountain stronghold is
                    supposedly protected by their deity.
                    When we destroy it, we will blast a
                    crater in their racial memory so deep
                    they won't come within a thousand klicks
                    of this place.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY - DAY
          
          TROOPERS issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line
          of mine workers. The miners lock and load like the red-
          blooded redneck NRA supporters they are.
          
          BLASTING TECHS are setting radio-detonated primer charges
          into two-ton stacks of EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. The stacks are
          band-strapped together on pallets.
          
          TRACKING WITH SELFRIDGE, staring around him in growing dismay
          as he walks through the full-scale mobilization.
          
          He approaches Quaritch, who is barking orders amid a hive of
          activity around the ampsuits.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    This thing is completely out of control!
          
          Quaritch ignores him, turning away to focus on ordnance
          loading.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to
                    turn the mine-workers local into a
                    freakin' militia!
          
                                                                     125.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I declared threat condition red. That
                    puts all on-world assets under my
                    command.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You think you can pull this palace coup
                    shit on me?! I can have your ass with
                    one call --
          
          Quaritch grabs him and PINS him against the side of an
          ampsuit.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You're a long way from Earth.
          
          Selfridge is paralyzed. Physical force -- against him?
          Quaritch releases him and walks away.
          
                              QUARITCH
                        (to his men)
                    Get him out of here.
          
          Several troopers converge on Selfridge.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You touch me you're so fired.
          
          He pushes through them and they escort him toward the door.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - DAY
          
          HUMAN JAKE, NORM and TRUDY are gathered around the comms
          monitor, talking to MAX.
          
                              MAX
                    I don't know how secure this channel is.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Talk fast.
          
                              MAX
                    It's crazy here, Jake. It's full
                    mobilization. They're rigging the
                    shuttles as bombers. They've made up
                    these big pallets of mine explosives.
                    It's for some kind of shock and awe
                    campaign.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Frickin' daisycutters.

                    Holy shit.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Max)
                    Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can
                    cut some kinda deal before this thing
                    goes all the way.
          
                              MAX
                    No, Quaritch has taken over. He's
                    rolling and there's no stopping him.
          
                                 JAKE
                    When?
          
                              MAX
                    Oh six hundred tomorrow.
          
          Jake takes that in.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Thanks.
          
          Max signs off.
          
                              NORM
                    We're screwed.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You know he's gonna commit those bombers
                    straight to the Well of Souls.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right. Because I gave it to him
                    on a plate.
          
                              TRUDY
                    We both did.
          
                              NORM
                    If he takes out the Well of Souls -- it's
                    over. It's their main line to Eywa, to
                    their ancestors -- it'll destroy them.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then I guess we better stop him.
          
          Jake looks like he's about to collapse.   He's gaunt, eyes
          deeply shadowed, hands shaking.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You need to get some rack.
          
                                                                      127.
          
          
          
          He grabs a packet of freeze-dried crystals and pours them
          directly into his mouth, chewing them up.
          
                              JAKE
                    Gonna have to settle for coffee.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. BATTLE CAMP - DUSK
          
          TRACKING through the warrior camp above the Well of Souls.
          Hundreds of hunters from many clans prepare their weapons.
          
          Hunters paint the wings of their banshees like war ponies.
          DIREHORSES are painted and ornamented with totemic streamers.
          
          The Na'vi paint and pierce themselves. Dance. Bathe in the
          smoke of cleansing herbs -- RITUAL PURIFICATION. HUGE DRUMS
          are beaten. A dark primeval energy. They are psyching
          themselves up for battle.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I was a warrior who dreamed he could
                    bring peace. But there was only one
                    thing I was ever really good at. Ooh-rah.
          
          TIME CUT -- Jake, Neytiri a group of banshee riders squat
          around an animal skin on which he has drawn the silhouette of
          a Scorpion gunship -- like a hunt totem.
          
                              JAKE
                        (Na'vi/subtitled)
                    Strike here and here.
          
          Jake splats red dye at the centers of the circles symbolizing
          the rotors. The Na'vi absorb the lesson eagerly, like kids.
          
          He sees TRUDY approaching and breaks off. Neytiri stays with
          the hunters, talking about what they've learned.
          
                              TRUDY
                        (LOW)
                    You know our chances suck.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Going up against gunships with bows and
                    arrows...
          
                              JAKE
                    What's your point?
          
                                                                      128.
          
          
          
                              TRUDY
                        (NODDING)
                    Right.
          
          She taps his fist and walks away toward her SAMSON.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT
          
          The cook-fires of the battle camp FLICKER like a
          constellation around the edge of the Well of Souls as --
          
          JAKE slips down into the darkened, empty amphitheater.
          
          He moves to the MOTHER TREE -- gnarled, ancient, MAJESTIC.
          The roots spread in all directions, like the center of the
          world.
          
          Jake steps forward. The willow-like tendrils SWAY toward
          him, moving in a breeze that isn't there.
          
                              JAKE
                    I've never done this in my life.
          
          He squats at the base of the tree.
          
                              JAKE
                    And I'm probably just talking to a tree
                    right now. But if you're there -- I need
                    to give you a heads up.
          
          He looks up into the tree. The hanging tendrils undulate
          softly. It's easy to imagine a presence.
          
                              JAKE
                    If Grace is there with you -- look in her
                    memories -- she can show you the world we
                    come from. There's no green there. They
                    killed their Mother, and they're gonna do
                    the same thing here.
          
          FROM UP IN THE TREE, looking down.   WOODSPRITES float in
          silence, moving around aimlessly.
          
                              JAKE
                    More Sky People are gonna come. They're
                    gonna come like a rain that never ends --
          
          Neytiri approaches silently behind him, listening.
          
                              JAKE
                    -- until they've covered the world.
                    Unless we stop them.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                      129.
          
                              JAKE (cont'd)
                    Look, you chose me for somethin'. And
                    I'll stand and fight, you know I will.
                    But I could use a little help here.
          
          Jake senses Neytiri and turns.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Our Great Mother does not take sides.
                    She protects only the balance of life.
          
          She comes to him, intertwining her long fingers with his.
          
                              JAKE
                    It was worth a try.
          
          They lean in, foreheads touching, bodies pressed together.
          Holding each other -- in this, the last moment of peace.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          TIGHT ON a turbine as it starts to turn. Its RISING WHINE
          carries over --
          
          A SERIES OF RHYTHMIC CUTS:
          
          MAGAZINES are slammed into automatic weapons. AMMO BELTS are
          fed into rotary cannons. MISSILES are attached to gunship
          stub-wings.
          
          TIGHT ON BLUE HANDS sharpening wooden arrows.   Stringing
          bows. Cinching direhorse harnesses.
          
          TROOPERS DROP into ampsuit cockpits. PILOTS close gunship
          canopies. TROOPERS run up shuttle ramps.
          
          LONG LENS STACK, tight and abstract on gunships as they rise
          in a swarm amid boiling turbine exhaust and blasting rotor
          wash.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST/ AERIAL - DAWN
          
          WIDE SHOT -- TILTROTORS fill the sky. Deadly armored beetles.
          
          The DRAGON leads the formation, flanked by SCORPIONS. Behind
          that is a wave of SAMSONS, and last, the two enormous
          VALKYRIE shuttles, packed with troops and ampsuits.
          
          INSIDE THE DRAGON, Quaritch surveys his armada as they skim
          over the tree tops.
          
          THEY SWEEP toward the Hallelujah mountains in a thundering
          wave.
          
                                                                     130.
          
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL - DAWN
          
          SQUADRONS OF BANSHEES darken the sky in waves, led by a
          single GREAT LEONOPTERYX. Jake sits astride his mount,
          flanked by Neytiri and Tsu'tey on their banshees.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN
          
          THE DRAGON DESCENDS on final approach to a large clearing --
          the LZ. The Samsons flair and touch down, disgorging troops,
          while the gunships hover protectively.
          
          THE VALKYRIES blast the ground with their powerful lift jets.
          They land. The ramps drop. Troopers pour out, weapons
          leveled, advancing in a cordon.
          
          UP ANGLE as AMPSUITS descend from the Dragon on cables.
          Their massive feet smash down, and they march forward,
          leading the army into the forest.
          
          LYLE WAINFLEET, walking point in his hydraulic suit, scans
          his cockpit screens. He sees movement on the FLIR display --
          ghostly THERMAL SIGNATURES.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Contact. Two hundred meters.
          
          A chilling SOUND echoes through the forest -- the ululating
          WAR CRIES of untold Na'vi. The troopers, look around,
          spooked. They can't tell where the sound is coming from.
          
          Then they feel it -- the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING.    They grip
          their weapons, bracing themselves as --
          
          THREE HUNDRED NA'VI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a
          full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an
          awesome sight.
          
          NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na'vi hunters, carrying an
          assault rifle.
          
          THE NA'VI CHARGE thunders toward the human line.   The hunters
          raise their bows as --
          
          THE AMPSUITS raise their GAU-90's.
          
          ON THE THERMAL IMAGERS target-cursors track the ghost riders.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Fire for effect.
          
          The entire line of troopers opens fire. TRACERS riddle the
          jungle, blasting foliage into confetti.
          
                                                                      131.
          
          
          
          CHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are
          flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are
          decimated as --
          
          RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their
          marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto.
          
          TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them
          like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit,
          FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory
          is short lived as the two riders are cut down.
          
          NORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the
          creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as --
          
          A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut
          down. It SLAMS through an ampsuit's canopy but --
          
          THE MERCILESS FIRE continues. Horses rear and collapse.
          Riders pivot their mounts to flee and --
          
          THE THERMAL SCREENS show the remaining ghost riders
          scattering.
          
          LYLE signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at
          moving targets.
          
          OVERHEAD, NA'VI HUNTERS stream through the trees, running
          along the branches.
          
          As the troopers advance into bow range, the NA'VI open fire
          and --
          
          TROOPERS SPROUT ARROWS in throat, legs, masks -- the targets
          Jake taught them, but --
          
          THE FIRING LINE aims upward, tracking the THERMAL TARGETS.
          TRACERS rip through the foliage and --
          
          NA'VI FALL while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted
          off the limbs beneath their feet.
          
          NORM sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his
          HANDSET --
          
                               NORM
                    Jake!   Jake! We're falling back!
          
          SURVIVING NA'VI flee the horrific onslaught.   It is a total
          rout.
          
          IN THE DRAGON, Quaritch catches glimpses of the figures
          streaming through the forest below.
          
                                                                      132.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Blue team, switch forties.   Fire at will.
          
          Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm
          ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts.
          Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle --
          
          STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi
          leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught.
          
          HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The
          downblast of the VALKYRIE'S lift jets shreds the forest.
          
          INSIDE THE SHUTTLE'S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are
          lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp.
          
          THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and --
          
          BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge
          hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out
          across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions.
          
          AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are
          blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves.
          
          IN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and high-five.
          
                                 TROOPERS
                    Yeah baby!     Get some!
          
          GROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, AR's and GAU-
          90's.
          
          EXT. FLOATING MOUNTAINS - AERIAL
          
          Quaritch's fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of
          Truth.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Blue team, stay with the ground units.
                    Red team, with me. We're punching for
                    the main target.
          
          Quaritch glances up to see --
          
          A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare
          like birds of prey.
          
          CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as
          he leads the charge and --
          
          SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like
          falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined.
          
                                                                      133.
          
          
          
          JAKE'S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X
          shape just before --
          
          K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around
          the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE
          can barely hang onto the gyrating creature.
          
          The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into
          his canopy.   Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a
          CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees.
          There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
          
          SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee
          riders, FIRING cannons and rockets.
          
          JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with
          cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.
          
          JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds
          splitting the air around him and --
          
          The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as
          they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive
          down into the trees.
          
          DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like
          Messerschmidts from a B-17 as --
          
          WE FOLLOW TSU'TEY'S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops
          in from its blind spot and --
          
          THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu'tey flashes past them,
          SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
          
          A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to-
          air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
          
          WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and
          dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns
          and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of
          smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.
          
          IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire --
          tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the
          stub-wing pods.
          
          NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her.   A Scorpion is
          right on her ass as --
          
          SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons
          Veritatis, then rolls out, zig-zagging through the dangling
          vines but --
          
                                                                     134.
          
          
          
          THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and
          tracers FLASH toward us as --
          
          SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but --
          
          HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It
          launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving.
          The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the
          shock wave.
          
          THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons
          Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot
          rolled up on their sides and --
          
          THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but --
          
          A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson
          demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and --
          
          K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it
          downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
          and teeth as they fall together out of control.
          
          Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick,
          breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
          
          FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it.
          This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a
          breathing mask. The door gunners wave at --
          
          TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the
          cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship
          with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.
          
          The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You're not the only ones with guns, you
                    pricks.
          
          NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind
          her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the
          trees, under the canopy.
          
          They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang
          half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around
          Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
          
          THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot
          follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse
          of blue-skinned figures.
          
          THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --
          
                                                                     135.
          
          
          
          The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT
          backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor.
          KABOOM!!
          
          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a
          broken kite, crashing down through branches and --
          
          SHE SLAMS into the ground, stunned.
          
          IN THE DRAGON Quaritch looks ahead, seeing the WELL OF SOULS.
          He taps the pilot and points --
          
                              QUARITCH
                    There it is.
                        (into his headset)
                    Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is
                    in sight.
          
          IN THE CARGO BAY of Valkyrie One, the troopers ready their
          deadly loads.
          
                              TROOPER
                    Target in sight.
          
          CIRCLING ABOVE, Tsu'tey falls in beside Jake, who talks to
          him by AIRCOM HEADSET.
          
                              JAKE
                    We have to stop the shuttles, no matter
                    what it takes.
          
          TSU'TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall
          in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but --
          
          A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as --
          
          TSU'TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink
          and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.
          
          GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
          the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
          
          TSU'TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His
          mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and --
          
          WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and --
          
          A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching
          at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
          
          NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest
          floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s
          rip the forest to shreds.
          
                                                                     136.
          
          
          
          Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar
          body mortally wounded as --
          
          HYDRAULIC FEET approach, passing the bodies of direhorses and
          Na'vi hunters. Norm painfully tries to load another
          magazine, panting in fear and pain as --
          
          AN AMPSUIT stomps up.    Aims its cannon point blank. B-BLAM!
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          The top of Norm's LINK bangs open. He reels out, collapsing
          onto the floor, clutching himself as if he can still feel the
          pain of death.
          
          He sits, huddled, shivering -- crazed.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST
          
          TSU'TEY lies gasping, mortally injured. He looks up,
          grimacing, as an ampsuit looms over him.
          
          LYLE WAINFLEET reaches down and grabs Tsu'tey by his queue,
          lifting him painfully.
          
                                 WAINFLEET
                       I hear this is worse than death for you,
                       chief.
          
          WAINFLEET cuts Tsu'tey's queue off near the base. TSU'TEY
          SCREAMS in agony, his nervous system exploding on overload.
          Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue -- Tsu'tey's only
          connection to the world-consciousness which is his life.
          
          NEYTIRI -- bleeding, bruised -- staggers amid burning
          wreckage. AMPSUIT footsteps approach and she crouches behind
          a tree. Troopers are seconds from seeing her as --
          
          NEYTIRI knocks an arrow to HER FATHER'S BOW, and readies
          herself for a last kamikaze shot when --
          
          THE TROOPER on the far right of the firing line sees
          something on his screens.
          
                                 TROOPER
                       Right flank -- something's coming!   It's
                       all lit up out there.
          
          The troopers become aware of the GROUND SHAKING. A slow
          building thunderous ROAR and --
          
          AN AMPSUIT comes FLYING out of the trees, cartwheeling past
          them, and the SHAKING BUILDS --
          
                                                                      137.
          
          
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS
          
          Mo'at opens her eyes in sudden realization as --
          
          EXT. FOREST
          
          The troopers pivot to face --
          
          A WALL OF CHARGING HAMMERHEADS CRASHING out of the foliage in
          a shower of broken branches as --
          
          THE TROOPERS open fire but -- the stampede drives over them
          like a wave. Tree-trunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits.
          Troopers are crushed or asphyxiated.
          
          NEARBY the foot-soldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the
          gloom as --
          
          VIPERWOLVES race among them with flashing jaws. The troopers
          FIRE wildly as they go down, hitting each other as much as
          their attackers.
          
          The survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of
          the shadows.
          
          JAKE BANKS, watching as HUNDREDS of rider-less WILD BANSHEES
          converge on Quaritch's ships. They literally darken the sky.
          
                              JAKE
                    What the hell -- ?
          
          The wild banshees wheel among the ships, ripping into them.
          
          ON JAKE -- slowly getting it.   EYWA is in the fight.
          
                              JAKE
                    WHOO-HOOOO!
          
          A GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH
          and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking
          him out. Other banshees tear at the pilot's windshield.
          
          NEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in
          disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her.
          
          She senses something and turns slowly to see --
          
          A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening
          black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze--
          
          -- and the thanator lowers itself, until its head is just
          above the ground. It holds that position -- waiting.
          
                                                                    138.
          
          
          
          Trembling, she approaches the waiting demon.
          
          EXT. FOREST
          
          A smoky hell. Fires burn all around. The troopers are
          disorganized, falling back. Shooting at shadows. Panicked
          yelling fills the comm freq.
          
          WAINFLEET and another AMPSUIT are charging together through
          the smoky gloom.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    A and C squads -- rally at my pos.   I
                    want --
                        (screaming on the comm)
                    Who's screaming God damn it?!
          
                              TROOPER (ON RADIO)
                    We gotta get outta here! Whoever's in
                    charge, call for extraction!
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Shutup you crybabies!
          
          SOMETHING slams into the other `suit, tackling it OUT OF
          FRAME. Wainfleet whirls to see his squad-mate missing. He
          moves through a screen of foliage to reveal --
          
          The AMPSUIT -- ripped open. Driver gone. Blood inside the
          cockpit. He WHIRLS at a sound in time to see --
          
          A THANATOR LEAPING straight at him -- WAINFLEET raises his
          cannon but--
          
          WHAM!! It's on him, slamming him to the ground. The cannon
          goes flying. He's face to face with its nightmare jaws,
          right outside his canopy--
          
          On its back is NEYTIRI, and it's a toss up which one looks
          more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling
          as it poises to strike and --
          
          K-KRAAACKK! Slams its teeth right through his canopy.
          Wainfleet's SCREAM is brief.
          
          Neytiri's demon mount rears up and its triumphant ROAR echoes
          through the forest.
          
          INT. CORRIDOR
          
          Max runs down the hall, leading the other scientists.   He's
          yelling into an AIRCOM HANDSET --
          
                                                                   139.

                           (to the scientists)
                       Get in there. Barricade the door!
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          The door is hurled open and the SCIENTISTS charge in.
          
          Science geeks barricade the door as AVATAR-DRIVERS scramble
          into their link units, pulling the clamshells down.
          
          INT. CORRIDOR
          
          Max checks the door is secure from his side then runs down a
          connecting corridor.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SHACK
          
          HUMAN NORM emerges from the airlock, wearing breathing gear
          and carrying an AR. He stumbles, dazed, toward the battle.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL
          
          JAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at
          the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged
          creatures.
          
          THE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Na'vi
          hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves,
          overwhelming the troopers.
          
          HUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in.
          They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and
          troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage.
          
          The panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to
          close, a second before he is cut down by a spear.
          
          JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He
          swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and
          lands, tumbling on the shuttle's broad back as --
          
          GUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them
          with his AR, still running forward and --
          
          JAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the
          pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of
          the VTOL turbofans as --
          
          HIS LEONOPTERYX BANKS in a tight arc back toward him and --
          
                                                                      140.
          
          
          
          HE SPRINTS ON as the grenades EXPLODE, shattering the
          turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and --
          
          JAKE LEAPS INTO SPACE, landing on the back of his mount and
          reconnecting. They flap away, gaining altitude as fire
          BLASTS out of the bottom of the shuttle.
          
          ON THE FLIGHT DECK, the pilot feels the ship dropping.
          
                               PILOT
                     Mains to a hundred percent!   Get me
                     airspeed!
          
          The pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and --
          
          The FUSION ENGINES BLAZE, thrusting the shuttle forward.    It
          still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until --
          
          IT'S CLIPPING the tree tops when it gets enough translational
          lift to fly and --
          
          THE PILOT PULLS back on the stick, lifting the nose.
          
                               PILOT
                     We're good!
          
          BEHIND HIM, a surviving Na'vi hunter runs forward and --
          
          THOONK!   ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots' necks and chests.
          
          THE SHUTTLE CLIMBS out of control, at full acceleration. It
          SLAMS into the underside of MONS Veritatis. It EXPLODES, and
          hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest.
          
          ON THE FLIGHT DECK of the other SHUTTLE, the pilots watch the
          wreckage falling.
          
                               PILOT
                     Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any
                     of ya'll want to get off this piece of
                     shit planet, you better cover our ass,
                     `cause we're the only way back to orbit.
          
                               GUNSHIP PILOT
                     Roger that.
          
          FROM THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches the shuttle bank
          away, with most of the remaining gunships following.
          
                               QUARITCH
                     Get back here you worthless pukes!

                              PILOT
                    Are we breaking off?
          
          Quaritch draws his pistol.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    What do you think?
          
          He is over the edge-- no logic in his brain now.   Only death.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER/CORRIDOR
          
          Techs and troopers crowd around consoles, listening to all
          the yelling and confusion as they try to plot the
          disintegrating battle.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                        (in growing alarm)

          INT. DRAGON COCKPIT
          
          The pilot listens to comms from Hell's Gate.
          
                              PILOT
                    Sir, all ground units are falling back to
                    the LZ.
          
          Quaritch's jaw clenches.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Stay on target.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS
          
          Mo'at LOOKS UP as the DRAGON appears over the trees like the
          shadow of Death. Around her, the Na'vi mothers clutch their
          children to them. We see AKWEY'S BOY among them.
          
          INT. DRAGON COCKPIT
          
          Quaritch sets the target cursor on the MOTHER TREE and what
          we recognize is the ghostly figure of Mo'at.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Switch missiles. Arm all pods.
          
                                                                      142.

                      Let's see what these blue bastards do
                      when I bitch-slap their goddess.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL
          
          JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX drops toward the Dragon like a Mig 29.     He
          pulls out, skimming over the ship. Uncoupling, he rolls
          backward off his mount and --
          
          JAKE HITS, skidding, on the hull of the Dragon. He rolls to
          his feet, already running as --
          
          QUARITCH sees the leonopteryx WHOOSH overhead and flap away
          with no rider. He snap-looks aft to see --
          
          JAKE SPRINTING along the spine of the ship, yanking two
          grenades from his battle-harness, pulling the pins with his
          teeth, then --
          
          QUARITCH's hand shoots out and SLAMS the pilot's CYCLIC STICK
          hard over. THE DRAGON lurches sideways, rolling sharply with
          a ROAR of protesting rotors and --
          
          JAKE IS FLUNG off his feet. The grenades miss the TURBINE
          INTAKES. One bounces off the ship. The other lodges against
          a cowling and --
          
          JAKE SLIDES OFF the ship, falling as -- K-BLAM! The grenade
          blows a two meter hole in the hull --
          
          WHOOOSHH!   Pandoran air swirls inside.
          
                                QUARITCH
                          (to the pilot)
                      Put your mask on.
          
          Quaritch leaps out of his seat, heading aft as --
          
          JAKE GRABS the edge of a weapons pod, his feet dangling over
          open space.
          
          HOLDING HIS BREATH, Quaritch blows a RESCUE HATCH and leans
          outside. Jake sees him aim his massive PISTOL.
          
          K-WHAM! K-WHAM! Rounds clang next to Jake's head. He LETS GO,
          plummeting into the trees --
          
          Jake plunges through jungle canopy. He catches a HUGE LEAF,
          as Neytiri taught him -- it bends down, breaking his fall --
          
                                                                     143.
          
          
          
          HE LETS GO, dropping again only to catch ANOTHER LEAF, and
          then another, and --
          
          WE RUSH DOWN with him through this green blur.   Jake drops to
          the ground in a feral crouch. Unhurt.
          
                              JAKE
                        (into his headset)
                    Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of
                    Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him,
                    anybody that can! Do it now!
          
          IN HER SAMSON Trudy Chacon is all business.

                    On it.
          
          SHE BANKS hard, pulling g's, coming around on the Dragon.
          She pours on the coal and the Samson leaps forward, straight
          at the WARSHIP.
          
          QUARITCH, DRILLS a stream of tracers at her, tearing through
          her canopy, ripping chunks off her fuselage.
          
          IN THE JUNGLE BELOW, Norm watches her kamikaze run --
          
                              NORM
                    No!

                        (clipped, pilot-like)
                    Norm, I love you.
          
          TRUDY DIVES, raking through treetops and then, at the last
          instant, YANKS BACK on the stick and --
          
          THE SAMSON leaps straight up and -- K-KRASH!! SHEARS OFF THE
          COCKPIT of the Dragon as --
          
          QUARITCH THROWS HIMSELF aft along the aisle and --
          
          TRUDY'S SAMSON disintegrates, the wreckage burning as it
          tumbles into the jungle.
          
          MILES QUARITCH grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open
          front of the fuselage. Wind howls through wreckage where the
          pilot used to be. The forest rushes up to meet him and --
          
          THE DRAGON CRASHES through splintering trees, IMPACTING in a
          lake with a WHITE BLAST of water.
          
                                                                      144.

                      Dragon is down. It's off the board.

                      What do you mean, off the board?!
          
          Selfridge is stunned.    Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes
          them all look up.
          
          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH-
          CUTTER. Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever
          forward --
          
                                 SELFRIDGE
                      Oh shit.
          
          Selfridge DIVES as --
          
          K-RASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASH-CUTTER tear
          through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms
          go off. The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of
          glass and shredded debris.
          
          The slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE
          through the gaping hole into the Ops Center --
          
          The TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down
          at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are
          holding the Ops Center.
          
          Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask.   In
          shock. How could this be happening?
                                                                   CUT TO:

          THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape
          rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face
          bloody, his eyes burning.
          
          He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides
          into the forest.
          
                                                                      145.
          
          
          
          QUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle.    He
          sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK.
          
          INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a
          window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing.
          
          QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to
          the firing button--
          
          WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.
          
          Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses
          Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its
          razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.
          
          THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long
          burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which
          SHRIEKS but --
          
          NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock,
          tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but --
          
          Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost
          crushing Neytiri.
          
          CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE
          and --
          
          QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the
          thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips
          on top of it, stabbing.
          
          QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning
          Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped.
          
          Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him,
          panting, scared but defiant.
          
                              JAKE (O.S.)
                    It's all over Quaritch --
          
          Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The
          `suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Nothing's over while I'm breathing.
          
                              JAKE
                    Kinda hoped you'd say that.
          
          QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the
          broken CANNON as --
          
                                                                      146.
          
          
          
          Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries,
          blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit
          can move and --
          
          K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy,
          crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with
          the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash
          and --
          
          SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again
          -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.
          
          QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away.
          Jake rolls just before --
          
          THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He
          scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and --
          
          JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the
          canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks.
          Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but --
          
          INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the
          shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks.
          The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --
          
          FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing
          it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside.
          
          INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --
          
          P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air.
          Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to
          pick up his KNIFE.
          
          NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs
          free from underneath three tons of thanator.
          
          QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    How does it feel to betray your own race?
          
          Then, inexplicably, he TURNS.   Walks away.
          
          FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us
          and --
          
          CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the
          window. He is reaching inside for the Link when --
          
          JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he
          has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and --
          
                                                                      147.
          
          
          
          JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder
          and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge
          of the cockpit but --
          
          QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake
          slams to the ground.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic
          Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK.
          
          NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull
          her other leg out.
          
          THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and --
          
          JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of
          the attack drives him to his knees as --
          
          QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is
          pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay
          connected as --
          
          THE KNIFE reaches his throat as --
          
          THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch's chest.   He looks up.
          
          NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure,
          she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.
          
          TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
          
          QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches
          the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic
          laugh -- he dies.
          
          NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing
          Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow.
          
          JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and --
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          HUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor
          where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws
          toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room.
          
          He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness.
          
          NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the
          debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake's
          side -- puts the mask over his face and --
          
                                                                    148.
          
          
          
          JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri,
          studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for
          the first time.
          
          Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue
          of her skin. There eyes meet across the glass of the mask --
          together, separate. Worldless.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          MO'AT tends to the mortally wounded TSU'TEY as AVATAR JAKE
          arrives with Neytiri. Mo'at has bound his wounds, but by her
          expression, it is clear he cannot be saved.
          
          Jake kneels and Tsu'tey opens his eyes.   Through a haze of
          pain, he recognizes Jake.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (NA'VI)
                    I See you, Jakesully.
          
                              JAKE
                    I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Are the people safe?
          
                              JAKE
                    They're safe.
          
          Tsu'tey weakly clutches his severed queue.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                    I can never ride again, or bond with my
                    woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can
                    not lead the People. You will lead them,
                    Jakesully.
          
                              JAKE
                    No. I'm not officer material.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    It is decided. Now do the duty of
                    Olo'eyctan. Set my spirit free.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm not killing you.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I am already dead.
          
                                                                     149.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    No.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    It is the way. And it is good. I will be
                    remembered --
          
          Tsu'tey's voice is weak, but thick with emotion.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    -- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were
                    brothers -- and he was my last shadow.
          
          TSU'TEY'S HAND clasps with Jake's in a fierce grip. Jake
          draws his knife.
          
          TSU'TEY'S POV -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun.
          HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu'tey.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NA'VI)
                    Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the
                    Mother Spirit.
          
          By his movement, we know that he has ended Tsu'tey's pain.
          Jake's eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the
          prayer for the dead, and his Na'vi words carry over as we --
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. HELL'S GATE -DAY
          
          Na'vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell's
          Gate.
          
          Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats
          flutter about, unimpeded. The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and
          the GATES are open to the forest.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.
          
          Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold AR's as the
          personnel of Hell's Gate file up the cargo ramp of the
          remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry,
          like POW's.
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of
          the Sky People.
          
          PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp. His eyes -- the eyes
          of a lost soul -- meet JAKE'S. He disappears into the ship.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. SPACE
          
          ISV VENTURE STAR hangs suspended against the dark side of
          PANDORA. The ISV's antimatter engines BLAZE to life and it
          accelerates out of orbit.
          
          What remains IN FRAME is a virgin, primeval world. Spanning
          the black continents is a vast reticulated lace-work of
          BIOLUMINESCENCE -- a ghostly WEB connecting all of Pandora.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          The sun's rays shaft down through the layers of canopy.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       The forest will heal, and so will the
                       hearts of the People. New life keeps the
                       energy flowing, like the breath of the
                       world.
          
          NEYTIRI, obviously pregnant, is bow-fishing in the shallows.
          Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       This is my last videolog.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          VIDEO IMAGE -- Jake sits in a chair, talking straight TO
          CAMERA. He is thin, pale. He looks around the high tech room.
          
                                 JAKE
                       The science guys will keep the lights on,
                       here. But I won't miss this place.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT
          
          THE WILLOWS glow softly. The entire Omaticaya clan is
          gathered, seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       I better wrap this up. There's a funeral
                       tonight, and I don't want to be late. It
                       was someone very close to me.
          
          WIDE SHOT, moving in across the concentric rings of people,
          all plugged-in and softly chanting. MOVING toward the
          center, over the figure of Mo'at, to hover above --
          
          NEYTIRI, kneeling beside two FIGURES on the dais --
          
                                                                     151.
          
          
          
          JAKE and his AVATAR lie head to head. Human Jake is wearing
          an exomask. Both figures are still, hands folded, covered in
          translucent silken shrouds of ROOT-CILIA.
          
          CAMERA CLOSES IN as Neytiri removes the mask from Jake's
          human face. She gently closes his dead eyes with her
          fingertips. Then bends and kisses him.
          
          MOVE INTO CU on AVATAR JAKE as Neytiri's hand comes into
          frame, stroking his cheek. TIGHTENING slowly to--
          
          ECU JAKE'S EYES. Hold a beat, then --
          
          They open.

          "And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's
          mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a
          common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the
          foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years,
          their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory
          has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers
          Assemble!"

          BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT.
          Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.

          EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE ­ NIGHT

          Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE
          OTHER, bows.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a
           little world. A human world. They would
           wield its power,...

                          CUT TO:
          THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the
          CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem
          encircled with silver blades.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           But our ally knows its workings as they
           never will. He is ready to lead. And
           our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

          HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a
          seething mass of neat rows and columns....the ground simply

          QUAKES.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The world will be his. The universe
           yours. And the humans, what can they do
           but burn?

          EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY ­ NIGHT

          Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS

          Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

          SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

          Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

                          NICK FURY
           How bad is it?

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run
          around, taking only the essentials.

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
           the Tesseract four hours ago.

                          NICK FURY
           NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test
           phase.

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in
           the room. Spontaneous advancement.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL
           It just turned itself on?

                          NICK FURY
           What are the energy levels now?

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it
           down, we ordered the evac.

                          NICK FURY
           How long to get everyone out?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Campus should be clear in the next half
           hour.

                          NICK FURY
           Do better.

          CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, evacuation may be futile.

                          NICK FURY
           We should tell them to go back to
           sleep?

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           If we can't control the Tesseract's
           energy, there may not be a minimum safe
           distance.

                          NICK FURY
           I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
           prototypes are shipped out.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, is that really a priority right
           now?

                          NICK FURY
           Until such time as the world ends, we
           will act as though it intends to spin
           on. Clear out the tech below. Every
           piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.
           (to standing agents)
           With me.

          INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

                          NICK FURY
           Talk to me, doctor.
          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random.

                          SELVIG
           Director.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything we know for certain?

                          SELVIG
           Tesseract is misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           Is that supposed to be funny?

                          SELVIG
           No, it's not funny at all. The
           Tesseract is not only active,
           she's...misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           How soon until you pull the plug?

                          SELVIG
           She's an energy source. If we turn off
           the power, she turns it back on. If she
           reaches peak level...

                          NICK FURY
           We've prepared for this, doctor.
           Harnessing energy from space.

                          SELVIG
           We don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.

                          NICK FURY
           That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

                          SELVIG
           The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

                          NICK FURY
           I gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Well, I see better from a distance.

                          NICK FURY
           Are you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off?

                          NASA SCIENTIST

                          (TO SELVIG)
           Doctor, it's spiking again.

                          CLINT BARTON
           No one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.

                          NICK FURY
           At this end?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

                          NICK FURY
           Sir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

                          LOKI
           You have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

                          LOKI
           Please don't. I still need that.

                          NICK FURY

                          (TURNING)
           This doesn't have to get any messier.

                          LOKI
           Of course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.

                          SELVIG
           Loki? Brother of Thor?

                          NICK FURY
           We have no quarrel with your people.

                          LOKI
           An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

                          NICK FURY
           You planning to step on us?

                          LOKI
           I come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.

                          NICK FURY
           Free from what?

                          LOKI
           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

                          LOKI
           You will know peace.

                          NICK FURY
           Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think
           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.

                          NICK FURY
           Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

                          SELVIG
           He's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.

                          LOKI
           Well, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

                          CLINT BARTON
           (pointing to the Loki team)
           Need these vehicles.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Who's that?

                          CLINT BARTON
           He didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

                          NICK FURY
           (through the walkie talkie)
           Hill, do you copy?!
          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

                          NICK FURY
           Barton is...

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER ­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
          shooting.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is holding his side, running.

                          NICK FURY
           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
          vacuum chamber ceiling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE ­ CONTINUOUS

          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
          but...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No! Leave it!
          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.

          EXT. VAN ­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.

          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ NIGHT

          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

          JULES WINNFIELD.
          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is with the hostile
           force. I have men down. Hill?

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but
          luckily, not her.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           A lot of men still under, don't know
           how many survivors.

          EXT. DESERT ­ NIGHT


                          NICK FURY
           Sound the general call. I want every
           living soul not working rescue looking
           for that brief case.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Roger that.

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson, get back to base. This is a
           LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at
           war.
          A beat.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           What do we do?
          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
          hope.

                         THE AVENGERS

          EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

                          LUCHKOV
           This is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.

                          NATASHA
           I know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.

                          LUCHKOV
           I'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

                          NATASHA
           I thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.

                          LUCHKOV
           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.

                          NATASHA
           You really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

                          LUCHKOV
           We do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

                          WEASELLY THUG
           Ya?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

                          LUCHKOV
           Who the hell is...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to come in.

                          NATASHA
           Are you kidding? I'm working!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This takes precedence.

                          NATASHA
           I'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.

                          LUCHKOV
           I don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.

                          NATASHA
           Look, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.

                          NATASHA
           Let me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.

                          NATASHA
           Where's Barton now?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We don't know.

                          NATASHA
           But he's alive.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We think so. I'll brief you on
           everything when you get back. But
           first, we need you to talk to the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
           about as far as he can throw me.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No, I've got Stark. You get the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Bozhe moi.

          EXT. INDIAN SLUM ­ NIGHT

          A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way
          through.

          INT. SHACK ­ NIGHT

          A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be
          stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.
          BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

                          ATTENDING WOMAN
           What are doing here?! Get out! You
           shouldn't be here!

                          LITTLE GIRL
           I have to see the doctor! It's my
           father!

                          BANNER
           Calm down. What's wrong?

                          LITTLE GIRL
           My father...
          Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few
          people, lying down, looking very sick.

                          BANNER
           Is he like them?
          The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Please.

          EXT. SLUMS ­ CONTINUOUS

          Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of
          town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local
          government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

          EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
          walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
          left standing there like a dumbass.

                          BANNER
           Should have got paid up front, Banner.
          Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
          around, quietly.

                          NATASHA
           You know, for a man who's supposed to
           be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
           of a place to settle.

                          BANNER
           Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

                          NATASHA
           Then, what is it? Yoga?

                          BANNER
           You brought me to the edge of the city,
           smart. I uh... assume the whole place
           is surrounded?

                          NATASHA
           Just you and me.

                          BANNER
           And your actress buddy, is she a spy
           too? Do they start that young?

                          NATASHA
           I did.

                          BANNER
           Who are you?

                          NATASHA
           Natasha Romanoff.

                          BANNER
           Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
           Because that's not gonna work out for
           everyone.

                          NATASHA
           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
           behalf of SHIELD.

                          BANNER
           SHIELD. How did they find me?

                          NATASHA
           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
           our distance, even helped keep some
           other interested parties off your
           scent.

                          BANNER
           Why?

                          NATASHA
           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
           need you to come in.

                          BANNER
           What if I said no?

                          NATASHA
           I'll persuade you.

                          BANNER
           And what if the... other guy says no?

                          NATASHA
           You've been more than a year without an
           incident. I don't think you wanna break
           that streak.

                          BANNER
           I don't always get what I want.

                          NATASHA
           Doctor, we're facing a potential global
           catastrophe.

                          BANNER
           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

                          NATASHA
           This is the Tesseract. It has the
           potential energy to wipe out the
           planet.
          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
          takes a closer look.

                          BANNER
           What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
           it?

                          NATASHA
           Well, he wants you to find it. It's
           been taken. It emits a gamma signature
           that's too weak for us to trace.
           There's no one that knows gamma
           radiation like you do. If there was,
           that's where I'd be.

                          BANNER
           So Fury isn't after the monster?

                          NATASHA
           Not that he's told me.

                          BANNER
           And he tells you everything?

                          NATASHA
           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

                          BANNER
           He needs me in a cage?

                          NATASHA
           No one's gonna put you in a...

                          BANNER

           STOP LYING TO ME!
          The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
          atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

                          BANNER
           I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
           to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
           this the easy way, where you don't use
           that, and the other guy doesn't make a
           mess? Okay? Natasha...
          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
          and speaks into her earpiece.

                          NATASHA
           Stand down. We're good here.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack
          outside.

          INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her.

                          BANNER
           Just you and me?
          Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ NIGHT

          Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with
          members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           This is out of line, Director. You're
           dealing with forces you can't control.

                          NICK FURY
           You ever been in a war, Councilman? In
           a firefight? Did you feel an
           overabundance of control?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           You saying that this Asgard has
           declared war on our planet?

                          NICK FURY
           Not Asgard. Loki.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           He can't be working alone. What about
           the other one? His brother.

                          NICK FURY
           Our intelligence says, Thor is not a
           hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't
           depend on him to help. It's up to us.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Which is why you should be focusing on
           phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

                          NICK FURY
           PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We
           need a response team.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

                          NICK FURY
           This isn't about The Avengers.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           We're running the world's greatest
           covert security network and you're
           gonna leave the fate of human race to a
           handful of freaks.

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We
           need a response team. These people
           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
           believe with the right push they can be
           exactly what we need.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           You believe?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

                          NICK FURY
           No, it's won by soldiers.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory
          he's trying to fight off and repress.

          EXT. HYDRA BASE ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,
          gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.

           STEVE (V.O.)
           There's not enough time! I gotta put
           her in the water!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets
          harder...

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time
          is here for him to crash the plane.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.

           PEGGY (V.O.)
           You won't be alone.

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last
          memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...

           SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)
           Oh my god!

          INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals
          are up. And it seems...

                          SHIELD SCIENTIST
           This guy is still alive!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out
          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
          over repressed feeling.
          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

                          NICK FURY
           Trouble sleeping?

                          STEVE
           I slept for seventy years, sir. I think
           I've had my fill.

                          NICK FURY
           Then you should be out, celebrating,
           seeing the world.
          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
          tape off his hands. He sits down.

                          STEVE
           I went under, the world was at war, I
           wake up, they say we won. They didn't
           say what we lost.

                          NICK FURY
           We've made some mistakes along the way.
           Some very recently.

                          STEVE
           You here with a mission, sir?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

                          STEVE
           Trying to get me back in the world?

                          NICK FURY
           Trying to save it.
          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
          on HYDRA'S projects.

                          STEVE
           Hydra's secret weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           Howard Stark fished that out of the
           ocean when he was looking for you. He
           thought what we think, the Tesseract
           could be the key to unlimited
           sustainable energy. That's something
           the world sorely needs.

                          STEVE
           Who took it from you?

                          NICK FURY
           He's called Loki. He's not from around
           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
           you up to speed on if you're in. The
           world has gotten even stranger than you
           already know.

                          STEVE
           At this point, I doubt anything would
           surprise me.

                          NICK FURY
           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
           debriefing package waiting for you back
           at your apartment.
          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
          the gym.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything you can tell us about
           the Tesseract that we ought to know
           now?

                          STEVE
           You should have left it in the ocean.

          INT. OCEAN ­ NIGHT

          Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is
          cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his
          hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON
          MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

                          TONY
           You're good on this end. The rest is up
           to you.

                          PEPPER POTTS
           (on the other line)
           You disconnected the transition lines?
           Are we off the grid?

          INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

                          TONY
           Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
           of self-sustaining clean energy.

                          PEPPER
           Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over
           and it actually works?

                          TONY
           I assume. Light her up.
          As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is
          switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

                          PEPPER
           How does it look?

                          TONY
           Like Christmas, but with more... me.

                          PEPPER
           Gotta go wider on the public awareness
           campaign. You need to do some press. I
           can do some more tomorrow. I'm working
           on the zoning for the next billboards.

                          TONY
           Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
           Enjoy the moment.

                          PEPPER
           Then get in here and I will.
          TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process
          of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of
          gadgets.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the
           line.

                          TONY
           I'm not in. I'm actually out.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

                          TONY
           Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

          INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE ­ NIGHT

          PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

                          PEPPER
           Levels are holding steady... I think.

                          TONY
           Of course they are, I was directly
           involved. Which brings me to my next
           question: how does it feel to be a
           genius?

                          PEPPER
           Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,
           would I?

                          TONY
           What do you mean? All this came from
           you.

                          PEPPER
           No. All this came from that.
          Points to the energy in his chest plate.

                          TONY
           Give yourself some credit, please.
           Stark Tower is your baby. Give
           yourself... twelve percent of the
           credit.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent?

                          TONY
           An argument can be made for fifteen.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent? For my baby?

                          TONY
           Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
           Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
           And sorry, but the security snafu? That
           was on you.

                          PEPPER
           Oooooh.

                          TONY
           My private elevator...

                          PEPPER
           You mean OUR elevator?

                          TONY
           ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm
           going to pay for that comment about
           percentages in some subtle way later,
           aren't I?
          Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

                          PEPPER
           Not gonna be that subtle.

                          TONY
           I'll tell you what. Next building's
           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

                          PEPPER
           On the lease.

                          TONY
           ...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

                          JARVIS
           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
           protocols are being overwritten.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

                          TONY
           You have reached the life model decoy
           of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This is urgent.

                          TONY
           Then leave it urgently.
          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

                          TONY
           Security breach.

                          (TO PEPPER)
           That's on you.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Mr. Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Phil! Come in.

                          TONY
           Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

                          PEPPER
           Come on in, we're celebrating.

                          TONY
           Which is why he can't stay.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to look this over.
           (he holds out a file towards

                          STARK)
           Soon as possible.

                          TONY
           I don't like being handed things.

                          PEPPER
           That's alright, `cause I love to be
           handed things. So, let's trade.
          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
          passes the file over to Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Thank you.

                          TONY
           Official consulting hours are between
           eight and five every other Thursday.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't a consultation.

                          PEPPER
           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
           know nothing about.

                          TONY
           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

                          PEPPER
           I didn't know that either.

                          TONY
           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
           obsessed, don't play well with others.

                          PEPPER
           That I did know.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't about personality profiles
           anymore.

                          TONY
           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
          databases.

                          TONY
           You know, I thought we were having a
           moment.

                          PEPPER
           I was having twelve percent of a
           moment. This seems serious, Phil's
           pretty shaken.

                          TONY
           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

                          PEPPER
           What is all of this?

                          TONY
           This is, uh...
          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
          Pepper.

                          TONY
           This.
          Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE
          DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which
          Stark and Pepper look on in awe.

                          PEPPER
           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
           tonight.

                          TONY
           Tomorrow.

                          PEPPER
           You've got homework. You've got a lot
           of homework.

                          TONY
           Well, what if I didn't?

                          PEPPER
           If you didn't?

                          TONY
           Yeah.

                          PEPPER
           You mean if you finished?
           (Stark nods his head)
           Well, um...then...
          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
          away in embarrassment.

                          TONY
           Square deal. It's the last date.
          Pepper kisses him.

                          PEPPER
           Work hard.
          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
          holograph form, worried.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
          University.

                          PILOT
           We're about forty minutes out from
           base, sir.
          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

                          STEVE
           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
           replicate the serum that was used on
           me?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           A lot of people were. You were the
           world's first superhero. Banner thought
           gamma radiation might hold the key to
           unlocking Erskine's original formula.
          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

                          STEVE
           Didn't really go his way, did it?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Not so much. When he's not that thing
           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
          Steve looks confused.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
           it's an honor to meet you, officially.
          Steve smiles at Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
           you while you were sleeping.
          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
          the side with Coulson following.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, I was... I was present while
           you were unconscious from the ice. You
           know, it's really, it's just a... just
           a huge honor to have you on board.

                          STEVE
           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
           made some modifications to the uniform.
           I had a little design input.

                          STEVE
           The uniform? Aren't the stars and
           stripes a little... old fashioned?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           With everything that's happening, the
           things that are about to come to light,
           people might just need a little old
           fashioned.
          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB ­ DAY

          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,
          watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

          EXT. THRONE ROOM ­ NIGHT

          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
          appears from the steps.

                          THE OTHER
           The Chitauri grow restless.

                          LOKI
           Let them go at themselves. I will lead
           them into glorious battle.

                          THE OTHER
           Battle? Against the meager might of
           Earth?

                          LOKI
           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is
           as formidable as you claim.

                          THE OTHER
           You question us? You question HIM? He,
           who put the scepter in your hand, who
           gave you ancient knowledge and new
           purpose when you were cast out,
           defeated?

                          LOKI
           I was a king! The rightful king of
           Asgard! Betrayed!

                          THE OTHER
           Your ambition is little, born of
           childish need. We look beyond the Earth
           to greater worlds the Tesseract will
           unveil.

                          LOKI
           You don't have the Tesseract yet.
          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
          scepter.

                          LOKI
           I don't threaten, but until I open the
           doors, until your force is mine to
           command, you are but words.

                          THE OTHER
           You will have your war, Asgardian. If
           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
           us, there will be no realm, no barren
           moon, no crevice where he can't find
           you. You think you know pain? He will
           make you long for something as sweet as
           pain.
          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP ­ DAY

          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
          Natasha.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

                          STEVE
           Ma'am?

                          NATASHA
           Hi.

                          (TO COULSON)
           They need you on the bridge. Face time.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           See you there.
          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
          towards the railing of the ship.

                          NATASHA
           There was quite the buzz around here,
           finding you in the ice. I thought
           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
           to sign his Captain America trading
           cards yet?

                          STEVE
           Trading cards?

                          NATASHA
           They're vintage, he's very proud.
          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
          hisway.

                          STEVE
           Dr. Banner.
          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

                          BANNER
           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
           coming.

                          STEVE
           Word is you can find the cube.

                          BANNER
           Is that the only word on me?

                          STEVE
           Only word I care about.

                          BANNER
           (takes in the sentiment)
           Must be strange for you, all of this.

                          STEVE
           Well, this is actually kind of
           familiar.

                          NATASHA
           Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in
           a minute. It's gonna get a little hard
           to breath.
          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
          "sail."

                          STEVE
           Is this is a submarine?

                          BANNER
           Really? They wanted me in a submerged
           pressurized metal container?
          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN
          VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

                          BANNER

           OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP ­ a flurry of
          activity ­ dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
          who is at the command chair.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We're at lock, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Good. Let's vanish.

          EXT. SKY

          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the
          entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then
          camouflages in the sky.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,
          taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

                          NICK FURY
           Gentlemen.
          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

                          NICK FURY
           Doctor, thank you for coming.

                          BANNER
           Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how
           long am I staying?

                          NICK FURY
           Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
           you're in the clear.

                          BANNER
           Where are you with that?
          Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha
          Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We're sweeping every wirelessly
           accessible camera on the planet.
           Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected
           to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for
           us.

                          NATASHA
           That's still not gonna find them in
           time.

                          BANNER
           You have to narrow the field. How many
           spectrometers do you have access to?

                          NICK FURY
           How many are there?

                          BANNER
           Call every lab you know, tell them to
           put the spectrometers on the roof and
           calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll
           rough out a tracking algorithm based on
           cluster recognition. At least we could
           rule out a few places. Do you have
           somewhere for me to work?

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you show
           Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
          Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.

                          NATASHA
           You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all
           the toys.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB, VACUUM ROOM ­ DAY

          Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.
          Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.

                          SELVIG
           Put it over there!

                          (TO BARTON)
           Where did you find all these people?

                          CLINT BARTON
           SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
           Doctor.
          He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Is this the stuff you need?

                          SELVIG
           Yeah, iridium. It's found in
           meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's
           very hard to get hold of.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

                          SELVIG
           Well, I didn't know!
           (sees Loki coming)
           Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so
           much. It's more than just knowledge,
           it's... truth.

                          LOKI
           I know. What did it show you, Agent
           Barton?

                          CLINT BARTON
           My next target.

                          LOKI
           Tell me what you need.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I'll need a distraction.
           (grabs his bow)
           And an eyeball.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ NIGHT

          As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial
          recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

                          STEVE
           No, no. It's fine.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's a vintage set. It took me a couple
           of years to collect them all. Near
           mint, slight foxing around the edges,
           but...

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent
           match. Weight, cross match, seventy-
           nine percent.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Location?

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.
           He's not exactly hiding.

                          NICK FURY
           Captain, you're up.
          Steve nods. Leaves.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century
          attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to
          the entrance of the gala.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is
          interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

          INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER ­ NIGHT

          Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the
          steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN
          AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in
          silence.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One
          of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

          THWACK!
          He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He
          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
          scanner instrument.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the
          HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS
          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the
          head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on
          screen.
          The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a
          cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

          EXT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes
          in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no
          hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

                          LOKI
           Kneel before me.
          The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.
          Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their
          spears, encircling the crowd.

                          LOKI
           I said. KNEEL!!!
          Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing
          his arms out, smiling.

                          LOKI
           Is not this simpler? Is this not your
           natural state? It's the unspoken truth
           of humanity, that you crave
           subjugation. The bright lure of freedom
           diminishes your life's joy in a mad
           scramble for power, for identity. You
           were made to be ruled. In the end, you
           will always kneel.
          As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN
          refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           Not to men like you.

                          LOKI
           There are no men like me.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           There are always men like you.

                          LOKI
           Look to your elder, people. Let him be
           an example.
          Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS
          blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN
          AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast
          with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You know, the last time I was in
           Germany and saw a man standing above
           everybody else, we ended up
           disagreeing.

                          LOKI

                          (STANDING UP)
           The soldier. A man out of time.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm not the one who's out of time.
          From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed
          towards Loki.

                          NATASHA
           Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
          Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the
          QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time
          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's
          tip on his helmet.

                          LOKI
           Kneel.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Not today!
          Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and
          FLIPS him over.

          INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT


                          NATASHA
           The guy's all over the place.
          Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S
          speakers.

                          IRON MAN
           Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
          Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his
          IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN
          touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry
          the suit has.

                          IRON MAN
           Make your move, Reindeer Games.
          Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes
          away.

                          IRON MAN
           Good move.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Mr. Stark.

                          IRON MAN

           Said anything?

                          NATASHA
           Not a word.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Just get him here. We're low on time.
          With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch
          from a distance, whispering.

                          STEVE
           I don't like it.

                          TONY
           What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

                          STEVE
           I don't remember it being ever that
           easy. This guy packs a wallop.

                          TONY
           Still, you are pretty spry, for an
           older fellow. What's your thing?
           Pilates?

                          STEVE
           What?

                          TONY
           It's like calisthenics. You might have
           missed a couple things, you know, doing
           time as a Capsicle.
          Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.

                          STEVE
           Fury didn't tell me he was calling you
           in.

                          TONY
           Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury
           doesn't tell you.
          THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake
          violently.

                          NATASHA
           Where's this coming from?
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.

                          STEVE
           What's the matter? Scared of a little
           lightning?

                          LOKI
           I'm not overly fond of what follows.
          What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.
          Not a light. A King.
          THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the
          throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony
          puts the IRON MAN helmet on.

                          IRON MAN
           Now there's that guy.

                          NATASHA
           Another Asgardian?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Think the guy's a friendly?

                          IRON MAN
           Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or
           kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
          Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after
          Thor.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, we need a plan of attack!

                          IRON MAN
           I have a plan. Attack.
          IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a
          parachute to follow.

                          NATASHA
           I'd sit this one out, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I don't see how I can.

                          NATASHA
           These guys come from legends, they're
           basically gods.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm
           pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
          Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE ­ NIGHT

          Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into
          the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR.
          He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is
          angry to see him alive in this fashion.

                          THOR
           Where is the Tesseract?

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           I missed you too.

                          THOR
           Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

                          LOKI
           Oh, you should thank me. With the
           Bifrost gone how much dark energy did
           the Allfather have to muster to conjure
           you here? Your precious Earth.
          Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
          Loki. His brother.
          Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is
          everything to a man or god.

                          THOR
           I thought you dead.

                          LOKI
           Did you mourn?

                          THOR
           We all did. Our father...

                          LOKI
           Your father. He did tell you my true
           parentage, did he not?
          Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even
          bigger wedge between them.

                          THOR
           We were raised together, we played
           together, we fought together. Do you
           remember none of that?

                          LOKI

                          (TURNS AROUND)
           I remember a shadow. Living in the
           shade of your greatness. I remember you
           tossing me into an abyss. I was and
           should be king!

                          THOR
           So you take the world I love as
           recompense for your imagined slights.
           No, the Earth is under my protection,
           Loki.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           And you're doing a marvelous job with
           that. The humans slaughter each other
           in droves, while you idly threat. I
           mean to rule them. And why should I
           not?

                          THOR
           You think yourself above them.

                          LOKI
           Well, yes.

                          THOR
           Then you miss the truth of ruling,
           brother. Throne would suit you ill.
          Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up
          to the ledge. Turns around.

                          LOKI
           I've seen worlds you've never known
           about! I have grown, Odinson, in my
           exile! I have seen the true power of
           the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

                          THOR
           Who showed you this power? Who controls
           the would-be-king?

                          LOKI
           I am a king!

                          THOR
           Not here! You give up the Tesseract!
           You give up this poisonous dream! You
           come home.

                          LOKI
           I don't have it. You need the cube to
           bring me home, but I've sent it off I
           know not where.
          Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.

                          THOR
           You listen well, brother. I...

          THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN

          MID-FLIGHT.

                          LOKI
           I'm listening.

          EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.
          IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet
          opens up.

                          THOR
           Do not touch me again!

                          TONY
           Then don't take my stuff.

                          THOR
           You have no idea what you're dealing
           with.

                          TONY
           Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother
           know you weareth her drapes?

                          THOR
           This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
           will face Asgardian justice!

                          TONY
           He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
           Until then, stay out of my way...
           tourist.
          The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick
          move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear
          across into a tree.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Okay.
          From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
          his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
          hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!
          Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises
          it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points
          the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting
          increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Power at 400% capacity.

                          TONY
           How about that?
          IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his
          knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON
          MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.

          EXT. SKY ­ NIGHT

          The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING
          him into the side of a mountain.
          THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.

          EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every
          tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both
          HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
          his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
          IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
          ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
          him and SMASH him down hard.
          Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
          but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
          facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
          CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
          stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on
          top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Hey! That's enough!
           (comes down; looks at Thor)
           Now, I don't know what you plan on
           doing here.

                          THOR
           I've come here to put an end to Loki's
           schemes!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Then prove it! Put the hammer down.

                          IRON MAN
           Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his
           hammer!

          THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJÖLNIR.
          Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,
          raises the hammer.

                          THOR

                          (TO CAP)
           You want me to put the hammer down?

          THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR
          brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION
          OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE

          SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.
          IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right
          next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks
          at both men.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are we done here?

          THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.

          INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY ­ NIGHT

          DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,
          smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working
          on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,
          nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE
          GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control
          panel of the cell.

                          NICK FURY
           In case it's unclear. You try to
           escape. You so much as scratch that
           glass.
          Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's
          cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.
          Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit
          his pants. Not a god, though.

                          NICK FURY
           Thirty thousand feet, straight down in
           a steel trap. You get how that works?!
          Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.

                          NICK FURY
           Ant.
          Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel
          trap.

                          NICK FURY
           Boot.

                          LOKI

                          (SMIRKING)
           It's an impressive cage. Not built, I
           think, for me.

                          NICK FURY
           Built for something a lot stronger than
           you.

                          LOKI
           Oh, I've heard.
          Loki looks into the camera.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS

          The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.
          Banner looks at the monitor, intently.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ CONTINUOUS


                          LOKI
           The mindless beast, makes play he's
           still a man. How desperate are you,
           that you call upon such lost creatures
           to defend you?

                          NICK FURY
           How desperate am I? You threaten my
           world with war. You steal a force you
           can't hope to control.

                          (MORE)

           NICK FURY (CONT'D)
           You talk about peace and you kill
           `cause it's fun. You have made me very
           desperate. You might not be glad that
           you did.

                          LOKI
           Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To
           have the Tesseract, to have power,
           unlimited power. And for what? A warm
           light for all mankind to share, and
           then to be reminded what real power is.

                          NICK FURY

                          (SMILING)
           Well, you let me know if Real Power
           wants a magazine or something.
          Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back
          at the camera, smirking.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't
          even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all
          just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --

                          BANNER
           He really grows on you, doesn't he?

                          STEVE
           Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,
           what's his play?

                          THOR

                          (COMING TOO)
           He has an army called the Chitauri.
           They're not of Asgard or any world
           known. He means to lead them against
           your people. They will win him the
           earth. In return, I suspect, for the
           Tesseract.

                          STEVE

                          (SERIOUSLY)
           An army? From outer space?

                          BANNER
          So he's building another portal. That's
          what he needs Erik Selvig for.

                          THOR
          Selvig?

                          BANNER
          He's an astrophysicist.

                          THOR
          He's a friend.

                          NATASHA
          Loki has him under some kind of spell,
          along with one of ours.

                          STEVE
          I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
          He's not leading an army from here.

                          BANNER
          I don't think we should be focusing on
          Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of
          cats, you could smell crazy on him.

                          THOR
          Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond
          reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's
          my brother.

                          NATASHA
          He killed eighty people in two days.

                          THOR
          He's adopted.

                          BANNER
          Iridium, what did they need the Iridium
          for?

                          TONY
          It's a stabilizing agent.
           (walks in with Coulson; to

                          COULSON)
          I'll fly you there. Keep the love
          alive. Means the portal won't collapse
          on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

                          TONY (CONT'D)

                          (TO THOR)
           No hard feelings, Point Break. You've
           got a mean swing.
           (referring to the Iridium)
           Also, it means the portal can open as
           wide, and stay open as long, as Loki
           wants.

                          (TO CREW)
           Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top
           sails. That man is playing GALAGA!
           Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.
           (covering his eye, looks

                          AROUND)
           How does Fury do this?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           He turns.
          Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING
          IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.

                          TONY
           Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest
           of the raw materials, Agent Barton can
           get his hands on pretty easily. Only
           major component he still needs is a
           power source. A high energy density,
           something to kick start the cube.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           When did you become an expert in
           thermonuclear astrophysics?

                          TONY
           Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,
           the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the
           only one who did the reading?

                          STEVE
           Does Loki need any particular kind of
           power source?

                          BANNER
           He's got to heat the cube to a
           hundredand twenty million Kelvin just
           to break through the Coulomb barrier.

                          TONY
           Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
           stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.

                          BANNER
           Well, if he could do that he could
           achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor
           on the planet.

                          TONY
           Finally, someone who speaks English.

                          STEVE
           Is that what just happened?
          Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as
          the mutual respect for each other shows.

                          TONY
           It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
           You're work on anti-electron collisions
           is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of
           the way you lose control and turn into
           an enormous green rage monster.

                          BANNER

                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Thanks.

                          NICK FURY

                          (WALKING IN)
           Dr. Banner is only here to track the
           cube. I was hoping you might join him.

                          STEVE
           Let's start with that stick of his. It
           may be magical, but it works an awful
           lot like a HYDRA weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           I don't know about that, but it is
           powered by the cube. And I'd like to
           know how Loki used it to turn two of
           the sharpest men I know into his
           personal flying monkeys.

                          THOR
           Monkeys? I do not understand.

                          STEVE
           I do! I understood that reference.
          Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.

                          TONY
           Shall we play, doctor?

                          BANNER
           Let's play some.
          As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so
          discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
          playing.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)

          Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
          the scepter for radiation.
          Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many
          algorithms and equations.

                          BANNER
           The gamma readings are definitely
           consistent with Selvig's reports on the
           Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
           process.

                          TONY
           If we bypass their mainframe and direct
           a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
           clock this around six hundred
           teraflops.

                          BANNER
           All I packed was a tooth brush.

                          TONY

                          (SMILES)
           You know, you should come by STARK
           TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all
           R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.

                          BANNER
           Thanks, but the last time I was in New
           York I kind of broke...Harlem.

                          TONY
           Well, I promise a stress free
           environment. No tension. No surprises.
          Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.
          Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.

                          BANNER

           OW!
          Tony looks at Banner closely.

                          TONY
           Nothing?

                          STEVE

                          (TO BANNER)
           Hey! Are you nuts?

                          TONY
           You really have got a lid on it,
           haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow
           jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

                          STEVE
           Is everything a joke to you?

                          TONY
           Funny things are.

                          STEVE
           Threatening the safety of everyone on
           this ship isn't funny. No offense,
           doctor.

                          BANNER
           No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come
           aboard if I couldn't handle pointy
           things.

                          TONY
           You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to
           strut.

                          STEVE
           And you need to focus on the problem,
           Mr. Stark.

                          TONY
           You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us
           and why now? Why not before? What isn't
           he telling us? I can't do the equation
           unless I have all the variables.

                          STEVE
           You think Fury's hiding something?

                          TONY
           He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His
           secrets have secrets.
           (points to Banner)
           It's bugging him too, isn't it?

                          BANNER
           (bobbling the words)
           Uh...I just wanna finish my work here
           and...

                          STEVE
           Doctor?
          A beat.

                          BANNER
           'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's
           jab at Fury about the cube.

                          STEVE
           I heard it.

                          BANNER
           (pointing at Tony)
           Well, I think that was meant for you.
           Even if Barton didn't post that all
           over the news.

                          STEVE
           The Stark Tower? That big ugly
           (Tony gives him a look)
           ...building in New York?

                          BANNER
          It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-
          sustaining energy source. That building
          will run itself for what, a year?

                          TONY
          That's just the prototype. I'm kind of
          the only name in clean energy right
          now.

                          BANNER
           (referring to Tony)
          So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on
          the Tesseract project? I mean, what are
          they doing in the energy business in
          the first place?

                          TONY
          I should probably look into that once
          my decryption programmer finishes
          breaking into all of SHIELD's secure
          files.

                          STEVE
           (taken by that)
          I'm sorry, did you say...?

                          TONY
          Jarvis has been running it since I hit
          the bridge. In a few hours we'll know
          every dirty secret SHIELD has ever
          tried to hide.
           (holds out a bag of blueberries)
          Blueberry?

                          STEVE
          Yet you're confused about why they
          didn't want you around?

                          TONY
          An intelligence organization that fears
          intelligence? Historically, not
          possible.

                          STEVE
           I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
           This is a man who means to start a war,
           and if don't stay focused, he'll
           succeed. We have orders, we should
           follow them.

                          TONY
           Following is not really my style.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           And you're all about style, aren't you?

                          TONY
           (a nerve hit)
           Of the people in this room, which one
           is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.
           not of use?

                          BANNER
           Steve, tell me none of this smells a
           little funky to you?
          Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,
          shakes it off.

                          STEVE
           Just find the cube.
          Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,
          he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.

          BACK IN THE LAB

                          TONY
           That's the guy my dad never shut up
           about? Wondering if they shouldn't have
           kept him on ice.

                          BANNER
           The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does
           have the jump on us.

                          TONY
           What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm
           gonna be there when it does.

                          BANNER
           And I'll read all about it.

                          TONY
           Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like
           the rest of us.

                          BANNER
           Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
           I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a
           nightmare.

                          TONY
           You know, I've got a cluster of
           shrapnel, trying every second to crawl
           its way into my heart.
           (points at the MINI-ARC
           REACTOR in his chest)
           This stops it. This little circle of
           light. It's part of me now, not just
           armor. It's a... terrible privilege.

                          BANNER
           But you can control it.

                          TONY
           Because I learned how.

                          BANNER
           It's different.
          Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the
          data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

                          TONY
           Hey, I've read all about your accident.
           That much gamma exposure should have
           killed you.

                          BANNER
           So you're saying that the Hulk... the
           other guy... saved my life?

                          (MORE)

                          BANNER (CONT'D)
           That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.
           Saved it for what?

                          TONY

                          (A BEAT)
           I guess we'll find out.
          Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.

                          BANNER
           You might not like that.

                          TONY
           You just might.

          INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C ­ NIGHT

          Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and
          STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,
          filled with METAL CRATES stacked.
          Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds
          onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.

          INT. VAN ­ NIGHT

          Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are
          driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig
          carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal
          prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS
          ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ NIGHT

          On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor
          looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           As soon as Loki took the doctor we
           moved Jane Foster. We've got an
           excellent observatory in Traunsee. She
           was asked to consult there very
           suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,
           private plane, very remote. She'll be
           safe.

                          THOR
           Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking
           Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for
           him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He talks about you a lot. You changed
           his life. You changed everything around
           here.

                          THOR
           They were better as they were. We
           pretend on Asgard that we're more
           advanced, but we...we come here
           battling like BILCHSTEIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Like what?

                          THOR
           BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big
           antlers. You don't have those?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Don't think so.

                          THOR
           They are repulsive, and they trample
           everything in their path.
          Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the
          window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.

                          THOR
           When I first came to earth, Loki's rage
           followed me here and your people paid
           the price. And now again. In my youth I
           courted war.

           NICK FURY (O.S.)
           War hasn't started yet.

                          (WALKING IN)
           You think you can make Loki tell us
           what the Tesseract is?

                          THOR
           I do not know. Loki's mind is far
           afield, it's not just power he craves,
           it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain
           that would prize his need from him.

                          NICK FURY
           A lot of guys think that, until the
           pain stops.

                          THOR
           What are you asking me to do?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm asking. What are you prepared to
           do?

                          THOR
           Loki is a prisoner.

                          NICK FURY
           Then why do I feel like he's the only
           person on this boat that wants to be
           here?
          Thor doesn't answer.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he
          stops.

                          LOKI
           There's not many people that can sneak
           up on me.
           (turns to see NATASHA

                          STANDING THERE)

                          NATASHA
           But you figured I'd come.

                          LOKI
           After. After whatever tortures Fury can
           concoct, you would appear as a friend,
           as a balm. And I would cooperate.

                          NATASHA
          I wanna know what you've done to Agent
          Barton.

                          LOKI
          I'd say I've expanded his mind.

                          NATASHA
          And once you've won. Once you're king
          of the mountain. What happens to his
          mind?

                          LOKI
          Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

                          NATASHA
          Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

                          LOKI

                          (SITTING DOWN)
          Tell me.

                          NATASHA
           (she pulls up a chair as

                          WELL)
          Before I worked for SHIELD, I
          uh...well, I made a name for myself. I
          have a very specific skillset. I didn't
          care who I used it for, or on. I got on
          SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent
          Barton was sent to kill me, he made a
          different call.

                          LOKI
          And what will you do if I vow to spare
          him?

                          NATASHA
          Not let you out.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
          Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in
          the balance, and you bargain for one
          man?

                          NATASHA
           Regimes fall every day. I tend not to
           weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.

                          LOKI
           What is it you want?

                          NATASHA
           It's really not that complicated. I've
           got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe
           it out.

                          LOKI
           Can you? Can you wipe out that much
           red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃO PAULO? THE
           HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me
           everything. Your ledger is dripping,
           it's gushing red, and you think saving
           a man no more virtuous than yourself
           will change anything?

                          (STANDING; ANGRY)
           This is the basest sentimentality. This
           is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!

                         INTERCUTS
          - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You lie and kill in the service of
           liars and killers.
          - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury
          oversees.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You pretend to be separate, to have
           your own code, something that makes up
           for the horrors. But they are a part of
           you, and they will never go away!
          - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and
          looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF

          HYDRA WEAPONS.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.

                          LOKI
           I won't touch Barton. Not until I make
           him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In
           every way he knows you fear! And when
           he'll wake just long enough to see his
           good work, and when he screams, I'll
           split his skull! This is my bargain,
           you mewling quim!
          NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.

                          NATASHA

                          (QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)
           You're a monster.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           No, you brought the monster.

                          NATASHA
           (turns back around; poised)
           So, Banner... that's your play.

                          LOKI

                          (STAGGERED)
           What?

                          NATASHA

                          (ON EARPIECE)
           Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep
           Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send
           Thor as well.

                          (TO LOKI)
           Thank you for your cooperation.
          Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on
          the scepter.

                          NICK FURY

                          (ANGRY)
           What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

                          TONY
           Uh...kind of been wondering the same
           thing about you.

                          NICK FURY
           You're supposed to be locating the
           Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           We are. The model's locked and we're
           sweeping for the signature now. When we
           get a hit, we'll have the location
           within half a mile.

                          TONY
           And you'll get your cube back, no muss,
           no fuss.
           (suddenly his monitor show a
           collection of SECRET FILES)
           What is PHASE 2?
          Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing
          Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.

                          STEVE
           PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make
           weapons.

                          (TO TONY)
           Sorry, the computer was moving a little
           slow.

                          NICK FURY
           (trying to explain)
           Rogers, we gathered everything related
           to the Tesseract. This does not mean
           that we're...

                          TONY
           I'm sorry, Nick.
          Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of

          THE WEAPONS.

                          TONY
           What were you lying?

                          STEVE
           I was wrong, director. The world hasn't
           changed a bit.
          At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha
          keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.

                          BANNER
           Did you know about this?

                          NATASHA
           You wanna think about removing yourself
           from this environment, doctor?

                          BANNER
           I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well
           removed.

                          NATASHA
           Loki's manipulating you.

                          BANNER
           And you've been doing what exactly?

                          NATASHA
           You didn't come here because I bat my
           eyelashes at you.

                          BANNER
           Yes, and I'm not leaving because
           suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd
           like to know why SHIELD is using the
           Tesseract to build weapons of mass
           destruction.

                          NICK FURY
           Because of him.
           (pointing at Thor)

                          THOR

                          (STUNNED)
           Me?

                          NICK FURY
          Last year earth had a visitor from
          another planet who had a grudge match
          that leveled a small town. We learned
          that not only are we not alone, but we
          are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

                          THOR
          My people want nothing but peace with
          your planet.

                          NICK FURY
          But you're not the only people out
          there, are you? And, you're not the
          only threat. The world's filling up
          with people who can't be matched, they
          can't be controlled.

                          STEVE
          Like you controlled the cube?

                          THOR
          You're work with the Tesseract is what
          drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is
          the signal to all the realms that the
          earth is ready for a higher form of
          war.

                          STEVE
          A higher form?

                          NICK FURY
          You forced our hand. We had to come up
          with something.

                          TONY
          Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always
          calms everything right down.

                          NICK FURY
          Remind me again how you made your
          fortune, Stark?

                          STEVE TONY
          I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is
          weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?
          deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR
          everything?
           I thought humans were more
           evolved than this.

                          NICK FURY
           Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet
           and blow stuff up?

                          THOR
           Did you always give your champions such
           mistrust?

                          NATASHA BANNER
          Are you all really that Captain America is on
          naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential
          threats? watch list?

                          TONY STEVE
           (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one
          You're on that list? Are you more crack...
          above or below angry bees?
          Threatening! I feel
          threatened!
          As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's
          scepter is glowing brightly.

          INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER ­ DAY

          Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the
          ship.

           SHIELD BASE VOICE
           661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.
           What is your hull, over?

                          BARTON
           Arms to ammunition, over.
          Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton
          pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off
          each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.

                          THOR
           You speak of control, yet you court
           chaos.

                          BANNER
           It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what
           are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a
           chemical mixture that makes chaos.
           We're... we're a time-bomb.

                          NICK FURY
           You need to step away.

                          TONY
           (puts his arm around Steve)
           Why shouldn't the guy let off a little
           steam?

                          STEVE
           (pushes Tony off)
           You know damn well why! Back off!

                          TONY
           (comes face-to-face with Cap)
           Oh, I'm starting to want you to make
           me.

                          STEVE
           Big man in a suit of armor. Take that
           off, what are you?

                          TONY
           Genius, billionaire, playboy,
           philanthropist.

                          STEVE
           I know guys with none of that worth ten
           of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.

                          (MORE)

                          STEVE (CONT'D)
           The only thing you really fight for is
           yourself. You're not the guy to make
           the sacrifice play, to lay down on a
           wire and let the other guy crawl over
           you.

                          TONY
           I think I would just cut the wire.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           Always a way out... You know, you may
           not be a threat, but you better stop
           pretending to be a hero.

                          TONY
           (that did it)
           A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,
           Rogers. Everything special about you
           came out of a bottle!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one
          of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding
          out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points
          right at the engine.
          Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred
          feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then
          SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the
          engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just
          stands there, unmoving.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
          Thor laughs at them.

                          THOR
           You people are so petty... and tiny.
          Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.

                          BANNER
           Yeah, this is a tee...

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you escort
           Dr.Banner back to his...

                          BANNER
           Where? You rented my room.

                          NICK FURY
           The cell was just in case...

                          BANNER
           In case you needed to kill me, but you
           can't! I know! I tried!

                          (A BEAT)
           I got low. I didn't see an end, so I
           put a bullet in my mouth and the other
           guy spit it out! So I moved on. I
           focused on helping other people. I was
           good, until you dragged me back into
           this freak show and put everyone here
           at risk!
          Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets
          unnerved.

                          BANNER
           You wanna know my secret, Agent
           Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay
           calm?
          BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

                          STEVE
           Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.

          BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S
          SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.

                          TONY
           Got it.
          Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.

                          BANNER
           Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my
           little party trick after all.

                          THOR
           Located the Tesseract?

                          TONY
           I can get there faster.

                          STEVE
           Look, all of us...

                          THOR
           The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no
           human is a match for it.
          Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.

                          STEVE
           You're not going alone!

                          TONY
           You gonna stop me?

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's find out.

                          TONY
           I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit.
          At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices
          something about the Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           Oh, my God!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE

          ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER!

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and
          Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the
          lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit!

                          TONY
           Yep!
          Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching
          his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.

                          NICK FURY

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers
          activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning
          scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the
          bridge as calm as possible.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is
           down! Can we get a run in?

           Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but
           it's impossible to get out there and
           make repairs while we're in the air.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We lose one more engine, we won't be.
           Somebody's got to get inside and patch
           that engine.

          Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ MORNING

          Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having
          landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain
          control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.

                          NATASHA (CONT'D)
           (quietly, to herself)
           I'm okay. We're okay, right?

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY

          Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel
          down into a corridor.

                          BARTON
           Get that engine down! Detention! Get
           him through the dark! Come with me.
          Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.

          EXT. ND HALLWAY, CARRIER ­ MORNING

          Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall.

                          TONY
           Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
          Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's
          IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ CONTINUOUS

          ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress
          the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.
          Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...

                          NATASHA
           Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.
           This is just what Loki wants. We're
           gonna be okay. Listen to me.
          Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She
          furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

                          NATASHA
           We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on
           my life I will get you out of this, you
           will walk away, and never...

                          BANNER
           Your life?
          His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
          morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the
          carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the
          lights go out.

                          NATASHA

                          (PLEADING)
           Bruce.
          Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives
          Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the
          rubble. She stops.
          The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a
          disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK
          chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.
          She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of
          pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.
          Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and
          stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike
          anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

          Loki looks up, smiling mischievously.

          Fury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than
          before. The HELMSMAN is in complete disarray.

                          NICK FURY
           Bring the carrier inwards and head
           south. Take us to the water.

                          HELMSMAN
           Why water? Navigations recalibrated
           after the engine failure.

                          NICK FURY
           Is the sun coming up?!

                          HELMSMAN
           Yes, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Then put it on the left! Get us over
           water! One more turbine goes down and
           we drop.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to
          portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire
          extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do
          anything.
          Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN

          OFF.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, I'm here!

                          TONY
           Good. See what we got.
          Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged
          engine.

          INSIDE THE SUIT
          Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and
          its layouts.

                          TONY
           I gotta get this super conducting
           cooling system back online before I can
           access the rotors and work on
           dislodging the debris.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve.

                          IRON MAN
           I need you to get to that engine
           control panel and tell me which relays
           are in overload position.
          IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a
          man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!

                          IRON MAN
           What's it look like in there?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           It seems to run on some form of
           electricity.

                          IRON MAN
           Well, you're not wrong.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.
          Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.
          Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk
          and spins.
          ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid
          nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE
          SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of
          corridors. The sound the monster is coming.
          Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind
          her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.
          Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,

          SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.
          The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has
          never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS
          KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ CONTINUOUS

          Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the
          hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK
          stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.
          The HULK makes his move.
          SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks
          HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him
          off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and
          wraps around it.

                          THOR
           We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to
           think!
          HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM

          FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine
          engine. It's bad, but still fixable.

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           The relays are intact. What's our next
           move?

                          TONY
           Even if I clear the rotors, this thing
           won't re-engage without a jump. I'm
           gonna have to get in there and push.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Well if that thing gets up to speed,
           you'll get shredded!

                          TONY
           Then stay in the control unit and
           reverse polarity long enough to
           disengage mag...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Speak English!

                          TONY
           See that red lever? It'll slow the
           rotors down long enough for me to get
           out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He
          sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY

          Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his
          head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it
          off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand
          out.
          The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
          toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
          right at him. At the last second, MJÖLNIR flies into his hand
          and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
          HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just
          happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the
          jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

          THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.
          Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
          Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
          heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but
          can't. Mjölnir rests atop his hand.
          Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
          hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
          might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
          Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his
          hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his
          CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

           bay.
          Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE
          appears.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           GRENADE!
          The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a
          shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the
          entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready,
          waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.
          A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop
          one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,
          who looks hot and sexy holding her gun.

          cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He
          jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...

          ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.

                          ESCORT 606 PILOT

           TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!
          HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK
          tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but

          HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!

          THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.
          ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK

          PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS
          on it, relieving the rotors.
          On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as
          they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with
          Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as
          throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word
          for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing
          down at them.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and
          are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

                          NICK FURY
           They are not getting through here, so
           what the hell...
          Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES
          critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards
          Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

          OUTLETS.
          Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-
          activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every
          single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to
          shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT
          to one side.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)
           Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.

                          NICK FURY
           It's Barton. He took out our systems.
           He's headed for the detention level.
           Does anybody copy?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY

          Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking
          back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her
          coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.

                          NATASHA
           This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.
          Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Stark, we're losing altitude.

                          IRON MAN
           Yeah. Noticed.
          The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S
          BOOSTERS get more and more bright.
          On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at
          Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA
          loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto
          a LOOSE CABLE.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,
          escaping.

                          THOR

           NO!
          Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES
          down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki
          dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind
          the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki
          smiles.

                          LOKI
           Are you ever not going to fall for
           that?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,
          Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand
          fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making
          Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJÖLNIR onto the glass cell. To
          his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES
          the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING

          SOLDIER.

                          LOKI
           (smiles; walks over to the

                          CONTROL PANEL)
           The humans think us immortal. Should we
           test that?
          Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON
          stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Move away, please.
          Loki moves away from the switch.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You like this? We started working on
           the prototype after you sent THE
           DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it
           does. Do you wanna find out?

          A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE

          REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.

                          THOR
           Nooo!
          Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps
          down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.
          He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.
          Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND

          DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha
          KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at
          her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.
          Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to
          SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a
          LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his
          wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.
          Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm
          LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes
          down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

                          BARTON
           Natasha...
          Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

          EXT. SKY

          Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell
          pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,
          but misses. Land draws closer.
          In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto
          the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit
          the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out
          into the meadow.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and
          proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're gonna lose.

                          LOKI

                          (TURNING)
           Am I?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's in your nature.

                          LOKI
           Your heroes are scattered, your
           floating fortress falls from the
           sky...where is my disadvantage?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You lack conviction.

                          LOKI
           I don't think I...

          AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,

          CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           So that's what it does.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch
          has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE
          ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS
          itself.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Cap, I need the lever!

           STEVE (V.O.)
           I need a minute here!

                          TONY
           Lever. Now!
          Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is
          then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the
          rotors, getting chewed up.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the
          railing.
          BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself
          up and finally PULLS the lever.
          A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit
          heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.
          BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the
          wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking
          Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

                          NICK FURY
           Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No. I'm clocked out here.

                          NICK FURY
           Not an option.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's okay, boss. This was never going
           to work... if they didn't have
           something... to...
          Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks
          on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY


           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Agent Coulson is down.
          Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on
          her headset, standing up.

           SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)
           Paramedics are on their way.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           They're here.

          INT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          Steve and Tony listen in as well.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           They called it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ LATER

          Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone
          there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown
          on their devastated faces.

                          NICK FURY
           These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
           Guess he never did get you to sign
           them.
          Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table
          towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.

                          NICK FURY
           We're dead in the air up here. Our
           communications, location of the cube,
           Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
           Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that
           coming.

                          (A BEAT)
           Yes, we were going to build an arsenal
           with the Tesseract. I never put all my
           chips on that number though, because I
           was playing something even riskier.
           There was an idea, Stark knows this,
           called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
           idea was to bring together a group of
           remarkable people, see if they could
           become something more. See if they
           could work together when we needed them
           to, to fight the battles that we never
           could. Phil Coulson died still
           believing in that idea, in heroes.
          Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

                          NICK FURY
           Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

          EXT. MEADOW ­ DAY

          Thor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJÖLNIR.

          INT. ABANDONED BUILDING ­ DAY

          Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is
          IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED
          IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,
          amazed.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           You fell out of the sky.

                          BANNER

                          (COMING TO)
           Did I hurt anybody?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           There's nobody around here to get hurt.
           You did scare the hell out of some
           pigeons though.

                          BANNER
           Lucky.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Or just good aim. You were awake when
           you fell.

                          BANNER
           You saw?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           The whole thing, right through the
           ceiling. Big and green and buck ass
           nude. Here...
          He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           I didn't think those would fit you
           until you shrunk down to a regular size
           fella.

                          BANNER
           Thank you.

                          BANNER
           What?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           From outer space, an alien?

                          BANNER
           No.

           take time.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I don't understand. Have you ever had
           someone take your brain and play? Pull
           you out and send something else in? Do
           you know what it's like to be unmade?

                          NATASHA
          You know that I do.

                          NATASHA
          Don't. Don't do that to yourself,
          Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters
          and magic and nothing we were ever
          trained for.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Loki, he got away?

                          NATASHA
          Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

                          CLINT BARTON
          I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
          He's gonna make his play soon though.
          Today.

                          NATASHA
          We gotta stop him.

          Yeah? Who's we?

                          NATASHA

          Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's

           But you don't. You're a spy, not a
           soldier. Now you want to wade into a

                          STEVE
           Was he married?

                          TONY
           No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.

                          STEVE
           I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

                          TONY
           He was an idiot.

                          STEVE
           Why? For believing?

                          TONY
           For taking on Loki alone.

                          STEVE
           He was doing his job.

                          TONY
           He was out of his league. He should
           have waited. He should have...

                          STEVE
          Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

                          TONY

                          (WALKS AWAY)
          Right. How did that work for him?

                          STEVE
          Is this the first time you've lost a
          soldier?

                          TONY
           (turns around sharply)
          WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching
          to Fury's fife!

                          STEVE
          Neither am I! He's got the same blood
          on his hands as Loki does. Right now
          we've got to put that aside and get
          this done. Now Loki needs a power
          source, if we can put together a
          list...

                          TONY
           (looking at the blood stained

                          WALL)
          He made it personal.

                          STEVE
          That's not the point.

                          TONY
          That is the point. That's Loki's point.
          He hit us all right where we live. Why?

                          STEVE
          To tear us apart.

                          TONY
          He had to conquer his greed, but he
          knows he has to take us out to win,
          right? That's what he wants. He wants
          to beat us and he wants to be seen
          doing it. He wants an audience.

                          STEVE
           Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.

                          TONY
           Yeah. That's just a preview, this is
           opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.
           He wants flowers, he wants parades, he
           wants a monument built in the skies
           with his name plastered...

                          (PAUSE)
           Sonofabitch!

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig works around the CMS device that has already been set-
          upon the rooftop of Tony's tower.

          INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM ­ DAY

          Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.

                          STEVE
           Time to go.

                          NATASHA
           Go where?

                          STEVE
           I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly
           one of those jets?
          Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I can.
          Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's
          on their side.

                          STEVE
           You got a suit?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah.

                          STEVE
           Then suit up.

                         MONTAGE
          - KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from
          above, colliding on MJÖLNIR. The explosion is massive. THE

          MIGHTY THOR.
          - CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls on his HELMET and SHIELD.
          - Tony WELDS his IRON MAN helmet. LIGHT slips down over IRON
          MAN's eye holes.
          - BLACK WIDOW attaches a GLOVE GAUNTLET with her rounds on her
          wrist. A BLUE LIGHT CHARGES.
          - HAWKEYE slips on his QUIVER of arrows.

          EXT/INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          Cap, Widow and Hawkeye walk towards and into the QUINJET. A
          YOUNG SHIELD PILOT looks and stands in their way.

           YOUNG SHIELD PILOT
           You are not authorized to be here...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Son... just don't.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating. Agent Hill
          walks up to him, knowing.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Hill?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Those cards, they were in Coulson's
           locker, not in his jacket.

                          NICK FURY
           They needed the push.
           (holding Coulson's cards)
          A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying
          off as well as the QUINJET.

                          NICK FURY
           They found it. Get our communications
           back up, whatever you have to do. I
           want eyes on everything.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS
          device, holding the Tesseract.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The
           device is already self-sustained.

                          TONY
           Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

                          SELVIG
           It's too late! It can't stop now. He
           wants to show us something! A new
           universe.

                          IRON MAN
           Okay.
          IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy
          from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls
          backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK
          TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

                          JARVIS
           The barrier is pure energy. It's
           unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready
           to be deployed.

                          TONY
           Skip the spinning rims. We're on the
           clock.
          TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits
          him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into
          the penthouse.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

          Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the
          steps, towards the bar.

                          LOKI
           Please tell me you're going to appeal
           to my humanity.

                          TONY
           Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten
           you.

                          LOKI
           You should have left your armor on for
           that.

                          TONY
           Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
           You've got the blue stick of destiny.
           Would you like a drink?

                          LOKI
           Stalling me won't change anything.

                          TONY
           No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You
           sure? I'm having one.

                          LOKI
           The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will
           change that. What have I to fear?

                          TONY

           THE AVENGERS.
           (Loki looks at him, confused)
           It's what we call ourselves, sort of
           like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'
           type of thing.

                          LOKI
           Yes, I've met them.

                          TONY

                          (SMILING)
           Yeah, takes us a while to get any
           traction, I'll give you that one.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           But, let's do a head count here. Your
           brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,
           a living legend who kind of lives up to
           the legend; a man with breath-taking
           anger management issues; a couple of
           master assassins, and you, big fella,
           you've managed to piss off every single
           one of them.

                          LOKI
           That was the plan.

                          TONY
           Not a great plan. When they come, and
           they will, they'll come for you.
          From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
          BRACELETS, a honing device.

                          LOKI
           I have an army.

                          TONY
           We have a HULK.

                          LOKI
           I thought the beast had wandered off.

                          TONY
           You're missing the point. There's no
           throne, there is no version of this,
           where you come out on top. Maybe your
           army comes and maybe it's too much for
           us, but it's all on you. Because if we
           can't protect the Earth, you can be
           damned well sure we'll avenge it.

                          LOKI
           (slowly walks up to him;
           raising the scepter)
           How will your friends have time for
           me,when they're so busy fighting you?
          Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.
          Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

                          LOKI
           It should work.

                          TONY
           Well, performance issues. You know?
          In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
          the room.

                          TONY
           Jarvis. Anytime now.
          Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

                          LOKI
           You will all fall before me.
          LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.
          From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.
          The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
          begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
          It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits
          the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

                          IRON MAN
           And there's one other person you pissed
           off! His name was Phil.
          Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on
          his ass.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into
          the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

          ANOTHER PORTAL.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS
          out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on
          the end.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Right. Army.
          IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a
          miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the
          JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no
          missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN
          flies towards the city.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at
          the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes
          BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

          AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

          BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

          EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings
          out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.
          Loki turns to his ENEMY.

                          THOR
           Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll
           destroy it!

                          LOKI
           You can't. There is no stopping it.
           There is only the war!

                          THOR
           So be it.
          Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons
          collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage
          and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.
          They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI
          towards his tower.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Stark, we're heading north east.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          IRON MAN
           What, did you stop for drive-thru?
           Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out
           for you.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going
          at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to
          crash.
          Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the
          QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the

          CHITAURI.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we have more incoming.

                          TONY
           Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
          IRON MAN heads back to the portal.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the
          scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           See them.
          HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at
          Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF
          ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
          THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
          of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
          PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their
          seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed
          by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons
          in hand.

          EXT. FOUR WAY STREET ­ DAY

          The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,
          the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.
          With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!
          Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES
          OVER the TRIO.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the
          buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and
          begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, are you seeing this?

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           I'm seeing, still working on believing.
           Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          TONY
           Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a
           soft spot.
          IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch
          the city falling to ash.

                          THOR
           Look at this! Look around you! You
           think this madness will end with your
           rule?

                          LOKI
           (tries to look away)
           It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

                          THOR
           No. We can. Together.
          Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki
          stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

                          LOKI
           Sentiment.
          Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then
          SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor
          looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of
          CHITAURI follow his lead.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki
          taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

          CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

          IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.
          TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their
          shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the
          bridge.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Those people need assistance down
           there.
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at
          them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           We got this. It's good. Go!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (AT HAWKEYE)
           You think you can hold them off?

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain.
           (pulls a trigger on his bow;
           a narrow is mechanically

                          CHOSEN)
           It would be my genuine pleasure.
          HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few
          seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,
          followed by an EXPLOSION.
          Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING
          cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.
          HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL
          CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out
          to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.
          People begin to run out.
          BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the
          ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

                          HAWKEYE
           You and I remember Budapest
           verydifferently.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty
          pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

                          YOUNG COP
           We need to get out! They gotta bring
           the National Guard!

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           National Guard? Does the army know
           what's happening here?

                          YOUNG COP
           Do we?
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this
          ridiculous looking man.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I need men in these buildings. There
           are people inside that can run into the
           line of fire. You take them through the
           basement or through the subway. You
           keep them off the streets. I need a
           perimeter as far back as 39th.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           Why the hell should I take orders from
           you?
          Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST
          is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops
          watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The
          Sergeant turns to his officer.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           I need men in those buildings, lead the
           people down and away from the streets.
           I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

          EXT. SKY LINE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher
          and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

                          IRON MAN

                          (TO JARVIS)
           We got his attention. What the hell is
           step two?!
          IRON MAN flies away.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its
          throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and
          STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and
          WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,
          until...
          Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,
          firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.
          They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           What's the story upstairs?

                          THOR
           The powers surrounding the cube is
           impenetrable.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Thor is right. We gotta deal with these
           guys.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           How do we do this?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           As a team.

                          THOR
           I have unfinished business with Loki.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah, get in line.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight
           focused on us and that's what we need.
           Without him these things could run
           wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna
           need us...
          Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he
          looks around the city.

                          BANNER
           So, this all seems horrible.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I've seen worse.

                          BANNER
           Sorry.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           No. We could use a little worse.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark? We got him.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Just like you said.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing
           the party to you.
          IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing
          still.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I... I don't see how that's a party...
          IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also
          swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that
          keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.
          Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good
           time for you to get angry.

                          BANNER
           That's my secret, Captain. I'm always
           angry.
          Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

          SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.
          Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.
          IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready
          to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT ­ LARGE
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and
          withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          raises his SHIELD to block them.
          From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in
          horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

          UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

          SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          Loki watches below, motionless.

                          LOKI
           Send the rest.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, THOUSANDS MORE OF CHITAURI SOLDIERS AND EVEN

          MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Guys.

                          IRON MAN
           Call it, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Alright, listen up. Until we can close
           that portal up there, we're gonna use
           containment. Barton, I want you on that
           roof, eyes on everything. Call out
           patterns and strays. Stark, you got the
           perimeter. Anything gets more than
           three blocks out, you turn it back or
           your turn it to ash.

                          HAWKEYE
           Wanna give me a lift?

                          IRON MAN
           Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
          IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
           that portal. Slow them down. You've got
           the lightning. Light the bastards up.
           (Thor flies up; to Natasha)
           You and me, we stay here on the ground,
           keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

          THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH

          UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

          HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,
          THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

          THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

          IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

          MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

          OUT OF ALTITUDE.

          EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ­ DAY

          Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJÖLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A
          BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

          MJÖLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

          THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

          IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

          DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction
          going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir. The council is on.
          OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow
          of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven
          AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,
          EXPLODING a RIDER.

                          HAWKEYE
           Stark. You got a lot of strings
           sticking to your tail.

                          IRON MAN
           Just try and keep them off the streets.

                          HAWKEYE
           Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
           Find a tight corner.

                          IRON MAN
           I will roger that.
          IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in
          HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the
          CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER
          TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Nice call. What else you got?

           HAWKEYE (V.O.)
           Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down
           on 6th.

                          TONY
           And he didn't invite me?

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

          We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit
          around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then
          another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,
          mesmerized by what lies beyond.
          WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

          Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK

          CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,

          POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO

          WAVE OFF THE HULK.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a
          CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its
          throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands
          there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
           damn thing if we don't close that
           portal.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Well, maybe it's not about guns.
           (gestures the flying

                          CHARIOTS)

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You wanna get up there, you're gonna
           need a ride.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I got a ride. I could use a lift
           though.
          BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts
          and angles his SHIELD.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are you sure about this?

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

          BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR

          MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

          SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

          FLYING CHARIOT.
          [Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in
          one extended shot.]
          - BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret
          shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS
          her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a
          building.
          - IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS
          following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who
          fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND
          BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as
          a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.
          - From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends
          one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

          IRON MAN.
          - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK

          BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE
          SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,

          THOR RAISES, DRAWING LIGHTNING TO IT FROM ALL SIDES, AND BRINGS

          IT DOWN WITH A FINAL, TERRIBLE BLOW--

          INT. HISTORY MUSEUM ­ DAY

          The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR
          and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after
          bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR

          WITH HIS ENORMOUS HAND. THOR GOES FLYING. HULK SMIRKS.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          SELVIG WAKES UP FROM LOKI MIND CONTROL. He looks around,
          confused where he is. He looks up at the sky, amazed.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,
          FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a
          SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap
          BREAKS ITS LEG. He stands up, pickingup his SHILED.

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,
           they caught a lot of civilians there.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm on it.

          INT. 42NDBANK ­ DAY

          Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and
          uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,
          pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

          BEEPS.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD
          at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their
          rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at
          them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while
          BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.
          A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS
          HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Everyone! Clear out!
          CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and
          just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,
          trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA
          through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians
          look up from below. They're okay.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE BANK ­ CONTINUOUS

          Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The
          police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.
          A WAITRESS looks back, thankful.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the WORLD

          SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           Director Fury, the council has made a
           decision.

                          NICK FURY
           I recognize the council has made a
           decision, but given that it's a stupid
           ass decision, I've elected to ignore
           it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Director, you're closer than any of
           oursubs, you scramble that jet...

                          NICK FURY
           That is the island of Manhattan,
           Councilman. Until I'm certain my team
           can't hold it, I will not order a
           nuclear strike against a civilian
           population.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           If we don't hold them in the air, we
           lose everything.

                          NICK FURY
           I send that bird out, we already have.
          Fury shuts off his viewscreen.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at
          her side. She looks about, wondering whose ENERGY FIRE it was
          she looks behind.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Oh. You.
          LOKI FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing
          between buildings. They RACE MADLY, driving and dodging.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks at BLACK WIDOW, astonished.

                          HAWKEYE
           Nat, what are you doing?

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Uh... a little help!
          HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it
          at Loki, smiling.

                          HAWKEYE
           I've got him.

          FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S

          HEAD...

          SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

          AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...

          BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO

          THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.
          BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of
          the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the
          edge.

          EXT/INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

          As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS
          LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He
          COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to
          attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,

          STANDING UP TO THE HULK.

                          LOKI

           ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH

           ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND

           I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...

          HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR

          REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,

          FLATTENING LOKI.

                          HULK

           PUNY GOD.

          LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,
          weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is
          firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the sky.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Doctor.

                          SELVIG
           Loki's scepter, the energy...the
           Tesseract can't fight. You can't
           protect against yourself.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           It's not your fault. You didn't know
           what you were doing.

                          SELVIG
           Well, actually I think I did. I built
           in a safety to cut the power source.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Loki's scepter.

                          SELVIG
           It might be able to close the portal.
           (Selvig looks down. He sees a

                          GOLD GLEAM)
           And I'm looking right at it.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the
          hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes
          through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting
          off SOLDIERS.
          IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his
          LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we will lose power before you cut
           through that shell.
          IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster.

                          IRON MAN
           JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of
           Jonah?

                          JARVIS
           I wouldn't consider him a role model.

          IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY
          ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.
          IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The
          wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming
          sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,
          holding out their rifles.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE turns to fire HIS LAST ARROW. Using his bow as a staff,
          he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow
          off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his
          GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,
          HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building
          and CANNONBALLS in.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them
          down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER
          OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES

          THEM LIKE HE'S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. BLOCKING THE STREAM

          OF STREAKING BLASTS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.

          NICK FURY RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG-
          7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The
          jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED.
          Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there,
          knowing he can't do anything about it.

                          NICK FURY
           Stark, you hearing me? We have a
           missile headed straight for the city.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           How long?

                          NICK FURY
           Three minutes, at best. Stay low and
           wipe out the missile.

          IRON MAN fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain.

          CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BATTLE, SIDE TO SIDE. Cap and Thor both
          throw their respected weapons. Thor catches MJÖLNIR, but as Cap
          turns, an ENERGY BLAST strikes him down hard. Thor runs over to
          a broken car, swings the hammer and flips the car over and over
          on its side, crushing a few CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          Cap tries to get up. Thor helps him back to his feet. Cap raises
          his SHIELD back up.

                          THOR
           You ready for another bout?

                          BLACK WIDOW

          IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The
          missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it
          tightly.
          With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course.
          Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight
          up into sky, towards the portal.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

          Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as
          they too watch IRON MAN fly up into the portal.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,
          suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.
          The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate
          with Tony. NOTHING.

          EXT. SPACE

          We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled
          with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them
          hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.
          IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the
          blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.
          The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,
          causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a
          spectacular heavenly display.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS
          KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE

          Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the
          TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.

          Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by
          Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.
          The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.
          Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
          different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his
          sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint
          climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ DAY

          Fury is facing once more members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #3
           Where are the Avengers?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not currently tracking their
           whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a
           leave of absence.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           And the Tesseract?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is where it belongs: out
           of our reach.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           That's not your call.

                          NICK FURY
           I didn't make it. I just didn't argue
           with the god that did.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           So you let him take it and the war
           criminal, Loki, who should be answering
           for his crimes?

                          NICK FURY
           Oh, I think he will be.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           I don't think you understand what
           you've started. Letting the Avengers
           loose on this world. They're dangerous.

                          NICK FURY
           They surely are. And the whole world
           knows it. Every world knows it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Was that the point of all this? A
           statement?

                          NICK FURY
           A promise.

          Fury walks out, towards the bridge.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out
          into the world.

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, how does it work now? They've gone
           their separate ways, some pretty
           extremely far. We get into a situation
           like this again, what happens then?

                          NICK FURY
           They'll come back.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           You really sure about that?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Why?

                          NICK FURY
           Because we'll need them to.

          Agent Hill turns around. Fury looks out, smiling.

          FROM SPACE, a view of the EARTH. The vibrant BLUE of its
          OCEANS is striking against the vast BLACK VOID of space.
          MOVE CLOSER TO THE EARTH, where the shimmering PACIFIC OCEAN
          meets the CALIFORNIA COASTLINE...
          A bird's-eye view of LOS ANGELES comes into relief-- a criss-
          cross of streets, freeways. The buildings not more than dots.
          Keep MOVING CLOSER as SOUND FADES IN.
          We notice MOVEMENT through the sprawl of city now: MASSES OF
          PEOPLE and CARS moving AWAY FROM THE OCEAN as we arrive at...

          EXT. PICO BLVD. - GROUND-LEVEL - DAY

          The SOUND is at a frantic pitch here-- The sound of CHAOS on
          the streets. People SCREAMING, CAR HORNS BLARING as CARS
          jockey for position, moving eastward among...
          HORDES OF PEOPLE on foot, their PANICKED FACES rushing past.
          SUPER: LOS ANGELES-- CONTACT + 1 HOUR as we...

          SUPER: MARINE CORPS BASE, CAMP PENDLETON. OCEANSIDE, CA.
          Then SUPER: THE DAY BEFORE...
          We are CLOSE ON: SERGEANT MICHAEL NANTZ late 30s, tall,
          battle-hardened, staring forward, listening impatiently.

          1ST SGT. ROY (O.S.)
          Must be some kind of mistake...
          Company 1st SERGEANT JOHN ROY, also late 30s, sits behind his
          desk, holding Nantz' file. Smiles.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          I got paperwork here, with your
          signature, says you're retiring.

          SGT. NANTZ
          No mistake, John.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          My ass. You got a box full a',
          medals, file full a' commendations.

          Hell, everything but the Good

          They can take the Good Conduct

          See, that's what I'm talking about,
          Mike. You're a marine!
          Nantzsmiles back now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I appreciate it, John. You know
          that. But, I been to too many
          funerals. Had to visit too many
          moms and dads, tell 'em about what
          happened to their sons...

          BEAT.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          Look. You're on that training
          assignment right now. Why don't
          you just ride it out for a month or
          two. See how you feel...

          SGT. NANTZ
          I did my twenty. I'm done.
          Roy takes this in, nods. He stands, holds his hand out.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          You're gonna miss it.
          Nantz shakes.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Wanna bet?

          Looking out onto ROLLING HILLS and TREES... We hear (O.S.) :

          VOICE #1 (O.S.)
          I don't see it...

          VOICE #2 (O.S.)
          I'm telling you, it's in the trees.

                         FIVE MARINES
          From the 1st Platoon, 2nd battalion, 5th Marines (the 2/5)..
           Camo uniforms, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES on, stare into the DARK.
          CPL. CORREGGIO, 20, linebacker-big, shakes his head,
          frustrated.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Screw it. I'm gonna launch another
          one...
          The other marines back away quickly as...
          WIDEN to see we're...

          EXT. OFFICER'S GOLF COURSE / CAMP PENDLETON - NIGHT

          Correggio, GOLF CLUB in hand, steps to a golf tee. WHACK.
          He tees off.
          The marines follow the ball as it sails into the darkness.

          CPL. CORREGGIO -
          That's more like it.
          PVT. LENIHAN, 18, baby-faced, looks impressed.

           PVT. LENIHAN
          Sweet.
          PVT. IMLAY, 19, a dense but good-natured country boy, moves
          to the tee.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Don't encourage him. Correggio's
          freakin' ego's big enough already.
          He takes the club from Correggio.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Let an expert show you how it's
          done, bro.
          Imlay TEES OFF, his swing plainly choppy, uncoordinated.

          POV THROUGH IMLAY'S NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
          As he WHACKS THE BALL, visible in the night vision's greenish
          glow. It HOOKS into a sand trap.

          PVT. IMLAY (O.S.)
          Mother fu...

          Then he stops as a LIGHT flashes beyond the trees.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Foot mobiles. 3 O'clock.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Told you they'd come!
          THREE GIRLS, 19-21, signal with a FLASHLIGHT. Then race down
          a small hill onto the golf course.

          EXT. GOLF COURSE - LATER

          The THREE GIRLS sit around a beat-up TAHOE parked near the
          tee, CASE OF BEER on its back gate, sipping beers.
          Corpsman ADUKWU, 20, a tall, thin Nigerian, TEES OFF.

          PVT. IMLAY
          That dog'll hunt! Damn, Daktari,
          you can play!

                         ADUKWU

                         (THICK ACCENT)
          We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Well, how would I know? I mean,
          it's an American game.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Actually, Imlay, it's Scottish.
          PVT. KERNS, 19, an antsy fireplug of a guy, shakes his head.

          PVT. KERNS
          Lenihan, you as good with an M-16
          as you are with your mouth?

          PVT. IMLAY
          Kerns. Lay off him.

          PVT. KERNS
          What? Just wanna make sure the
          rookie won't fold under fire.
          Correggio shoves a beer into Kerns' hand.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Relax, dude.
          He throws an arm around Kerns' shoulder, smiles at the girls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          My buddy's jumpy 'cause he got an
          assfull a' shrapnel our last tour.

          PVT. KERNS
          I'm jumpy? You're crawling up your
          own ass 'cause we train with Sgt.
          Nantz tomorrow.
          Correggio eyes Kerns. This was the wrong thing to say.
          One girl, smiling seductively, steps to Correggio, takes the
          golf club.from him.

                         GIRL #1
          If this is the officer's course,
          what happens if they catch you out
          here?
          She readies to take a shot. Correggio snuggles up behind
          her, ostensibly teaching her how to swing.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          We can handle it, baby. We're
          experts at night maneuvers.
          Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu.

                         GIRL #2
          So you're from where again?
          Imlay pops a beer, interrupting.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Nigeria. Adukwu's our corpsman.
          Like a medic. Saved Kerns' ass.

                         (TO ADUKWU)
          Daktari, tell her about Nigeria.
          Adukwu starts to talk, but Imlay interrupts again:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Adukwu's a green card marine...
          (motions to Lenihan)
          And Lenihan here-- He's just green.
          Mom signed so he could join at 17.
          I'm looking after him since he
          don't know his ass from a hot rock.
          Lenihan suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up.

                         GIRL #3
          You're doing a good job.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Yeah. We always take the new meat
          out here to christen 'em...
          Lenihan shuffles back out from behind the Tahoe.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Hey, barfy. Grab your beer.
          toast.
          Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly.

          PVT. IMLAY
          To Lenihan. Who gets his first
          taste a' those hills tomorrow.
          He points off to the HILLY, DESOLATE TERRAIN near the course.

          PVT. KERNS
          Good luck, rookie.
          The marines chuckle knowingly, about to drink...
          Then they hear the sound of TIRES skidding to a halt. They
          look toward the hillside, see the WHITE HELMETS'of MPs.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          MPs!
          The marines grab the goggles and clubs, pile...

          INTO THE TAHOE
          With the girls. The Tahoe skids away, the beer CRASHING off'
          the back. The first girl eyes Correggio.

                         GIRL #1
          Experts, huh?
          Correggio grins sheepishly. She smiles. sweetly, taking his
          hand, writing her PHONE NUMBER on the back of it as...

          INT. BEDROOM / OFF-BASE APARTMENT - SAN CLEMENTE - MORNING

          A modest working-class two bedroom apartment. A TELEVISION
          on in the b.g.. A NEWS PROGRAM:

          NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
          .what appears to be an
          unprecedented meteor shower,
          falling off the Falkland Islands.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          LT. BENNIE MARTINEZ, 25, whose youthful looks and open smile
          contrast with his muscular frame, rolls in bed to see...
          His wife, ANNA, 24, sitting on the edge of the bed next to
          him, turning something over in her hands.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          What are you doing up so early?
          She holds up the object in her hands-- It's Martinez'

          LIEUTENANT BARS.

                         ANNA

                         (OBVIOUSLY PROUD)
          Lieutenant. I still have to get
          used to that.
          She kisses him lightly, stands. Martinez smiles, watching
          her move off.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Yeah, lot of things we gotta get
          used to.
          We see her VERY PREGNANT BELLY now as she smiles back, exits.
          As she does, Martinez turns back to the TELEVISION:
          'METEORS' falling into a distant ocean.

          NEWSCASTER (V.0.)
          This dazzling display is visible
          from Argentina to Southern Chile.

          EXT. DRIVEWAY / OFF-BASE APARTMENT - LATER

          Martinez, in uniform now, exits the ground-floor apartment,
          heads to HIS CAR as Anna exits, watching him go, smiling.

                         ANNA
          Call me later.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (SIMULTANEOUS)
          I'll call you later.
          He stops, smiling back at her now. She waves coyly.
          Then Martinez is RUNNING BACK TO THE APARTMENT.
          Moving with the grace of the college football player he was
          just a few years ago.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          We don't go with him. Just observe from a distanceas...
          Martinez arrives at Anna, who laughs as he leans down,
          kissing her stomach now.

          EXT. TRAINING COURSE - MORNING

          The 1st PLATOON of the 2/5, 39 marines, all 18-23 years old,
           sweating as they RUN HILLS in FULL GEAR in the blazing sun.
          Key on the MARINES FROM THE GOLF COURSE, staring forward
          at... Nantz, running up ahead.

          PVT. KERNS
          Heard Nantz put in his papers.
          He's out.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Good. Wish he done it years ago.
          Lenihan, struggling, breathing hard, looks up at this,
          STUMBLING as he does.
          Nantz, looking back at the chatter, sees...
          Imlay grab hold of Lenihan, helping him forward now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Goddamn it, Imlay, you gonna wipe
          his ass for him, too? Every man
          carries his weight!
          Nantz drops back, runs alongside the struggling Lenihan.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Just quit, Lenihan. Do us all a
          favor. 'Cause the squad's only as
          strong as the weakest man.,..
          Lenihan STUMBLES and FALLS IN THE DIRT.

          SGT. NANTZ
          And right now you're getting us all
          killed. You hear?
          On these words, NANTZ MEETS EYES WITH CORREGGIO, further back
          in the pack. Nantz looks away, sees...
          Imlay, suddenly at Lenihan's side, helping him up. Nantz
          shoves Imlay away, knocking him onto his ass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You think you're helping him,
          Imlay!? You think you're making
          him stronger?!
          Nantz puts a boot into Imlay's chest, shoving him flat.
          Correggio stares at this, steaming.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stay on the goddamn ground, Imlay!
          You've just been gut-shot.

                         (TO LENIHAN)
          Your buddy's down, bleeding to
          death, Lenihan. LZ's at the top of
          this hill. You gonna let this man
          die in the dirt on some stinking
          hill? Or are you marine enough to
          save him?!
          Lenihan stumbles to his feet, wiping dirt from his mouth.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          I'm gonna save him, sir!
          Lenihan bends, strains, somehow heaves Imlay up.
          He begins STUMBLING UP THE HILL, carrying Imlay on his back.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Come on, goddamnit! It's a hot LZ!
          The chopper's gotta move! They're
          gonna leave you BOTH to die!!!
          Lenihan staggers, knees trembling, weaving back and forth.
          Then his foot comes down on a ROCK IN THE TRAIL. His ANKLE
          GIVES WAY. Lenihan falls, yells in pain, grabbing his ankle.

          SGT. NANTZ

          GET UP!!!

          PVT. LENIHAN
          I can't.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Don't you ever tell me you can't!
          Correggio takes a step towards Nantz now. Kerns stops him.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          He's injured, Sergeant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          A moment as they stare at each other. Nantz, voice like ice:

          SGT. NANTZ
          He's not injured. He twisted his
          goddamn ankle.
          Nantz' looks over the men, sweaty, covered with grime.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We are marines. "Can't" is not the
          code we live by. "Can't" gets
          marines killed. Do things the
          right way, the marine way, maybe
          you get to come home... Maybe your
          buddy gets to come home.
          Correggio stares back sullenly on this.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Dying's easy, ladies. Everything
          else takes balls.
          Nantz spits on the ground.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Adukwu. Run a bag of saline into
          Lenihan and tape that ankle. We
          start back in ten minutes.

          INT. FLOWER SHOP DAY

          We recognize two marines from 1st platoon: CPL. DEVREY
          HARRIS, 22, African-American, steely, quick-witted, and CPL.
          NICK STAVROU, 23, a Greek hulk with an easy smile.
          Harris stares at a TELEVISION on a table behind the counter.

          NEWSCASTER (V.0.)
          .meteors are falling off the
          coasts of California, Ireland,
          India, in the Bay of Bengal-- all
          less than ten miles from land...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Man, I thought Lenihan was gonna
          wash out today.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hey, I remember carrying your fat
          ass up that hill hung over as shit.
          Newbie gets no sympathy from me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          A woman, CHERISE, 22, Harris' fiancee, hurries over.

                         CHERISE
          For three hundred more, she said we
          could have sprays of lilies. I
          know it's a lot, but it'd be so
          beautiful. What d'you think, baby?
          Harris looks pained. But before he can speak up:

          CPL. STAVROU
          Well, I think it's a no-brainer.
          You're only getting married once!
          What, are you gonna worry about
          three hundred bucks?
          Cherise looks expectantly to Harris, who smiles back weakly.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Of course, baby. Whatever you want
          She kisses him, heads to the florist as Harris turns on

                         STAVROU:

          CPL. HARRIS
          Dude, what are you doing?

          CPL. STAVROU
          Busting your balls.

                         CHERISE

                         (CALLS OVER)
          Tomorrow we shop for cake.
          Stavrou throws an arm round Harris' shoulder, smiles.

          CPL. STAVROU
          I love cake.

          INT. CAMP PENDLETON / PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

          A drab, nondescript office. Kerns sits across a desk from
          the BASE PSYCHIATRIST, who's consulting a FILE.

                         PSYCHIATRIST
          Still not sleeping... And the
          nightmares?

          PVT. KERNS
          No. I mean, sometimes. But it's
          no big deal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         PSYCHIATRIST
          You're not drinking, right,
          private? That's just a crutch...

          PVT. KERNS
          Alcohol? No, sir. Definitely not.
          The psychiatrist stares at this. Then WRITES in the file.

          PVT. KERNS
          So... What's my status? Am I
          cleared for combat? I feel good.

                         PSYCHIATRIST

                         (STILL WRITING)
          Let's meet again next week.

          EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - RED BEACH, CAMP PENDLETON

          Two surfers-- CPL. GRAYSTON, 23, looking grizzled beyond his
          years, and PVT. SIMMONS, a spaced-out surfer vibe, sit on
          boards in the water, staring at...
          TWO MPs, on the beach, waving them in.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          I don't know why they always have
          to give us shit. It's not fair.

          CPL. GRAYSTON
          Question is, why does everybody
          think life's supposed to be fair?
          Why do bad guys want to kill us?
          Why can't I have a nipple ring?
          Why is it the more power we get,
          the more we want? Nothing's fair,
          Simmons.

          PVT. SIMMONS

                         (SMILES)
          Whatever, Corporal. I just like to
          blow shit up.
          Suddenly, a SIREN begins WAILING from the base. Grayston and
          Simmons exchange a glance. They start paddling in quickly.

          EXT. TRAINING COURSE - DAY

          Nantz is running with another platoon of MARINES. Everyone
          slows as the SIRENS WAIL from the base.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hold.
          The squad stops, following Nantz' gaze to...
          An approaching dust cloud, being kicked up by...
          A HUMVEE and TWO FIVE-TON TRUCKS
          Speeding up the dirt road toward the marines.
          Everyone is silent as they watch the HUMVEE and TRUCKS pull
          up... This is not normal.
          1st Sergeant Roy hops from the Humvee, shouting:

          1ST SGT. ROY
          Marines! Into the trucks. Now.
          Proceed to the armory and draw
          weapons.
          The marines exchange glances, heading for the five-tons.
          Roy motions to Nantz, who follows him to the Humvee.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What's going on, John?

          1ST SGT. ROY
          Look, Mike, I know you're burnt
          out, ready to move on... Whatever
          you want to call it. But
          everybody's being deployed right
          now. And the platoon's down a
          sergeant. We need you.

          SGT. NANTZ
          For what? Do I have a choice here?
          They arrive at the Humvee. Roy turns to Nantz.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          No. You don't. It's all hands on
          deck, Mike.
          Nantz nods, resigned. Starts climbing into the Humvee.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Just don't lose my paperwork.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          INT. HUMVEE - MINUTES LATER

          Roy drives back to base, Nantz next to him. SIRENS are
          wailing, HELICOPTERS TAKING OFF in the distance.

          1ST SGT.. ROY
          Meteor storm's hittin' up and down
          California now... All I know is,
          this is a helluva lot more than
          just some space rocks fallin' out
          to sea...

          SGT. NANTZ
          What d'you mean?
          He turns., stares at Nantz.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          Whole base is being mobilized.
          There's some kinda' bad shit
          hittin' the fan.

          EXT. CAMP PENDLETON - MINUTES LATER

          The Humvee and five-tons swing into the base past a mass of
          activity: TRUCKS being loaded with supplies, TANKS driving
          onto flat cars, MARINES racing about.

          INT. HUMVEE - SAME


          1ST SGT. ROY
          You're assigned to 1st platoon,
          under Lt. Bennie Martinez. His
          platoon sergeant was rushing back
          to base, got in a car accident.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What are the odds?
          As the Humvee pulls to the COMMAND BUILDING, Nantz sees...
          LT. MARTINEZ hurrying to meet them.

          1ST SGT. ROY
          There's the lieutenant. Young,
          been with us three months, straight
          outta basics school. Bright kid,
          but this is his first deployment,
          so keep an eye on him, Mike.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          INT. DORM ROOM - BACHELOR ENLISTED QUARTERS - SAME

          Lenihan and Imlay, Correggio and Kerns are getting their gear
          together, hurriedly packing.
          Lenihan checks and double checks a LIST with the contents of
          his pack, ticking off 'poncho liner,' 'gore-tex jacket,'
          'socks,' 'vest,' 'first aid kit,' flashlight'...

          PVT. KERNS
          It's probably just a drill, right?

          PVT. IMLAY
          They shifted Nantz into our unit.
          Something must be going on.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          I heard Nantz kicked ass on his
          last tour. Went into a compound by
          himself, killed, like, ten
          insurgents...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          That what you heard? You don't
          know shit, Lenihan.
          Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the door.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Move your asses. They want us in
          the armory.
          And he's gone. Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          What's his problem?

          PVT. IMLAY
          Nantz lost a lotta guys on that
          tour. Correggio's brother was one
          of 'em.
          Lenihan nods, somber, getting it.

          INT. HALLWAY / BASE COMMAND BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

          Nantz and Martinez walk through quickly. All around them,
          NUMEROUS OFFICERS hurry, all responding to RINGING BEEPERS.
          Nantz peers into VARIOUS OFFICES. Every one is buzzing with
          activity: Clerks bustling, maps spread out, phones ringing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          And every office has a TELEVISION on. We hear OVERLAPPING.
          REPORTER'S VOICES from the offices they pass:

          TV REPORTERS (V.0.)
          .cluster of what appears to be
          meteors is tightly packed... hard
          for scientists to predict the size
          or quantity striking the oceans...

          SGT. NANTZ
          They calling us.in because of these
          meteors, Lieutenant?

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I assume so... Maybe an evacuation.
          Whatever it is, it'll be good to
          get out in the field with the men.
          Nantz looks askance at this. Martinez catches it.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Look, Sergeant, let's be clear. I
          know your rep, know what you've
          done... But this is my unit. We're
          not gonna have a problem, are we?

          SGT. NANTZ
          No problem, sir. It's all yours.

          INT. ARMORY - DAY

          At numerous windows,. LINES OF MARINES hand in weapons cards,
          receiving their weapons in return. Among them...
          The marines from 1st Platoon of the 2/5 (Correggio and Kerns,
          Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and Lenihan, Adukwu), all watching:
          MOUNTED TELEVISIONS-- A WOMAN REPORTER, 20s, on a BEACH.
          Behind her, POLICE disperse thin CROWDS of PEOPLE, bullhorns
          blaring. A legend on the TV screen reads 'SANTA MONICA, CA.'
          PVT. MOTTOLA, squad radio man, tall and thin, listening to an
          IPOD, and PVT. GUERRERO, lumbering, eyes on the TV.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          We never got a chance to finish the
          new mix, man. We were gonna add
          some metal to it...

          PVT. GUERRERO
          We'll have time later.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          The marines stare at the harried reporter on TV.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          .National Guard troops have flown
          in to evacuate all surrounding
          beach areas...

          PVT. MOTTOLA

                         (TREPIDATION)
          Yeah... Later.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM / CAMP PENDLETON - LATER

          Nantz and Martinez crowd in among other SERGEANTS and
          LIEUTENANTS, the COMPANY CAPTAIN briefing them.

                         CAPTAIN
          These objects were completely
          undetected until they entered our
          atmosphere.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          So... what are they, Captain?

                         CAPTAIN
          We have no idea. But whatever they
          are, they're not hitting the water
          at terminal velocity. They're able
          to slow down before impact.
          Glances exchanged in the room now.

                         CAPTAIN
          This is no meteor shower. Homeland
          Security has bumped the threat
          level to red. Marines, we are the
          first line of defense. All units
          gear up, be ready to move.

          INT. ARMORY - LATER

          The young marines from 1st platoon are still in line for
          their weapons along with many OTHER MARINES. Some are
          nervously bullshitting, others intently watching...

                         THE TELEVISION:
          The REPORTER on the beach looks harried now as THICK SMOKE
          rolls in across the water. POLICE SIRENS wail in the b.g.

                         I

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          .some sort of smoke has appeared
          over the ocean now...

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hey, shut up. Shut up!
          Others quiet down now. All focus slowly shifting to...

                         THE TV:
          The reporter on the beach is cupping her earpiece.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          I'm being told a Coast Guard cutter
          just issued a Mayday...
          The TV SHOT PANS to the WATER...
          The DISTANT CUTTER lists to one side, SINKING below the waves
          as indistinct DARK SHAPES clamber onto it from the water.

                         THE MARINES
          Push forward, scrambling to the TVs.

          PVT. KERNS
          What the hell are those things?!

          ON THE TV:
          The CUTTER DISAPPEARS behind the thick rolling SMOKE.
          The camera PANS back to the REPORTER, silently staring out.

          2/5 PARADE DECK / CAMP PENDLETON - SAME
          Crowded with MARINES, including squad leader Grayston, all
          getting ready. Or they were...
          Right now, ACTIVITY HAS CEASED. Marines silently stare at...

                         TELEVISIONS
          The REPORTER ON THE BEACH staring out, clearly panicked.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          It appears... the cutter has...
          She stops, seeing the SMOKE reach the WATER'S EDGE. A HUSH
          falls over the CROWD as SMOKE rolls across the beach.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          INT. HALLWAY / COMMAND BUILDING

          Formerly bustling... Now all OFFICERS and MARINES are frozen,
          crowding around open office doors, staring at...

                         TELEVISIONS
          As the REPORTER reacts to isolated SHOUTS echoing from the
          crowd on the beach. Some are pointing out to the ocean...

          REPORTER (ON TV)
          What is that...? In the water...
          The news cameraman PANS to the WATER as it begins to CHURN.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM / CAMP PENDLETON - SAME

          Nantz and Martinez stand among the other sergeants and
          lieutenants staring, stunned, at...

                         A TELEVISION:
          SCREAMS and panicked voices ring out from those ON THE BEACH
          now as INDISTINCT FIGURES appear from under the waves.
          PEOPLE RACE AWAY, plodding along the sand in hopeless flight
          as these FIGURES charge into the crowd...
          GUNSHOTS ring out, police shooting at the INDISTINCT FIGURES
          that appear, then disappear in the EVER-THICKENING SMOKE.
          MOVE IN ON NANTZ, staring at the TV as...
          The news cameraman RUNS away now, the PICTURE being
          transmitted growing shaky, indistinct, frenzied as...
          A DARK FIGURE appears, overruns the cameraman as...
          The NEWS CAMERA suddenly cuts to BLACK. In black, all we
          hear is SCREAMS echoing from the beach.

          EXT. CAMP PENDLETON AIR FIELD - MINUTES LATER

          All activity has doubled, a frantic energy now. TRUCKS race
          along the perimeter of the air field, massive CH-46
          HELICOPTERS TAKE OFF loaded with MARINE UNITS...
          The 1st platoon stands together, Lt. Martinez addressing them
          as ANOTHER CH-46 HELICOPTER is landing nearby.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          As you probably heard, Sgt. Nantz
          will be taking over for Sgt. Beck.
          We're lucky to have him aboard.
          The CH-46 helicopters TOUCHES DOWN now, its massive,, bay door
          opening for them. Martinez barks:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Let's move, men!,
          The platoon grabs gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing
          aboard. Nantz hurries them along, grabbing packs, throwing
          them on after the marines.
          Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on...
          Correggio grabs it back from Nantz.
          Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You got something to get off your
          chest, Corporal?

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          No. It's cool, Sergeant. You got
          a Silver Star and my brother came
          home in a box. I get it.
          Beat.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get aboard, Corporal.
          Correggio jumps into the chopper.

          INT. CH-46 TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - LATER

          IN FLIGHT. The marines, helmets on, packs between their
          knees, sit facing each other.
          The sound of the CH-46's massive rotors is deafening. Some
          shout over the din, too nervous to remain quiet.

          PVT. GUERRERO
          What the hell you think those
          things are?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Gotta be extraterrestrial.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          PVT. IMLAY
          You mean, like, from space?!

          CPL. STAVROU
          No, Imlay. From Canada.
          Correggio looks down at his hand... Sees the GIRL'S PHONE
          NUMBER written on it.
          ACROSS THE DECK, Martinez huddles with Nantz, MAP in hand.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Santa Monica airport's our Forward
          Operating Base. We get some Cobras
          and F-18s in the air, we'll have
          plenty of support.
          Nantz nods. They're flying into the unknown and Martinez
          seems as nervous as the younger men.
          Kerns leans in to Nantz, desperately needing reassurance.

          PVT. KERNS
          How many a' them you think there
          are, Sergeant?
          Nantz just stares out, stone-faced.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We'll know soon enough, private.

          INT. CH-46 TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - LATER

          The marines are glued to the windows, shocked by what they're
          seeing as the chopper BANKS toward Venice/Santa Monica:
          FIRES raging from various explosions. In the distance,
          MASSIVE LINES of TRAFFIC moving away from the ocean.
          The STREETS bordering the beach look deserted-- Except for
          the BODIES dotting the landscape.
          Nantz looks at Martinez, who is hunched over, scribbling a
          LETTER. Martinez folds it, then writes the name ANNA on it.
          We realize it's a letter in the event of his death.
          Martinez stares at the letter. Then carefully tucks it away.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/FORWARD OPERATING BASE - LATER

          The airport is being quickly transformed into a military
          base: MILITARY VEHICLES line the runway, more being driven
          from a nearby CARGO PLANE.
          The CH-46 LANDS.
          The platoon JUMPS OUT, squad leaders forming the men up as...
          Nantz and Martinez salute a CAPTAIN heading to them as F-18
          JETS take off, screaming overhead.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Lt. Martinez, sir. 1st Platoon of
          the 2/5.

                         CAPTAIN
          Situation is as follows: Most of
          Santa Monica is cleared of
          civilians. We've got a defensive
          line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile
          from the ocean...
          He points out LINCOLN BOULEVARD on a MAP, the OCEAN close by.

                         CAPTAIN
          At 9 p.m., everything from Lincoln
          to the ocean will be bombed.
          Martinez blanches.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          We're... leveling it, Captain?

                         CAPTAIN
          We've got an infestation of god-
          knows-what. It's an enemy ground
          force only, they have no aircraft.
          So our jets'll tear 'em a new
          asshole. We will rule the air.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          But... there must be civilians
          stuck behind the line, sir.

                         CAPTAIN
          That's affirm. We're getting
          distress calls, sending squads out.
          He points to the MAP, to streets running from Lincoln Blvd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         CAPTAIN
          Your mission, Lieutenant, take your
          1st squad, proceed west from
          Lincoln to a community center
          located here...
          (pointing to map)
          In a park on 10th and Bay Street.
          Police were using it as an
          evacuation point. They got
          overrun. Get there, any civilians
          you find, get 'em back here to the
          FOB for evacuation. You got three
          hours.
          Another CHOPPER is LANDING. Nantz yells over the sound:

          SGT. NANTZ
          What do we know about these things,
          Captain?

                         CAPTAIN
          Not much. But police have shot
          'em. They bleed.
          The captain, hurrying to the next chopper, yells back:

                         CAPTAIN
          It's our job to kill 'em.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          Nantz and Martinez are double-timing with the 1st squad (Cpl.
          Grayston, Correggio and Kerns, Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and
          Lenihan, Mottola and Guerrero, Simmons and Adukwu).
          As they approach Lincoln, they slow, eyes widening.
          REVERSE to see what they're staring at:
          LINCOLN BOULEVARD. Being fortified into a defensive line.
          MARINES are setting up sand-bagged MACHINE GUN NESTS in a
          parking lot fronting a nail shop and a China Express.
          Other MARINES hunker behind barricades in front of a Goodyear
          Tire Store, firing MORTARS toward the ocean.
          RUBBLE. BURNING BUILDINGS. Smashed-in storefronts. Cars
          CRASHED at intersections, the echoing WAIL of CAR ALARMS.
          Pockets of CIVILIANS are being waved forward by MARINES. A
          LITTLE GIRL with a Smurf backpack is rushed across Lincoln.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          Martinez turns, rallies the squad, most of whom look shocked.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Let's go, marines! Clock's
          running. Focus on the mission.
          We're gonna get to that community
          center and get those people safe.
          A COBRA ATTACK HELICOPTER screams overhead, firing into the
          distance. Martinez turns to Nantz, shouting over the din:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Something to add, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          (to the squad)
          Kill anything that's not human.

          EXT. 10TH STREET - LATER

          Nantz and Martinez lead the squad FROM LINCOLN onto 10th St.
          Various STRUCTURE FIRES are visible in the distance.
          The squad passes a FIRE TRUCK crashed against a fence, engine
          idling. FIREMEN lie near their hose lines, dead.
          Suddenly... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Deep, deafening sounds
          exploding in the distance.
          The ground SHAKES from massive AFTERSHOCKS. Billowing SMOKE
          rumbles from the west. Ash rains,down, the sky turns black.
          The squad hunkers down, panicked looks exchanged.

          PVT. KERNS
          What the hell is that?!

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Keep it together. Watch your
          angles.
          The aftershocks fade. Ominous quiet again.
          The squad continues DOWN THE STREET.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Helluva way to get citizenship, eh,
          Daktari?

                         ADUKWU
          Shit, I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          THICK SMOKE hangs in the air. The lack of visibility is
          clearly adding to the marines' fright.
          Numerous SHAPES become visible in the smoke.
          As the squad approaches slowly, the shapes become clear...
          BODIES splayed in the street.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Cherise and I were supposed to
          register at Bed, Bath & Beyond
          tonight...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Think you're gonna be busy, bro.
          Nantz points his rifle into a CRASHED PICKUP TRUCK. A BODY
          is slumped beneath the wheel.
          Simmons comes up behind Nantz. Peers into the truck:
          Sections of the BODY appear almost dissolved by a white
          phosphorous-like substance.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          What is that shit, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          (caustic, dismissive)
          Something bad, private. Now get
          back with your team.

          PVT. KERNS
          Whoa, whoa... Contact! Twelve
          o'clock!
          A SHAPE is moving to them through the smoke.
          The marines aim, about to fire just as the smoke clears...
          A DOG. Standing there, staring mournfully at them.
          Nervous chuckles now. Correggio sidles up to Kerns.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Relax, man.
          Kerns just shoots him a look. The squad moves on.
          As they approach a SIDE STREET that intersects 10th...
          The DOG WHINES. Correggio pets it, trying to comfort it...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          But the dog suddenly RACES OFF, disappearing into the smoke.
          The marines spin, rifles up, growing unnerved...

          PVT. IMLAY
          What the hell...?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Something spooked that dog...
          Then Kerns sees the SMOKE SWIRLING DOWN THE SIDE STREET...
          As if something is racing through it.
          Kerns breaks formation, SPRINTS DOWN THE SIDE STREET, FIRING.

          PVT. KERNS
          Contact! Contact!
          Discipline shatters as the squad follows Kerns...

          DOWN THE SIDE STREET.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Marines! Hold your position!
          Kerns stops, spinning, looking. for targets, breath ragged,
          eyes panicked. Correggio races up.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          What'd you see?!
          Suddenly, the INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears
          through the smoke, moving FAST down the side street.
          Kerns is ready, FIRING. The others react, FIRING as well.
          The ALIEN FORM is blasted, DROPPING into the smoke.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
          Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns' face.

          SGT. NANTZ
          One enemy runs and you break
          discipline and chase it?!
          (to the others)
          Think, marines. Stay alive.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          The sergeant is right. Stay on
          course. We have a mission...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          Suddenly, the SHADOWY ALIEN FORM RISES again, darting off,
          disappearing into the smoke.
          The squad stares back, stunned.

          CPL. STAVROU

                         (QUIETLY)
          Holy shit.

          CPL. HARRIS
          How many rounds it take?

          CPL. STAVROU
          Enough.
          Correggio edges to Kerns, who's looking panicky.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You okay?

          PVT. KERNS
          They're real, bro. I kept prayin'
          they wouldn't be...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Quiet.
          Nantz, unnerved himself, stares into the smoke...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          What is it, sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          That thing running down the
          street... That was to draw us in...
          Slowly, fading in, we hear what Nantz hears now...
          A RUMBLING SOUND BEHIND THEM. Building. Nantz spins to it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          They're coming. We took the bait,
          now they're cutting us off.

          PVT. KERNS
          I can't see a goddamn thing!
          But the SOUND of their ADVANCE tells us there's many.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Light it up!
          The squad lets loose with a barrage of FIRE as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          TRACER FIRE shoots back at the marines from the smoke.
          Glimpses of INDISTINCT FIGURES moving fast.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Mottola, get on the radio. See if
          we can get some air support.
          Mottola starts working the radio, trying to remain calm as.'..
          PROJECTILES EXPLODE in BRIGHT FLASHES around the marines.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          Contact front! Contact front!
          Correggio, frustrated, peers through the smoke.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          What are we shooting at?!

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Lieutenant. Command says air power
          is totally committed. Enemy
          contact all over the area...
          Martinez stares back at this ominous news as...
          The MARINES FIRE back into the THICK SMOKE. But the enemy
          attack keeps INCREASING in ferocity.
          One PROJECTILE hits a wall above Lenihan. It EXPLODES, some
          kind of liquid splashing onto him. Lenihan grimaces.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Ahh, shit! It's burning!
          His HELMET is being eaten away by the liquid. Imlay is
          immediately at Lenihan's side, pulling the helmet off.
          Lenihan's skin is blistering, oozing.

          PVT. LENIHAN

                         (PANICKED)
          My face, man...! How's my face?

          PVT. IMLAY
          Ugly as ever, bro.
          The squad hunkers down, trying to find any cover-available--
          behind cars, trees.
          Martinez drops BEHIND A CAR, pulls out his MAP, checking it
          for escape routes.-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Chaos as ENEMY TRACER FIRE increases, exploding around them.
          Martinez looks desperate, forced to FLEE FROM COVER by the
          alien fire.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (SHOUTS)
          Fall back! Here!
          He leads them further down the side street.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We can hold this position,
          Lieutenant!

          LT. MARTINEZ
          We're gonna get pinned down!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Sir, these things seem to be
          operating tactically! Don't let
          them dictate your decisions...

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (SHOUTS)
          Move to live, marines!
          The squad follows Martinez, retreating...

          INTO A 'WALK' STREET.
          JUST A SIDEWALK separates the houses opposite each other.
          A moment. SILENCE. Nantz looks at the heavy FOLIAGE, dense
          SHRUBS and TREES on both sides. He knows:

          SGT. NANTZ
          It's an ambush. This is the kill
          zone!
          Nantz slings his COMBAT SHOTGUN forward.

          SGT. NANTZ

          FIRE!
          On Nantz' order, the SQUAD OPENS FIRE just as...
          ALIEN FIRE EXPLODES from the THICK COVER of bushes and trees.
          Nantz leads the brutal counterattack, PUMPING and FIRING his
          combat SHOTGUN.
          Martinez is shouting orders, directing the men as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          Kerns backs against a fence, overwhelmed by the chaos. ; He
          aims, shoots. Then he freezes.
          Correggio steps in front of Kerns, firing to protect him.,
          Lenihan takes a hit from the enemy tracer fire explodingâ
          around the marines. He's blown back into thick bushes as...
          THE REST OF THE SQUAD battles fiercely.
          An alien PROJECTILE slams into Cpl. Grayston'S ARM. The
          SPRAY OF LIQUID bubbles out from the wound.
          Then something grabs Grayston through the bushes...
          Nantz sticks his SHOTGUN into the bushes, fires. BOOM. And
          Grayston is suddenly free. Nantz drags him into...

          THE FRONT YARD OF A HOUSE.
          The squad follows, Correggio pulling Kerns into the yard.

          THEY BACK TOWARD THE HOUSE.
          Guerrero, Imlay and Simmons lay down an awesome barrage with
          powerful SAWS (Squad Automatic Weapon), covering.the retreat.
          Trees and bushes are shredded, houses are splintered.
          All this mayhem allows the squad to...

          BARGE THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE.
          Pandemonium. The marines are sweaty, bleeding, scared.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          Jesus! Oh my God!

          CPL. STAVROU
          Keep your shit together!

          PVT. SIMMONS
          What the hell are those things?!

          CPL. HARRIS
          They're the goddamn enemy.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Yeah, and there's a million of 'em!

          PVT. SIMMONS
          Where'd they come from?! Why'd
          they come here?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Everyone... just calm down.

          PVT. SIMMONS
          Calm down?! We keep shooting
          them... Why don't they die?!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stow that shit, Private.
          (turns, to the others)
          Watch the yard. Secure the back.
          We're not dyin' here today.
          The marines take up firing positions at windows and doors.

          CORREGGIO EYES KERNS.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You okay?
          Kerns stares back, deer in the headlights. He nods.
          ADUKWU IS WRAPPING GRAYSTON'S ARM as Grayston fumbles for a
          CIGARETTE. Adukwu lights it for him.

          CPL. GRAYSTON
          I know. These things'll kill me.
          Adukwu smiles. Grayston stares at his arm, ironically:

          CPL. GRAYSTON
          Hell, now that just ain't fair.
          Nantz moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded
          Grayston and Guerrero.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Sir, what are your orders?
          Martinez turns, stares at Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I led us right into that ambush.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Sir. Your orders.
          Beat. Martinez nods.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Let's figure out how we get out of
          here. We'll medevac the wounded
          from that park.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Nantz nods, turns to Mottola.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Radio the FOB. Get us a medevac at
          that park by the community center.
          As Mottola works the radio, he's startled to see Guerrero,
          who has been SLASHED across both eyes.

          PVT. GUERRERO
          I can't see, Motorola.
          Mottola, horrified, steadies his voice.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          You'll be okay.
          A slight beat. Then...

          PVT. GUERRERO
          You're one shitty liar, bro.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Hey, where the hell is Lenihan?!
          Everyone stops, stares.

          EXT. BACK YARD OF DIFFERENT HOUSE - SAME

          Lenihan, pressing a hand into his side, BLOOD oozing between
          his fingers, peers INTO THE BACK YARD at...
          A SWIMMING POOL, its water gently lapping. A GARAGE nearby.
          Lenihan, startled by the SOUND of ALIENS RUNNING in the alley
          behind the house, takes cover BY THE GARAGE.
          He struggles to remain calm. Then the sound FADES. He
          waits. Silence. Lenihan starts to edge,out as...
          A BANG rings out on the far side of the garage.
          Lenihan spins back behind cover, eyes desperately searching.

          INT. HOUSE - SAME

          Nantz shoulders his M-16. Martinez eyes him.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          All right. We'll package the
          wounded, then rally on 10th street.

                         (TURNS)
          Mottola, Imlay. Go with the
          sergeant.
          The two quickly step to Nantz.

          PVT. IMLAY
          We got your six, Sergeant.
          Anything you need.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What I need is for you to keep
          quiet. And stay close.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Right. Got it. Quiet.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Starting now, Private.
          As Nantz turns, Mottola slaps Imlay in the helmet.

          INT. BACK YARD OF DIFFERENT HOUSE

          Lenihan creeps around the garage, spies a SIDE DOOR leading
          into it. He grabs the handle. Mercifully, the door opens.

          INT. DARK GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Lenihan falls INTO THE DARK GARAGE. Boxes and old furniture.
          Just one dirt-stained WINDOW on an opposite wall.
          Lenihan crouches in the dim light, coughs, spitting up blood.
          He turns on his radio, says into it:

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Motorola? You copy?
          His RADIO buzzes back with Nantz' voice:

          SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)
          Lenihan. This is Sgt. Nantz...

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Sergeant, Jesus, I had to turn the
          radio off..'. These things are
          everywhere!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          EXT. ALLEY - SAME

          Nantz is MOVING, with Mottola and Imlay. covering.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (INTO RADIO)
          We're coming for you, Lenihan.
          What's your location?

          INT. GARAGE - SAME

          Lenihan looks across the garage, out of the window...

          PVT. LENIHAN
          I'm in a garage... I can see two
          palm trees right next to it. House
          is white with black shutters...
          Just as something BANGS against the garage.

          SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)
          Is the house a two-story?
          Lenihan stares, his eyes going wide, panicked.

          SGT. NANTZ (V.O.)
          Lenihan, is the house a...?
          Lenihan CLICKS the radio OFF.
          Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His
          breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear.
          Lenihan sees the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the
          window, as if something just brushed past it.

          EXT. STREET - SAME

          Nantz, Mottola and Imlay moving through the thick smoke...
          Nantz still trying to raise Lenihan on the radio.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lenihan...? Lenihan...?
          Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears. He
          hears something...
          The marines freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as...
          Nearby, they hear SOUNDS of aliens running... Somewhere...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          The marines crouch, weapons up, straining to see through the
          smoke. They remain stock still. Then...
          The sound fades into the distance.
          Nantz looks at the men. Motions. They creep forward as...

          INT. GARAGE - SAME

          Lenihan moves TO THE WINDOW, searching the garage floor,
          desperate not to step on anything that would make noise. He
          edges forward to peer through the dirty glass. Then...
          THUD THUD THUD. More NOISES... On the garage roof now.
          Lenihan looks up, panicked as...
          CRASH! The WINDOW suddenly CRASHES IN.
          Lenihan spins, FIRING wildly, lighting up the garage as...
          He stumbles to the door, fumbling for the handle, falling...

          EXT. BACK YARD OF HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          .OUT OF THE GARAGE. Lenihan staggers back, eyes darting
          along the garage roof, gun aimed.
          Nothing there.
          As Lenihan continues backing away, peering through the
          drifting smoke at the garage, he's unaware that BEHIND him...

          A SHADOWY ALIEN FORM IS RISING FROM THE POOL.
          Lenihan doesn't see it, but he senses it. He turns, FIRES...
          A SPLASH as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back INTO THE
          POOL, disappearing under the water.
          Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool.
          He peers over the pool edge...
          An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on the bottom of the pool.
          Lenihan is transfixed a moment. Then he raises his rifle to
          punch more rounds into the thing as...
          WHOOOM! The creature launches OUT OF THE WATER!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          BLISTERING GUNFIRE! As Nantz, Mottola and Imlay burst into
          the yard. They fire, as does Lenihan.
          The fusillade of bullets tears the creature up.
          The marines STOP FIRING as the alien falls to the ground.
          They stare amazed at the 7 ft. tall ALIEN CORPSE... Rigid
          skeleton bursting out of its skin, some strange layer of
          machinery intertwined with its flesh.

          CPL. MOTTOLA
          Oh my God... What the hell are
          these things?

          PVT. IMLAY
          They're butt ugly, that's what they
          are.
          Nantz grabs onto Lenihan, noticing his wound.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna get you to the medevac,
          Private.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Thank you, Sergeant. Thanks for
          coming for me.

          SGT. NANTZ
          But Lenihan...

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Yes, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Ever get separated from your unit
          again, I'll find you and shoot you
          myself.

          PVT. LENIHAN
          Yes, Sergeant.
          Imlay slings Lenihan's arm around his shoulder and they're
          instantly moving, RUNNING FROM THE YARD.

          EXT. SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          The men meet up with the others. Adukwu and Kerns carrying
          Grayston on a litter, Simmons holding onto the blinded
          Guerrero, guiding him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          All right, let's get to the
          community center...
          They head off, Simmons still supporting Guerrero as THWACK!
          An alien projectile slams INTO SIMMONS' THROAT. Choking, he
          CRUMPLES to the ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless.
          Panic. The marines spin, searching for targets.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Move! Grab Simmons! Go, go!
          Stavrou hoists Simmons as the marines run off, FIRING to
          cover their retreat, as...
          The SILHOUETTES of DARK ALIEN FORMS are visible on distant
          rooftops, watching the rifle squad disappear down the street.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          Nantz, Martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently
          through the street, supporting their wounded. They take
          cover behind cars, peering out to see...
          The PARK in the distance. A wide open FIELD with a COMMUNITY
          CENTER BUILDING on the far side.
          There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems
          strangely quiet.
          Then, out of the smoke, an IMAGE APPEARS... Something MOVING

          AT THEM...
          The marines all shift, aim forward, about to blast away as...
          FOUR MARINES come into view, moving ghost-like.
          Nantz signals with his flashlight. The marines hurry over,
          silently falling behind the cars.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          You guys are 2/5?

                         MARINE
          2nd squad, 3rd platoon...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Where's the rest of your unit?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARINE
          This is it, Lieutenant. Everyone
          else is dead or missing.
          The news hits Martinez hard. He eyes Nantz.

                         MARINE
          We were on the street, like, ten
          minutes and they ambushed us. As
          soon as we radioed for help, it's
          like they were everywhere...

          PVT. MOTTOLA

                         (ON RADIO)
          Medevac's incoming, lieutenant.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          All right. Stay with us.
          And the squad moves out...

          EXT. PARK - MOMENTS LATER

          A large FIELD stretches from the street to a squat BUILDING,
          the COMMUNITY CENTER.
          The specter of LIGHTS is thrown onto the field, an other
          worldly effect until we realize the lights are coming from...

          A MEDEVAC HELICOPTER
          Descending steadily, its thundering rotors whipping the air..

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Load the wounded. Sgt. Nantz, Cpl.
          Harris-- let's find the civilians.
          Martinez, Nantz and Harris run to the community center as...
          The WOUNDED are hustled to the CHOPPER as it TOUCHES DOWN.

          INT. LOBBY OF COMMUNITY CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          The marines burst in, looking around. To the right, a GYM.
          To the left, a HALLWAY with numerous side rooms off of it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!
          A clattering. The marines immediately move toward it,
          peering down the dark hall...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Then the DOOR to a side room OPENS to reveal...
          A WOMAN, MICHELE, 28, staring out, looking shell-shocked.

          SGT. NANTZ
          How many of you?
          A MAN, JOE RINCON, 45, jacket and tie, behind her.

                         MICHELE
          There's five of us. Three kids.
          Nantz is immediately moving.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Where? Where are the kids?
          He pushes past the adults, sees TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, 8-10.

          EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD

          The marines run up to the chopper with the wounded. INSIDE
          THE MEDEVAC they see WOUNDED laid across the helicopter's
          cabin. A CREWMAN in the medevac yells over the din:

                         CREWMAN
          You called in with two wounded!

          PVT. IMLAY
          We got four!

                         CREWMAN
          Can't take four! We have no room!

          CPL. STAVROU
          Make goddamn room!
          A beat. The crewman relents in the face of Stavrou's
          impressive bulk, tries to make room.
          Imlay and Stavrou get Simmons and Grayston on.
          Mottola helps Guerrero in, squeezing his hand.

          PVT. GUERRERO
          I'll work on that mix for you.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Thanks, dude. Think I'm gonna need
          it.
          Lenihan crawls onto the chopper's deck with Imlay's help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          PVT. IMLAY

                         (SMILES)
          You just had to get outta the shit.
          Lenihan smiles back.

                         CREW CHIEF
          Now! We're moving now!
          Imlay bumps fists with Lenihan, backs away as...

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz runs out with the BOY. Followed by Martinez and
          Harris, hustling the two GIRLS out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Wait! Stavrou, hold it! KIDS!
          Stavrou tries to hold the chopper, screaming at it as...

          THE MEDEVAC RISES.
          Nantz, Martinez and Harris run to the chopper with the kids.
          The marines around the medevac are screaming up at it, trying
          to hold it, but to no avail.
          The CHOPPER GAINS ALTITUDE as suddenly...
          BOOM! A SHOCK WAVE OF ENERGY FIRES from the west as...
          The MEDEVAC takes a DIRECT HIT.
          The devastating energy wave blasts it END-OVER-END...
          The massive helicopter CRASHES INTO A HOUSE blocks away,
          exploding, as...
          Nantz turns ominously as an unearthly BUZZING SOUND FADES IN.
          LIGHTS are ADVANCING from a street leading to the field.
          As the SOUND and LIGHTS BUILD, Nantz runs to the other
          marines to get them off that field.
          He pulls on them, urging them to the COMMUNITY CENTER doors.
          They REACH THE COMMUNITY CENTER, fall into it just as...
          Glowing through the heavy cover of smoke... The STROBING
          LIGHTS of some strange ALIEN AIRCRAFT zooming overhead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          Speeding toward Lincoln. FIRING PULSING WAVES OF ENERGY,
          lighting up the distant sky.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

          The marines and civilians fall into the large entryway. The
          marines are breathing hard, looking stunned.

          PVT. KERNS
          Goddamn flying saucers now...?!

                         ADUKWU
          All those guys on the chopper...

          PVT. IMLAY
          Why'd those bastards have to come
          down here and start this shit?!

          SGT. NANTZ
          That is not relevant, Imlay!
          They're here. They're trying to
          kill us. Kill them first!
          Martinez eyes Nantz on this. Then barks orders:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Secure the perimeter! Stavrou,
          give me an ammo check. Cpl.
          Correggio, take three men, set up
          an Observation Post on the roof.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You heard the lieutenant. Move!
          The dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see
          in their FACES that it's a very different fight now.
          Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC ABLAZE out a window. His
          solemn stare hints at a growing desperation.
          Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly:

          LT. MARTINEZ
          They got air power, too... Knocked
          that medevac right out of the sky.
          So much for ruling the air.
          Nantz just keeps staring out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Listen, Sergeant. These men are
          scared. A little compassion would
          go a long way...
          Nantz turns on Martinez now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          How's that gonna help them survive,
          Lieutenant?

                         (BEAT)
          I'll lead these marines. But don't
          ask me to get close to them.
          Nantz walks off.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

          Marines on post, watching various windows and doors.
          Imlay kneels by the kids, who look devastated by the day's
          events. Imlay wets a rag with water from his canteen, wiping
          the dust and dirt from the kids' faces.
          The younger girl, KIRSTEN, 8, begins crying. She suddenly
          hugs Imlay.
          Imlay, startled by this, looks uncomfortable at first. Then
          hugs the little girl back, smiling at the older.girl, ANY,
          10, Kirsten's sister.

                         AMY
          You're not gonna leave us, are you?
          A beat. Then Imlay smiles.

          PVT. IMLAY
          No way, sweetheart.
          The woman, Michele McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling
          for composure, eyes constantly moving to the kids.
          Mr. Rincon, a calm, watchful air about him, stands with his
          son, HECTOR, the kid who Nantz had carried to the chopper.

                         RINCON
          My son and I came here... There
          were only three cops, spread pretty
          thin... Then those things attacked.
          Police couldn't stop them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What happened to everyone?

                         RINCON
          I don't know. Most people ran. We
          hid in a side room, found Michele
          and the girls... Couldn't see what
          happened. Just heard... Screams.

                         MICHELE
          I have my nieces for the week. My
          sister and her husband are in
          Hawaii for their anniversary... Is
          it safe there? I heard this is
          happening in other places...
          Martinez is at a loss for words.

                         MICHELE
          What do they want from us? Why are
          they here?

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I...don't know. Right now, our job
          is just to get you to safety, okay?
          Harris appears from the hallway.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Lieutenant, something you should
          see...

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER / BACK DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

          The door opens. Nantz and Martinez edge out with Harris. As
          they peer into the smoke drifting past the building, an IMAGE
          becomes clear...
          An ALIEN BODY. On the ground nearby. Ripped by bullets.
          They step to it cautiously, realizing... IT'S NOT QUITE DEAD!
          The alien MOVES, turning as if to stare back at them.
          Without a word, Nantz lifts his rifle, shoots it in the head.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - SAME

          Hector sits with Kirsten and Amy, digging candy Nerds out of
          his backpack. He turns to the other kids, holding the box
          out. Both kids reflexively accept handfuls of candy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         44
          Then Hector notices Imlay standing nearby.

                         HECTOR
          Want some Nerds?
          Imlay holds his hand out. Hector shakes candy into it as...
          Nantz enters, calling to Adukwu:

          SGT. NANTZ
          Adukwu, bring your kit.
          Adukwu is immediately up, moving to Nantz.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna cut one of these things
          open. See if we can figure out
          what makes 'em tick.
          Michele overhears, offering:

                         MICHELE
          Maybe I can help, sergeant. I'm a
          vet...

          SGT. NANTZ
          You're a veteran?

                         MICHELE
          (can't help but smile)
          No, a veterinarian.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Oh... Okay. Well, thanks, um...
          Nantz has forgotten her name. She smiles.

                         MICHELE
          Michele.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Right. Michele.
          (smiles, embarrassed))
          Sorry.
          Mottola walks up.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Sergeant. Can't raise anybody on
          the radio. We're cut off.
          Off Nantz' look...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP

          Kerns, Correggio and TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are on watch,
          peering down to the street from opposite sides of the roof.
          All on edge, exhausted, dirty. No one says a word.
          Correggio eyes the other marines. They exchange an 'all-
          clear' sign. Then Correggio pulls up a radio.

          CPL. CORREGGIO

                         (INTO RADIO)
          O.P. reporting. We're clear up
          here.
          Correggio and Kerns look over the destroyed streets, smoke
          and flames rising from buildings in the distance, glimpses of
          white phosphorous raining down. A beat, then...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          .fucking aliens.
          Kerns looks at Correggio, starts to chuckle at the absurdity
          of it all. Then Correggio laughs. It's infectious. It's
          desperate. Then the laughter slows. Stops.

          PVT. KERNS
          You think those things get scared?
          They're probably just grunts like
          us. Probably dumped into battle,
          told to go fight...
          Kerns looks out... The constant thud and crack of warfare...
          A city crumbling. V

          PVT. KERNS
          I thought I could handle it...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You are handling it. Thing I'm
          worried about is Nantz.

          PVT. KERNS
          Sergeant saved our ass at that
          ambush... He knows what he's doing.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Yeah? Tell my brother that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.6 .

          INT. SIDE ROOM / COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER

          Nantz enters with Michele and Adukwu. Stavrou and Harris are
          in the room with Martinez. They step aside, revealing... The
          ALIEN BODY on the floor.
          Michele stops, stares. She and Adukwu are both taken aback
          at the sight of one of these things up close.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You sure you can do this?

                         MICHELE
          I was more sure two minutes ago.
          She looks to Adukwu. They step to the body together as...
          Nantz approaches Martinez.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What's the plan, Lieutenant?

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Mission is still to get the
          civilians to the Forward Operating
          Base. We've got a battalion there,
          all that firepower... I was
          thinking, I saw a bus couple of
          blocks back on 11th...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Maybe we should stay on foot.
          Martinez looks at Nantz. Then opens a MAP, pointing to
          'Santa Monica Airport' on it.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          The FOB is here, at the airport...
          That's miles to cover with those
          kids... And those bombs are gonna
          drop in a little more than an hour.
          (thinking, deciding)
          We've got to move fast.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We have no radio contact, nothing
          to let us know the best route to
          take... And a bus is a big target.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I made the call, Sergeant. It's my
          responsibility.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Beat. Then Nantz nods, turns.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs
          recon on a.bus. It was abandoned
          two blocks south off 11th...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          If it runs, get it back here.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Can you hotwire a bus?

          CPL. HARRIS
          (gestures to Stavrou)
          He's from Jersey, sergeant.
          A nod from Nantz on this.

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP - MINUTES LATER

          Correggio and Kerns are surveying the street. Correggio
          pulls the RADIO up, talks quietly into it:

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Stavrou, Harris...

          INT. EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - SAME

          Stavrou and Harris peer out an EXTERIOR DOOR as they hear
          Correggio (V.0.) from the RADIO:

           CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
           .you're clear down 11th Street.
          They exchange a quick glance.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Every day a holiday, buddy...

          CPL. HARRIS
          .every meal a feast.
          They slip outside, running off silently.

          EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP - SAME

          Correggio and Kerns watch Harris and Stavrou run down the
          street, covering them with their M-16s.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. SIDE ROOM - LATER

          Adukwu and Michele, scalpels in hand, hover over the alien
          body. Its thick leathery skin has been sliced open.
          Martinez and Nantz observe, Imlay on post nearby.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          How's it going?

                         ADUKWU
          Well, Lieutenant, I'm a medic, Dr.
          McDermott's a vet... We weren't
          sure who was most qualified to cut
          this thing open.
          Martinez smiles.

                         ADUKWU
          Look. It's been surgically
          modified...
          He pulls tissue aside, revealing where the alien's 'gun' is
          attached to its arm.

                         ADUKWU
          Part of its arm has been amputated
          to fit this weapon.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Talk about commitment to cause.
          Adukwu examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the
          alien's 'heart' would be. Thick, fleshy veins run from it.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          What is that thing?

          PVT. IMLAY
          He's from Nigeria, Lieutenant. Not
          a different solar system.
          Nantz looks over at Imlay.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Thank you, private.
          Adukwu twists the cap. It comes free, revealing...
          A GELATINOUS ORGAN. Slimy, viscous fluid seeping from it..
          Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Whoa, that stinks!
          Everyone steps back except Michele, that is. Unfazed, she
          takes her scalpel, makes an INCISION across the organ.

          PVT. IMLAY
          I'm gonna puke. Swear to God, I'm
          gonna puke!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Whatever you do, do it quietly,
          Imlay.

          EXT. STREET - SAME

          Stavrou forces the door of a METRO BUS open, climbs INTO THE
          BUS, ducking below the steering wheel as...
          Harris covers, staring off to the FAR STREET. Tree branches
          there cast LONG SHADOWS which sway with the breeze. Then...
          The indistinct FORM of an ALIEN scout appears in the shadows.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hey, Stavs...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Relax. First thing I wired was a
          school bus. Trying to impress this
          Betty. She had a huge rack...

          CPL. HARRIS
          Enemy scout. Move your ass.
          Stavrou doesn't look up. Just works diligently.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Don't rush genius.

          EXT. ROOF - SAME

          Correggio and Kerns remain still, peering into the distance.

          PVT. KERNS
          Shit. You seeing what I'm seeing?
          Correggio pulls BINOCULARS...
          POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: A SIDE STREET, TREES overhanging it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          Movement. ALIEN SHAPES massing on the side street.
          Appearing and disappearing through the smoke and trees.
          Then the POV THROUGH BINOCULARS PANS to pick-up...
          The BUS. Nearby. In the path of the alien movement.
          Correggio grabs the RADIO. Says:

          CPL. CORREGGIO

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Harris. Movement, 1500 meters up
          11th.
          Suddenly, a loud BANG rings out below them.

          PVT. KERNS
          What the hell was that?!
          They exchange glances with the other marines across the roof.
          All four move quickly, converging on one side of the
          building, look down the side of it...
          An EXTERIOR DOOR leading into the center is BROKEN OPEN.

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER SIDE ROOM - SAME

          Michele finishes her incision, carefully PEELS A SECTION OF

          THE ORGAN BACK.
          Something vaguely METALLIC is revealed within it.
          As Michele touches her scalpel to it, it SPARKS.
          Then starts rhythmically GLOWING.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Looks like it's receiving a
          signal...
          Suddenly, the ORGAN CONVULSES rapidly. Expanding,
          contracting.
          Nantz sees the ALIEN'S GUN VIBRATING now, the whole arm
          TWITCHING, spreading through the alien's body like a seizure.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          This thing's still alive!
          Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO
          THE ORGAN, twisting viciously.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          The organ stops vibrating. The glow fades. The body slumps.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Not so hard to kill when you know
          where to aim.
          Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic.

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Lieutenant. There's a breach.

          INT. HALLWAY / COMMUNITY CENTER - SECONDS LATER

          The marines step from the side room with Michele. They peer
          up and down the dark hallway, listening...
          OTHER DOORS along the hall take on an ominous presence now.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (LOW)
          They in the building?

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          No clue, Sergeant. An exterior
          door was broken open.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lieutenant. Maybe we should gather
          the civilians in the gym.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Good idea, Sergeant.

          INT. / EXT. BUS - SAME

          Stavrou, still beneath the wheel. Harris, eyes on the street
          as the RADIO crackles with Correggio's VOICE:

          CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
          Harris, hostiles advancing right at
          you. Approximately two hundred
          meters and closing...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Done!
          Stavrou hops into the driver's seat, tries to start the bus.
          It doesn't turn over.
          Harris and Stavrou exchange a quick glance. Stavrou drops
          below the wheel again...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

          More ominous BANGS ring out from down the long hallway,
          BUILDING in intensity.
          Nantz stands, staring DOWN THE DARK HALL with his M-16,
          surprised as Martinez steps up next to him.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          We're in it together, Sergeant.
          Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          C'mon, Mottola. Get that bus here!
          Mottola is on the radio, frantic:

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Where the hell is that bus?!

          INT. BUS - SAME

          Stavrou is still underneath the wheel. Harris looks out to
          see ALIENS rounding the corner in the distance.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Get this thing started.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Hey, why didn't I think a' that?

          INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - SAME

          CRACK! Down the hall, the sound of a door splintering...

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're out of time!
          Martinez looks INTO THE GYM, sees the kids staring back.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Go! Get 'em out!
          Imlay swings the GYM DOOR OPEN, moving the civilians out.

          IN THE LOBBY
          Nantz and Martinez stand together, aiming at the hall as...
          A final BANG... We hear a door being BURST OPEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Nantz, in the front, exchanges a glance with Martinez at the
          ominous sight of...
          A PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE rising in the distance.

          THEY SPIN ONTO LINCOLN BOULEVARD.
          Screech to a halt at the obstacle course of BATTLE WRECKAGE
          strewn across the street.
          Noxious BLACK SMOKE is rising from BURNING HUMVEES and
          TRUCKS. Smoking CRATERS pothole the street.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (SHOCKED)
          Jesus Christ. Those alien ships
          took the whole line out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We've got forty minutes 'til they
          level this area.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (TO STAVROU)
          Get us to the Forward Operating
          Base. Fast.
          Stavrou lays on the gas, speeding away as, in the back, the
          other marines stare out. Mottola peers into the sky...'

          PVT. MOTTOLA
          Where the hell are all our jets?

          EXT. BUS (MOVING) - SIDE STREETS, SANTA MONICA

          The bus snakes through jammed streets, abandoned cars, bombed
          out buildings.

          INT. BUS -SAME

          Martinez is in the front with Stavrou, Nantz in the middle of
          the bus, hovering near the civilians sitting on the floor.
          Rincon holds Hector, Michele with her arms around both girls.
          Marines on the seats above, weapons ready.
          Nantz hears Imlay whispering to Harris:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Why the hell'd the lieutenant wanna
          take a bus? We're sittin' ducks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

          SGT. NANTZ
          (low, hard)
          The call's been made, private. You
          so eager to decide the fate of all
          these people?
          Imlay is stone silent.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Didn't think so.
          Then Nantz looks up, meeting eyes with Martinez as...
          A NOISE in the distance now. A low VIBRATION, building.
          Nantz moves to Martinez. They peer out of the front.
          LIGHTS fill the sky, heading east. As they approach...
          The VIBRATION gets louder and louder, shaking the bus now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Everybody get down, weapons inside
          the bus. Make no noise.
          The men pull their guns in from the windows, crouching as low
          as possible, straining to see, hear...
          The vibrations grow louder, LOUDER! Suddenly... WHOOSH!
          An ALIEN AIRCRAFT rips overhead.
          Then another, and another, and another... All heading east.
          The image of their speed, their power, their other-
          worldliness is overwhelming, devastating.
          Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies
          on. Leaving them behind. Until...
          Suddenly, Mottola's RADIO BLARES!

                         COMMAND

                         (FROM RADIO)
          All stations this net, urgent
          traffic. Multiple enemy aircraft
          moving east...
          As the transmission rings out, Nantz looks up to see...
          One ALIEN SHIP split from the armada, TURN BACK TO THE BUS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          It's coming back...!
          The children scream, marines agitated... all hear a low
          vibration, echoing off buildings, heading their way.

          SGT. NANTZ
          (staring at the radio,

                         REALIZING)
          Kill that radio!
          Mottola turns off the radio.
          The alien aircraft STOPS. Hovers a moment.

          SGT. NANTZ
          They're tracking our signals! All
          radios, cell phones-- keep
          everything off!
          Everyone stares silently, tensely. Then...
          A single BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly shines from the alien craft.
          Then the alien aircraft MOVES FORWARD again. Slowly. But
          still heading their way.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          It's still coming... It's
          searching...
          Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO.
          He looks around the bus, sees the little girl, Kirsten,
          ponytail in her hair. He leans down to her.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hi. Could I have your, uh, hair
          thing?
          She stares, wide-eyed, at this fearsome, sweating marine.

                         KIRSTEN
          My... pony holder?
          Nantz nods. She pulls the PONY TAIL HOLDER from her hair,
          hands it to Nantz. He smiles. Briefly. Heads to the front.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Anything happens, Lieutenant, get
          the SAWS up front and take off with
          these kids.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Sergeant...

          BUT NANTZ IS OUT OF THE BUS.

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz runs down the street with the radio under his arm.
          Heading toward a GAS STATION.
          Nantz glances back, sees... The ALIEN AIRCRAFT SEARCHING the
          street below, getting closer and closer to the bus as...

          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS

          Amy and Kirsten pressed under seats, Michele covering them
          up... Hector closing his eyes in his dad's arms...
          The marines duck low, gripping their weapons.
          They hear the aircraft coming closer, almost above them.
          LIGHT starts shining through the windows as...

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz, almost to the gas station, wraps the pony tail holder
          around the radio, looks back to see.
          The ALIEN AIRCRAFT STOP, HOVERING OVER THE BUS!
          Shining lights into it, scanning, scanning...

          INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

          Hector's eyes widen, staring up at the light. Michele pulls
          the girls in closer, trying to calm them, herself.

                         MICHELE

                         (WHISPERING)
          It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be
          okay, it's all gonna be okay.
          Everyone freezes as the BEAM reflects off the walls, filling
          the space with a horrible bright light, exposing them as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

          EXT. STREET BY GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz presses the "Push to Talk" button on the radio as...
          The alien craft suddenly TURNS in NANTZ' DIRECTION.
          Nantz wraps the pony tail holder around the radio, keeping
          the button on it depressed so it's SENDING A CONSTANT SIGNAL.
          He slides the radio toward one of the GAS PUMPS...
          Keeps moving, diving BEHIND A VAN across the street.
          Nantz peers around it, sees...
          The alien aircraft HEADING FOR THE GAS STATION, descending.
          Nantz slams a grenade into the launcher on his M-16.
          The alien aircraft zooms at the gas pumps, its unearthly hum
          growing louder and louder as...

          NANTZ FIRES THE GRENADE.
          The GAS PUMP EXPLODES! A MASSIVE FIREBALL HITS THE ALIEN

          CRAFT!
          Nantz flattens himself to the street as...
          The ALIEN AIRCRAFT, trailing smoke and flames, thunders out
          of control RIGHT OVER HIM...
          Then CRASHES into a building... BLOWING APART!

          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS

          Marines ducking, civilians screaming as...
          DEBRIS from the alien ship BLOWS OVER THE BUS, burning pieces
          falling to the ground...

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz runs out from behind the van, checks the remains of the
          burning alien aircraft, rifle raised.
          NO ALIEN inside. The ship is a DRONE.
          Nantz takes this in, then starts back for the bus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - SAME

          Nantz runs back onto the bus as Stavrou pulls swiftly away.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TO MARTINEZ)
          That ship was an unmanned drone,
          lieutenant. And that alien we cut
          open had something in it receiving
          signals... They must have one
          helluva command and control center.
          Martinez pulls his map out, eyes Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          That was some real John Wayne shit,
          Sergeant.
          Nantz tries to shrug it away. But Martinez nails him.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Don't do it again. We work as a
          team, Sergeant. We clear?
          Beat. Nantz nods.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're clear, Lieutenant.
          Nearby, Imlay whispers to Mottola:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Who's John Wayne?
          Martinez looks up from the map, turns to Stavrou.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take the freeway, Corporal. Cuts
          half the distance off our drive.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Sir. We get on that freeway, we'll
          be exposed...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          It doesn't seem like we're much
          safer out here. We've got two
          shitty options-- I'm choosing the
          one that gets us there fastest.
          (then, quietly)
          We don't want to be in this area
          when the bombs start to fall.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          EXT. STREET BY FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

          The bus bangs past a few stalled cars, cruising up a ramp,
          onto the freeway.

          INT. BUS (MOVING) - 10 FREEWAY - SAME

          Martinez and Nantz crouch near the front, keeping watch.
          From this elevated vantage point on the freeway, the big
          picture emerges IN THE DISTANCE:
          The BATTLE FRONT is moving east... A DEFENSIVE LINE of TANKS
          is visible, blasting away at aliens.
          SWARMS of DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18 JETS flying at them.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Jesus...

                         (TO STAVROU)
          Double time, Corporal.
          The bus barrels forward, careening BETWEEN CARS, knocking
          some out of the way.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take the next exit. Head south.
          We're two clicks from the FOB.
          The bus drives onto the shoulder, past the sea of abandoned
          cars, heading to the off-ramp.
          Nantz appears uneasy. They are exposed on this freeway and
          he doesn't like it.
          He MOVES TO THE BACK, peering out windows, checking angles.
          Michele looks up as he passes, sees a GASH on Nantz' head.

                         MICHELE
          Your head, Sergeant. You're
          bleeding.
          Nantz touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on
          his pants. Michele smiles at him softly.

                         MICHELE
          Bet when you woke up this morning,
          you didn't think your day would end
          up like this.

          SGT. NANTZ
          That's a pretty safe bet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hostiles. Back up. Now, go!
          Stavrou guns the BUS BACKWARDS, knocking abandoned cars out
          of the way...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Guess you were right, Sergeant.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Incoming! Down! Down! Down!
          A projectile EXPLODES next to the bus! Sending CARS FLYING!
          SHRAPNEL TEARS A GIANT HOLE through the side of the bus.
          TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are instantly killed, blown clear out
          of the hole. Civilians screaming...
          Stavrou hits the gas, BACKING THE BUS UP the best he can.
          An ILLUMINATION heading toward them... BOOM!
          Another projectile DESTROYS AN OVERPASS behind the bus!
          Trapped. And ALIENS are STREAMING AT THEM in the distance.
          Stavrou works the shift, grinding gears, gunning the bus...
          BEHIND A CONCRETE DIVIDER close by the COLLAPSED OFF-RAMP.
          The off-ramp now dangles precariously: a 15-foot cliff-face
          of missile-scarred concrete and re-bar.
          Martinez looks over to Nantz, not sure what to do...

          SGT. NANTZ
          (to Martinez, low)
          Let's dismount, set up a perimeter,
          get the civilians down to the
          street.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Stavrou, get down that ramp, secure
          the street! Kerns, Adukwu, help
          get the civilians off the freeway.
          Stavrou starts off the bus for the broken off-ramp.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Harris, Imlay, give us overwatch up
          on the roof. The rest of you push
          out 20 meters, set up a perimeter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          SGT. NANTZ
          And don't forget, aim chest, right!
          Imlay joins Harris, SMASHING THE SKYLIGHT out of the bus
          roof, CLIMBING OUT, taking position on the bus' roof.
          The rest of the marines EXIT THE BUS. Nantz grabs Adukwu.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stay here with the civilians. As
          soon as Stavrou gives the sign, get
          them down to the street!
          Adukwu nods. Nantz starts off the bus.

                         HECTOR
          (looks up at Nantz)
          Are we gonna die?
          Nantz turns back to Hector. Manages a smile.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Course not, kid, we're the good
          guys.
          And Nantz is off the bus.

          EXT. BUS ROOF

          Imlay and Harris, prone, propped on their elbows, Imlay
          scanning through binoculars, sees...
          30-40 ALIEN FIGHTERS coming their way.

          PVT. IMLAY
          I got about three dozen hostiles,
          twelve o'clock. 300 meters now.
          Coming fast.

          EXT. 10 FREEWAY - SAME

          Nantz stands with Martinez at the concrete barrier. Nantz'
          scans the marines' positions.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Prepare to repel. Fix bayonets!
          This might get up-close and
          personal!
          Just a low CLATTERING now, the battle-rattle of Nantz and his
          men fixing BAYONETS to their rifles. Nantz-yells out:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Cpl. Harris!

          CPL. HARRIS
          Sir!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Being vastly outnumbered provides a
          marine rifleman with what?

          CPL. HARRIS
          A target rich environment, sir!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Marines. We stand here. Let these
          bastards know who they're fucking
          with.

          PVT. IMLAY

          2/5!
          Sporadic FIRE now, as the marines fire on the advancing
          aliens, still at a distance.

          EXT. OFF-RAMP - 10 FREEWAY

          Stavrou descends down the collapsed off-ramp, negotiating the
          fractured, angled slab of roadway.
          Kerns covers him above, from the freeway.
          Stavrou hits the ground, securing the area. He looks up at
          Kerns and gives him the "All Clear" sign. Kerns takes off...

          INT. / EXT. BUS - 10 FREEWAY

          Adukwu stands in.the bus, looking out to see Kerns running
          back to them, signalling. Adukwu turns to the civilians
          crowded behind him.

                         ADUKWU
          Okay, it's clear. We're gonna go.
          Amy and Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele. She hurries
          the girls to the door of the bus as Kern runs up.

                         MICHELE
          It's okay. I'll be right behind
          you.
          Adukwu picks up Amy. Kerns picks up Kirsten.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

          PVT. KERNS
          (takes a breath, telling
          them, himself)
          It's gonna be scary but we can do
          it, okay?
          An alien round flies through the bus, shattering the back
          window! The girls scream.
          Kerns and Adukwu race away, running with the girls... Rincon
          grabs Hector. He and Michele follow...

          RUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY...
          To the off-ramp. It seems like a long way off. They run
          past Correggio, rocking a SAW full auto. The FIRE is
          deafening.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Come on!! Come on!! Get some!
          Rincon and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look
          up... They're getting closer and closer to the off-ramp as...
          Alien rounds blow chunks of concrete off the roadway...
          UP AHEAD, Kerns and Adukwu rush the girls to the EDGE OF THE
          RAMP, hurrying to get them down as...
          Rincon and Michele REACH THE OFF-RAMP now.
          Kerns grabs Hector, HELPING HIM ANGLE DOWN THE OFF-RAMP,
          getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting Stavrou as...

          ON THE FREEWAY

          BANG! MOTTOLA TAKES A ROUND TO THE SIDE.
          Rincon spins, sees the marine drop, SCREAMING.
          Rincon looks back at Adukwu, who is busy getting Michele down
          the off-ramp now.
          Then Rincon looks back to the freeway, sees Mottola writhing
          in agony.
          Rincon runs to Mottola, kneeling next to him.
          Mottola looks up at Rincon, fear in his eyes.

                         RINCON
          It's okay, son. I got you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          Rincon starts to PULL Mottola TOWARD THE OFF-RAMP...
          Struggling to get him to safety.
          Mottola's body starts to convulse. Rincon stops, tries to
          control him. Sees Mottola's eyes rolling back in his head.
          Then Rincon is horrified when he looks up to see...
          ALIENS RACING FORWARD... Heading his way!
          Moving in and out of the sea of abandoned cars.
          Rincon redoubles his efforts, pulling on the injured Mottola.
          As he does, he looks back up to see...
          The ALIENS ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF HIM now as...
          BANG! The first alien is shot by...
          Nantz, suddenly there, M-16 poised.
          Rincon looks from Nantz to... MORE ALIENS coming at them!
          No choice-- Rincon PICKS UP the injured Mottola's RIFLE.
          Scared, but resolute. He looks at Nantz.

                         RINCON
          What do I need to know?
          The slightest beat, then...

          SGT. NANTZ
          It's set to fire in three round
          bursts. We're low, so don't waste
          your shots.
          Rincon holds the M-16 against his shoulder, aiming.

                         RINCON
          Just sight down the barrel...?

          SGT. NANTZ
          And give 'em hell.
          Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in
          the distance. He squeezes the trigger...

          BY THE FREEWAY OFF-RAMP
          Adukwu sees Rincon and the wounded Mottola now. He runs to
          them, incoming rounds WHIZZ by as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          Adukwu bends over Mottola, seeing that he's dead. Adukwu
          closes Mottola's eyes as...
          An ALIEN APPEARS from behind a car, AIMING STRAIGHT AT
          ADUKWU. It is about to FIRE as...
          BAM! BAM! BAM! Rincon FIRES, blowing the alien away.
          Adukwu looks up, realizing Rincon just saved him.
          He,meets eyes with Rincon, who stares back, stunned a moment
          by his own actions. Adukwu immediately shouts a. warning.:

          PVT. ADUKWU
          Keep fighting!
          Rincon snaps back, turns to fire... A moment too late as...
          THUMP! Rincon is HIT. He falls.
          Adukwu grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian's
          eyes. Adukwu rips open packages of QuickClot, begins
          spreading the fast-clotting powder on Rincon's wounds as...,

          EXT. BUS ROOF

          Harris and Imlay firing... From this height, they can see the
          full expanse of freeway:
          More WAVES OF ALIENS coming, using abandoned cars as cover...

          CPL. HARRIS
          Shit, Lieutenant, we're gonna be
          overrun !

          BY THE BUS / ON FREEWAY
          Nantz and Martinez exchange a desperate glance on this. Then
          Nantz. looks around, assessing the situation.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Gimme two of your smoke cannisters!
          Martinez pops two canisters off, hands them to Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Take someone to cover you!.
          Nantz turns, sees Correggio. Then he turns the other way,
          sees Kerns.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Kerns! Come on!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

          PVT. KERNS
          Me, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'm not worried about fightin' next
          to you, Kerns. Now let's go.
          A slight smile from Kerns on this as he follows Nantz...
          Who sprints low, scurrying between cars... 10... 20... 30
          yards closer to the enemy.
          Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large SUV.
          Kerns ducks low, covering Nantz. Nantz crouches, opens the
          gas tank...
          Unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the
          canister aside... pulls the pin... flips the 'spoon' off...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get ready to move on my word.
          Nantz holds the fuse over the open gas cap.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Now!
          Nantz drops the fuse into the gas tank.
          They go RUNNING BACK TOWARD THE BUS as...
          B0000M! The SUV EXPLODES in a ball of flames!
          Nantz and Kerns dive BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE, Kerns crouching,
          laying cover fire. Nantz pulls a fuse.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Again! Ready?!

          PVT. KERNS
          (pops up, fires)
          Ready!
          Nantz drops the fuse, they run... The CAR EXPLODES in flames!
          Nantz runs to ANOTHER CAR, making sure Kerns is with him.

          EXT. BUS ROOF

          Harris and Imlay see what Nantz is doing...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          He's creating a WALL OF FLAME... Funneling the enemy into
          one NARROW CORRIDOR!
          Forcing them through the OPENING between the CARS ON FIRE...

          PVT. IMLAY
          Damn, Sergeant sure as shit's
          ninja. He just gave us a kill
          zone, didn't he, Corporal?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Soon as they come through, blow 'em
          back to hell!
          The first alien appears THROUGH THE BURNING CORRIDOR. Imlay
          blows it away! Harris blows away the next... It's working!;.

          EXT. FREEWAY BY BUS

          Nantz and Kerns fall back BEHIND THE BUS, next to Martinez,
          Correggio and a 2nd squad marine.
          Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the
          only ones left holding the aliens off. All FIRE forward as...
          More and more aliens begin pouring through, braving the
          flames... Into the line of fire...
          Many aliens go down. But because of their sheer numbers,
          few start to make it through, FIRING BACK at the marines.
          Martinez sees the 2nd SQUAD MARINE go down in front of him.
          Martinez rushes to his side... HE'S DEAD.
          Martinez rises to shoot and...THWUMMP. Martinez is hit.
          He looks down, blood running over his belt. Shock on his
          face. He's been shot in the stomach.
          Martinez looks around...
          The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them.
          Two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured
          metal, firing directly into the faces of their enemy.
          Martinez pulls himself together, struggling over to Nantz.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          Pull the men back... Pull 'em all
          back now, Sergeant. I'm gonna stay
          and cover.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          Nantz looks at Martinez about to say something. Sees the
          blood draining from his stomach, down his legs.
          Nantz grabs Martinez, pulling him up.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lieutenant. We gotta get you outta
          here. No way we're leavin' you...

          LT. MARTINEZ
          I said I got it...

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'm not leaving you here to die.

          LT. MARTINEZ
          That's not your call, Sergeant.
          Now get your men outta here...
          He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down
          for him. He reaches into his vest...
          Martinez hands the LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment
          between them.
          Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're pulling back. Head to the
          lower street, now! NOW!
          Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp, laying
          cover as the men head down.
          Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining
          the others running to the off-ramp. Correggio sees...
          MARTINEZ STAYING BEHIND, shooting at the aliens, drawing
          their fire.

          CPL. CORREGGIO

                         (TO NANTZ)
          What about the lieutenant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Keep movin', corporal! Go!
          All the men climb DOWN THE OFF-RAMP. Nantz turns to go back
          to get the Lieutenant himself, sees...
          Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          EXT. BUS

          Martinez, behind the back of the bus, struggles to breath,
          still drawing fire. Grabs his radio.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          This is Lieutenant Bennie Martinez',
          U.S. Marine Corps!
          Aliens converge toward the back of the bus.
          Ten... Fifteen... Twenty ALIENS heading for the signal...
          Heading for Martinez.

          LT. MARTINEZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          1st Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 5th
          Marines!
          He turns, sees Nantz coming back for him...
          Martinez pulls a smoke canister from his vest... Holds it up
          for Nantz to see...
          Then unscrews the fuse, pops open the gas cap of the bus...

          ALIENS CLOSE IN ON MARTINEZ...
          Nantz turns, dives for cover as...
          Martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank...
          A flash of fear across his face as... Aliens are on him as...

          KABOOOOOOOOOOOOM! THE BUS EXPLODES IN FLAMES!
          Massive fire ball shooting 300 feet into the sky'!
          Nantz raises his head, debris raining down, sees...

          ALL THE ALIENS DEAD.
          His eyes wide at Martinez's sacrifice, the burden now on him,
          he's in charge of the men, the civilians...
          Nantz gets to his feet. Runs for the off-ramp.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          EXT. OFF-RAMP. LOWER STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz drops down the destroyed off-ramp... Runs to the
          marines and civilians BEHIND THE ABANDONED VAN. He sees
          Adukwu working on Rincon, Hector crying in Michele's arms.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Package Mr. Rincon for transport.
          We've got to move...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Sergeant. Did you just leave Lt.
          Martinez back there?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lt. Martinez stayed behind. He
          knew he was dying...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          So you left him? Is that how it is
          with you?

          SGT. NANTZ
          He sacrificed himself to save our
          asses.
          (steps to Correggio)
          Now you get your head straight,
          Corporal. This is my unit now.
          Nantz looks at the men, who stare back, shaken.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's move. We need shelter...
          Those bombs are gonna drop!

          EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          A frantic dash through the street, rubble and fires all over.
          Marines carry the kids. HECTOR, in Harris' arms, head
          swiveling, eyes searching for his dad, sees... Imlay and
          Adukwu CARRYING rINCON, who appears lifeless.

          INT. BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS STORE - CONTINUOUS

          A dark, empty store. The marines burst in, aiming rifles.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Tighten this place down. See if we
          can establish communications. Hard
          line only! Nothing wireless.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          The marines move into position, covering windows and doors.
          Nantz turns to Michele, huddling with the kids.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Listen, we're out of the bomb
          zone... But when they fall, we will
          definitely be rocked. Make sure
          the kids are prepared for that.
          Hector suddenly breaks free, rushing forward.as Imlay and
          Adukwu enter with Rincon, setting him down.
          Nantz pulls blankets from a nearby rack, covering Rincon. As
          he does, we see a glimpse of Rincon's BLOOD-SOAKED CLOTHING.
          He is very pale. Blood flecks his lips.
          Hector stares into his father's face, eyes filling. Rincon
          touches Hector's face lightly.

          SGT. NANTZ
          It'll be okay. We'll get your dad
          fixed up.
          But when Hector looks to Nantz on this, he can't meet the
          boy's gaze. Hector can see this isn't the truth.

                         RINCON
          Listen to me, son. I'm not going
          to make it.
          (a slight beat)
          But you will.

                         HECTOR
          I don't want to go without you.

                         RINCON
          I know. But you have to. Now wait
          with Michele a minute. Let me talk
          to the sergeant.
          Reluctantly, Hector allows Michele to lead him away.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Mr. Rincon, we can take you and...
          Rincon turns to Nantz, steel-eyed.

          MR. RINCON
          Don't waste time, sergeant. You
          and I both know what's going on
          here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I can't leave you...

                         RINCON
          No. You can't take me.
          Nantz is silent, at a loss.

          ACROSS THE STORE
          Imlay stares at a CLOCK on the wall, calls out:

          PVT. IMLAY
          Four minutes and those bombs drop,
          Sergeant.
          NANTZ looks over at this. But his expression is blank.
          He turns back to Rincon, who's staring straight into him.

                         RINCON
          I keep playing it over in my
          head... If I'd done things
          differently... Maybe I could have
          gotten Hector out earlier.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You can't look back. You make the
          best decision you can...
          A beat.

                         RINCON
          Just promise you'll get my son out
          of here, Sergeant.
          Nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I promise.
          Rincon holds out his hand. Nantz takes it, meeting his gaze.

                         RINCON
          I'm trusting you with the only
          thing I have in this world.
          Nantz stares, nods.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Sergeant! Hard wire connection!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Nantz turns to see Harris behind a COUNTER, at a COMPUTER--
          an INTERNET CONNECTION on its screen.
          The marines crowd around, reading the ominous HEADLINE...
          "GLOBAL INVASION -- Alien 'Creatures' Attack From Oceans"
          PICTURES of ALIENS racing through urban streets, swarming
          over cars stuck in massive lines,of traffic...
          Underneath these pictures we see CAPTIONS, a litany-of doom:
          Battle: Tokyo... Battle: Cape Town... Battle: Los Angeles...
          Then a BUDDY LIST pops up on the screen, an INSTANT MESSAGE:
          'baby, is that you?'

          CPL. HARRIS
          Damn, that's Cherise...
          Harris quickly types back a response: 'you ok?'
          The message comes back: no, real scared.'
          Harris responds: 'where are you?'
          He hits SEND. But the message doesn't go through. He clicks
          the mouse. But the computer has frozen.
          Then 'Internet Connection Lost' pops up on screen.
          Everyone stares. Harris stands, walks from the computer.
          Stavrou watches him go as...

          ACROSS THE BIG 5 FLOOR
          HECTOR steps back to his dad's side. Rincon's eyes open
          slowly. He looks at Hector. Manages a small smile. Reaches
          out, wipes a tear from his son's face.

                         RINCON
          I'm very proud of you, son. You're
          being so brave...
          Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him
          tightly.

                         RINCON
          I love you, Hector.
          Mr. Rincon smiles. His face peaceful. Hector is silent,
          tears rolling down his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Thirty seconds!

          CPL. STAVROU
          Get away from the windows! Get
          those kids behind cover!
          The marines back away from the windows into the center of the
          store, hunkering down with the civilians. Everyone stares at
          the CLOCK on the wall as it ticks...

          PVT. KERNS
          C'mon. Fry those bastards...

          PVT. IMLAY
          Those bombs drop, then everything's
          gonna change. Get to the FOB, get
          some goddamn ammo...

          PVT. KERNS
          Some goddamn food...

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Some goddamn tanks.
          Beat. Everyone stares as... The CLOCK ticks to NINE...

          AND NOTHING HAPPENS.
          They wait. Fear grows on everyone's faces.

          PVT. KERNS
          They shoulda' dropped, right? We'd
          feel it from here, wouldn't we?

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          That much ordinance? They'd feel
          it in Nevada. Something's wrong...

          PVT. IMLAY
          Maybe it's good... Maybe we turned
          the tide...

          CPL. STAVROU
          Yeah, right, Imlay... 'Cause we
          were kickin' ass out there.

                         MICHELE
          What's happening, Sergeant? What's
          that mean?

          SGT. NANTZ
          I don't know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Adukwu quietly approaches Nantz now, voice low.

          PVT. ADUKWU
          Sergeant... Mr. Rincon is dead.
          Nantz turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father.
          It's all too much...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Jesus...
          Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing
          in on him. He turns to Michele.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Listen, our Forward Operating Base
          is about a mile away. We have to
          go on foot. I'll need your help
          with Hector now.
          Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector.
          Nantz kneels by the boy.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'm sorry Hector. Your dad...
          didn't make it. You understand?
          Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at
          Nantz.

                         HECTOR
          I don't wanna be here. I want my
          dad back. I want it all to go back
          to the way it was before...

          AT. THE FRONT OF THE STORE.
          Stavrou, eyes on the still street, sees...
          TWO ALIEN SCOUTS appear. They crouch by a car.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Sergeant, we got hostiles in front.
          All the marines stiffen, the clatter of rifles being raised.
          But Nantz, tearing up himself, just stays focused on Hector.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Me too, Hector. I wish it could go
          back, too...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          STAVROU LOOKS OUT TO THE STREET
          MORE ALIENS appear now, moving TOWARD THE STORE.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Out of time, sergeant.

                         NANTZ
          Tries to lead Hector away. Hector struggles.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (URGENTLY NOW)
          We have to go, Hector.

                         HECTOR

                         (CRYING)
          No! No! I want my dad!!!
          Nantz lifts Hector. We see Hector's face, stricken, staring
          back at his father as he's carried off.
          The other marines gather up Michele and the girls...
          And everyone is moving silently THROUGH THE STORE as...

          AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE
          CRASH! The plate glass window is SHATTERED as...
          An ALIEN smashes through it.
          The alien is very still, peering around. Then it begins to
          creep forward as...
          A SECOND ALIEN, then a third, a FOURTH follows, leaping into
          the store with sinewy power.

          AT THE REAR OF THE STORE
          Nantz peers out a BACK DOOR. It's clear. They MOVE OUT just
          as...
          MORE ALIENS leap in. They move in formation THROUGH THE
          STORE as...
          THE BACK DOOR silently shuts.

          QUICK CUT TO:

          EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

          As Nantz and the others slip out of the back...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80..

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stavrou, Harris.

          CPL. HARRIS
          Yes, Sergeant.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Blow something up.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Yes, Sergeant.
          As the others RACE AWAY down the alley...
          Stavrou takes his rifle butt, SMASHES the WINDOW of a nearby
          CAR. Reaches in... Jams the car's gear into.neutral.
          As the massive Stavrou pushes the car AGAINST THE STORE'S

          BACK DOOR...
          Harris pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE.
          Harris.slides UNDER THE CAR... Punctures the GAS TANK.
          As Harris rolls away from the FLOW OF GASOLINE...
          Stavrou LIGHTS it. Both men RUN DOWN THE ALLEY.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Don't think they'll be comin' out
          that way...
          As... BOOM! The car, blocking the door, goes up in FLAMES.

          DOWN THE ALLEY
          Stavrou and Harris FALL BEHIND A BUILDING with the others.
          NANTZ, still holding Hector, looks off to a SIDE STREET..He
          signals to Kerns and Correggio.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Check it out.
          The two marines run down the alley to the SIDE STREET.
          Nantz sets Hector down. Looks the boy in the face.

          SGT. NANTZ
          This is the hardest thing you'll
          ever have to do...
          Michele, arms around Kirsten and Amy, watches Nantz.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.1.

          SGT. NANTZ
          But we'll get through it together.
          I promise, Hector.
          Hector nods, still crying. Nantz exchanges a glance with
          Michele, who moves to Hector, comforting him.
          Nantz steps away as Kerns and Correggio run up, reporting:

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Looks good, both directions.
          Out of earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with
          fiery intensity.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We are not losing one more of these
          civilians. Period. Am I making
          myself clear?

                         (BEAT)
          Let's move.
          The group jogs silently DOWN THE ALLEY.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          Nantz leads the group down the residential street, tidy
          bungalows on either side.

          CPL. STAVROU
          You okay, bro?

          CPL. HARRIS
          I hadn't a pushed Cherise to get
          married, she'd still be in Chicago.
          Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised. The squad halts as...
          A SOUND fades in, a deep RUMBLING.
          The marines FALL BEHIND CARS now, pulling the civilians down
          with them as the RUMBLING continues to BUILD.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Under the cars! Now!
          The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE
          CARS with the civilians, pulling the kids under as...

          A GIANT HOST OF ALIENS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          Rounds the corner in the distance, THOUSANDS'OF THEM, filling
          the street from sidewalk to sidewalk. An army on the move.
          NANTZ DRAGS HECTOR UNDER ONE CAR with him,' pulls the boy in
          close, gets his legs under the car, under cover, just as...
          The mass of aliens SWARM PAST, the ground shaking, RUMBLING.
          The humans HUDDLE UNDER THE CARS, peering out to see the legs
          and arms of the aliens flying by. Some bound OVER THE CARS,
          which bounce up and down, BANGING with the aliens' weight.
          The RUMBLING EBBS as the aliens disappear into the distance.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          The squad moves in formation, surrounding the civilians.
          Little Kirsten comes up behind Correggio. He's surprised as
          she slips her hand into his. Correggio looks down, seeing
          how scared she is. He smiles, grips her hand tightly.
          Up ahead, Nantz leads, MAP in hand.

          PVT. IMLAY
          How far, sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          One block over.
          Imlay smiles at Kerns.

          PVT. IMLAY
          We'.re gonna make it! Dude, we're
          gonna make it...
          But as they approach a CORNER... Nantz stops, exchanges a
          glance with his corporals.

                         MICHELE
          What's the matter?

          SGT. NANTZ
          The smell.
          An ominous beat. The squad moves down the dark street as...
          ASH FLOATS DOWN here from the sky... Like a beautiful early
          winter snow...

          THEN THEY TURN THE CORNER

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          We slowly MOVE IN TIGHTER and TIGHTER on Nantz.
          Until we are CLOSE ON NANTZ' FACE.
          A REDDISH GLOW is reflected there. Nantz stops, looking
          horrified. We REVERSE to see...
          A DEEP BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the night sky from
          NUMEROUS FIRES that rage within the fence line of...

          SANTA MONICA AIRPORT.
          As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation
          is slowly revealed:
          CRASHED F-18 JETS and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways.
          BODIES and SMOLDERING MARINE VEHICLES litter the airfield.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Jesus... They wiped our Forward
          Operating Base right off the map.

          PVT. KERNS
          Now we know why those bombs never
          dropped. They took our jets out.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          This was a dug-in marine Corps
          position that had armor, air and
          ground. Maybe we got nothing left
          to fight with...
          Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us everything--

          THEY'RE LOSING THIS WAR.
          Nantz turns, spies an AIRPORT FIRE STATION by the runways.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's get under cover. Now.

          INT. DESERTED FIRE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

          The marines enter cautiously, rifles up. Then they hustle
          the civilians inside when it appears safe.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Lock this place down.
          The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as...
          Nantz kneels by Hector, tries to comfort him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          SGT. NANTZ
          You're a brave kid. When this is
          over, you're going to be a hero.

                         HECTOR
          People always say that. "He's a
          hero."

                         (BEAT)
          No one even knows what a hero is.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Your dad was a hero.
          Hector just stares back.

          SGT. NANTZ
          He saved Pvt. Adukwu up on that
          freeway.
          Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu. Something passes
          between them... One man died so another could live...

          SGT. NANTZ
          You save a marine under fire, you
          get a medal, y'know.
          Nantz pulls out a MEDALLION, the CREST of the 2/5 on it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          This is our medallion. It's yours.
          For your dad.

                         (SMILES)
          You're 2/5 now, Hector.
          Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks it over, pointing to
          the 2/5 MOTTO on it:

                         HECTOR
          What's that mean, "retreat hell?"

          SGT. NANTZ
          During World War I, an officer from
          our regiment was ordered to
          retreat. He said, "Retreat? Hell,
          we just got here!"
          Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now.
          Harris calls out:

          CPL. HARRIS
          We're secure, sergeant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          Nantz stands on this, addresses the marines:

          SGT. NANTZ
          Listen up. We need ammo. Kerns,
          Adukwu stay with the civilians.
          The rest of us, let's move.
          Nantz puts a hand on Hector's shoulder.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I'll be right back.

          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT RUNWAY - MINUTES LATER

          Black plumes of SMOKE fill the night sky as Nantz and his men
          head silently toward the bodies of dead marines and aliens.
          The tarmac is a smoldering WASTELAND: Empty, bombed-out
          buildings on its outskirts, burning aircraft and vehicles
          litter the runways. Fires crackle.
          As they go, the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of
          their fallen comrades, pulling out any available ammo.
          IMLAY whispers a low, heartfelt refrain to the dead marines
          he searches.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Sorry, bro.
          He moves on to another fallen marine, searching.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Sorry, bro.
          Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead
          marine. Then looking up, he sees...

          A LAV-25 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. INTACT.
          Nantz moves to it. Then turns. A LOW WHISTLE from him and
          the marines look up. They hustle to Nantz. Everyone gives
          the LAV an excited once-over.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Looks like it just rolled off the
          goddamn assembly line!

          PVT. IMLAY
          Good job, Sergeant!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TO STAVROU)
          Can you drive this thing?

          CPL. STAVROU
          Hell, if it's got an engine,
          sergeant, I can drive it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Good. Get it running.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Seems like vehicles are targets...

          SGT. NANTZ
          A minivan's a target, Correggio. A
          LAV with a Bushmaster chaingun...
          That's an asset.
          Imlay grins. Nantz motions to him, starting off.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Come on.

          PVT. IMLAY

                         (FOLLOWING)
          Me? Where, sergeant?
          Nantz points to the CONTROL TOWER, its windows blown out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          High ground. We need to see the
          big picture.

          INT. FIRE STATION - SAME

          Kerns has a tub of ice cream, scooping bowls for the kids.

          PVT. KERNS
          My dad's a fireman. They love
          their ice cream. Used to visit the
          firehouse with my little brother,
          they always had tons of it...
          (re. the kids)
          My brother's not much older than
          these guys.

                         MICHELE
          You don't look much older, either.
          She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         MICHELE
          Is this day ever going to end?

          PVT. KERNS
          Maybe the Sergeant'll find a way
          outta here.

                         MICHELE

                         (SMILES)
          What's with you guys anyway?
          Doesn't anybody have a first name?

                         ADUKWU
          Emmanuel. Manny.

          PVT. KERNS
          Pete. You married? Family?

                         MICHELE
          I'm single. Lots of family back in
          Nebraska, though... Hopefully
          they're safe...
          She shakes the thought away.

                         MICHELE
          What about you guys?

          PVT. KERNS
          Little Rock.

                         ADUKWU
          Nigeria. I came here to be a
          doctor.

                         MICHELE
          You should be a surgeon, the way
          you cut into that thing...
          Adukwu smiles. Then his smile fades as he looks around.

                         ADUKWU
          Yeah. Maybe...

          INT. CONTROL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

          Nantz enters with Imlay. They look around...
          The WINDOWS have been BLOWN OPEN. The wind rustles papers
          through the ghostly space, blowing them out into the night.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          On one desk, a COMPUTER is flashing a SLIDESHOW: Happy
          PICTURES of someone's family vacation.
          From this, high vantage point, they can see for miles...
          Nantz looks out one end of the control tower, sees all the
          way to the ocean...
          Then he turns, looks the other way, dead east...
          A vista of EXPLOSIONS, spreading-into the distance. ALIEN
          DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18s. One jet is blown up, spiralling
          to the ground.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Look how far east they've gotten.
          That's almost the whole city...
          Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS:
          Sees the HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills...
          Then pans to a mid-city area. Stops when he sees one
          quadrant of the city, blocks wide, SHIMMERING an INKY BLACK.
          Some kind of DARK ENERGY WAVE emanating from the ground.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What the hell's that?
          Imlay peers out.

          SGT. NANTZ
          There's zero activity there.
          And the area does seem completely devoid of activity-- No
          alien or human aircraft above it. Like a DEAD ZONE.

          PVT. IMLAY
          What are we gonna do, Sergeant?
          Nantz, panning with the binoculars, sees a CHOPPER TAKING OFF
          in the distance now.
          Nantz grabs a MAP on the desk, eyes roaming over it. Then
          looks back to where he saw the chopper.

          SGT. NANTZ
          That must be the alternate
          extraction site. Maybe we can
          evacuate the civilians there...
          He turns to Imlay.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get them in the LAV. I'll radio
          for an evac helicopter... When I
          do, they'll be coming, so we have
          to move fast.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Think we can make it, Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna give it one helluva
          try, Imlay.
          He reassures the young marine with each-word:

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're not dying here.

          INT. FIREHOUSE - LATER

          The marines, absent Nantz, surround the civilians
          protectively as they hustle them into the LAV.

          CONTROL TOWER - SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - MINUTES LATER
          Nantz standing alone with a RADIO PACK looking out into the
          black night, wind blowing through the tower.
          The LAV WAITS ON THE TARMAC below, engine running.
          Nantz takes a deep breath. Presses the button on the RADIO.

                         NANTZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          Any station, this is Foxtrot 2
          November. I have four civilians
          and seven marines, we're heading to
          Alternate Extraction Point Charlie.
          Requesting evacuation. I say
          again, this is Foxtrot 2 November
          heading to Alternate Extraction
          Point Charlie. Out.
          Nantz turns immediately, hurrying out.

          EXT. CONTROL TOWER - SECONDS LATER

          Nantz runs from the tower and climbs into the LAV.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz sees the civilians and marines crammed together in the
          back amid gear and guns.
          He turns to Stavrou behind the wheel.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Use the thermal sight. No lights.
          Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs...

          INTO THE TURRET
          He mans the M-240 MACHINE GUN. Imlay beside him on the 25MM

          BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.
          Headlights off, running dark, Stavrou drives, peering through
          the THERMAL SIGHT.

          STAVROU'S POV THROUGH THERMAL
          Washed green, the city a war zone, massive destruction..
          An ALIEN DRONE winging toward the airport as...

          EXT. STREET, NEAR SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

          The LAV moves fast in total darkness down a car-strewn
          street. Santa Monica Airport fading behind them, suddenly...
          BOOOOOOM-! Bright burst of light!
          And the Control Tower explodes in a ball of fire.

          INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz watches the alien drone fly off into the night.

          EXT. STREET - LATER - NIGHT

          Miles away, the LAV drives through a CITY STREET, surrounded
          by TALL BUILDINGS, the area a desolate wasteland now.

          INT. LAV - SAME

          Stavrou drives, hands gripping the wheel as he maneuvers
          carefully through wrecked abandoned cars.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          IN THE TURRET
          Nantz eyes a nervous Imlay.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Extract site's only a couple more
          miles, Imlay.
          Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to...

          STAVROU, BEHIND THE WHEEL...
          Eyes focusing tensely through the thermal sight scope.

          THERMAL SIGHT POV
          Green wash of the city passing by. Tall, empty buildings all
          around... Suddenly, a big DARK OBJECT in the street!
          Stavrou SLAMS THE BRAKES. Civilians and marines in the tight
          passenger compartment are thrown around.
          Right in front of the LAV...
          A massive CRATER. The street's impassable.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We gotta go around.
          The LAV backs up, Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the M-240
          machine gun, trying to see out into the darkness...
          Then they TURN A CORNER... And a VIEW BETWEEN TWO TALL
          BUILDINGS is harrowing...
          FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering... Then turning. Flying
          toward them.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Get ready, Imlay. Here they come.
          Stavrou looks out to see... A HELICOPTER in the distance.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Think I see our ride, sergeant!

                         SGT NANTZ
          Get us there. Cause we're about to
          get lit up.
          The alien drone ships are winging at them. They are only 200
          meters out when...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          SGT. NANTZ
          See what that Bushmaster can do,
          Imlay!
          Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Come on, you martian bastards!
          The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a
          minute, each capable of destroying a light tank.
          For once, the aliens are overmatched. The ALIEN SHIPS take
          HEAVY FIRE from the Bushmaster...
          One goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind
          buildings.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Where'd they go? Where'd they go?
          Nantz is scanning the sky, then...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Imlay, on your six!
          Imlay spins in the turret, picking up...
          The three remaining ALIEN AIRCRAFT coming back around.
          The lead alien ship FIRES!
          A ,CAR EXPLODES next to the LAV. Imlay rocks in the turret.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Son of a...
          Imlay targets, fires the Bushmaster...
          The lead alien ship is HIT, winging out of control INTO A
          SECOND SHIP. The TWO SHIPS EXPLODE into a building as...
          The FINAL ALIEN AIRCRAFT dodges the FIREBALL, flying straight
          at the LAV...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Getting close, Imlay...

          PVT. IMLAY
          I got it.
          Imlay FIRES a burst. The last aircraft is hit...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          It PINWHEELS TO THE GROUND, exploding into FLAMING WRECKAGE
          which hurtles RIGHT AT THE LAV.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stand on it, Stavrou!
          Stavrou pushes it, TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage...
          Which is almost on top of the LAV as...
          Stavrou spins AROUND A CORNER, escaping.
          The wreckage explodes into a building behind them as...
          THUMP - THUMP - THUMP! The sound of a UH-1'Medevac ECHOES.

          PVT. IMLAY
          The chopper!
          Nantz looks out, sees the CHOPPER LANDING in the street.
          The LAV screeches up amid the RUBBLE and SMOKE.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Last stop!

          SGT. NANTZ
          Everybody out!
          The marines rush the civilians OUT OF THE LAV... Nantz and
          Imlay scrambling out last.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Pretty decent shooting, Imlay.

          PVT. IMLAY

                         (GRINNING)
          Goddamn, you did it, sergeant!
          We're gonna get these people out!

          EVERYONE RUNS TO THE CHOPPER.
          The marines begin loading the civilians in, the old-school
          CREW CHIEF hopping off to help the kids in.

                         CREW CHIEF
          You are in the middle of the shit,
          Sergeant! Everything's been pulled
          back.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What are you talking about?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         CREW CHIEF
          We've lost most of our air assets.
          We're abandoning Los Angeles. This
          city's done...!
          (to the pilot)
          Let's go!
          The chopper powers up, Nantz SCRAMBLES ON with the others.

          INT. EVAC HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

          The CHOPPER BEGINS TO LIFT OFF. As it rises, Nantz gazes out
          at the CITYSCAPE. He sees fires, wreckage everywhere. Then
          he looks off to see...

          THE BLACK DEAD ZONE SHIMMERING NEARBY
          Nantz watches the HELICOPTER BANK TOWARD THE BLACK ZONE. But
          as it gets closer...
          The HELICOPTER DIPS precipitously, suddenly losing altitude.
          The kids SCREAM. The marines hang on.
          Nantz sees the PILOT STRUGGLING with the controls. The
          HELICOPTER'S GAUGES are going crazy.
          The pilot BANKS HARD AWAY from the area, reversing course.
          And the helicopter STABILIZES.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What the hell happened?!

                         CREW CHIEF
          Something there was playing hell
          with our power!
          Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him.
          He sees the 2/5 MEDALLION clutched tightly in Hector's hand.
          Sees the words "Retreat Hell."
          Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of cityscape.
          Then he turns to the crew chief.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Set us back down!

                         CREW CHIEF
          What?!
          The other marines in Nantz' unit look over, alarmed now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We need to recon that area!

                         CREW CHIEF
          We can't land! May not have power
          to take off again...
          Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF. He
          points to it.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Then we'll rope down!

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          What the hell, sergeant? What's
          going on?

          SGT. NANTZ
          There's something over there... We
          could be the only ones left here to
          figure out what it is.
          (to the others)
          Let's go, marines.
          The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull
          themselves up. ROPES are dropped from the chopper as it
          hovers over the building...

          SGT. NANTZ
          NOW! Go! Go!
          The marines start to RAPPEL DOWN, one after another as...
          Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele.

          SGT. NANTZ
          They'll get you safe.
          He smiles at the girls. Then turns, nods at Hector. Puts a
          hand on his shoulder. A BEAT.

          SGT. NANTZ
          See you soon, buddy.

                         HECTOR
          What are you gonna do?

          SGT. NANTZ
          We're gonna fight.
          Nantz turns, grabs a ROPE, drops out of the chopper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

          As the chopper hovers, Nantz drops to the roof, hunkers down
          with the other marines. Nantz watches the evac helicopter
          fly off to safety.
          Then he turns to the marines, who stare back hopelessly,
          clearly at their lowest point.

          PVT. KERNS
          Why'd we get off the chopper,
          Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          'Cause we have a job to do.

          PVT. IMLAY
          But we were getting out...!

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You have some hunch and now we're
          stuck out here in the shit?!

          SGT. NANTZ
          That's right. This fight's not
          over.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Sergeant's gonna get us killed!
          Just like my brother.
          A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Believe me, Correggio, I grieved
          for every marine I ever lost...
          Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine.

          SGT. NANTZ
          But we are in the fight of our
          lives right now. And our duty is
          to keep moving forward. Keep
          fighting. That's how we honor men
          like your brother, Correggio. And
          Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father,
          who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't
          trained for that. He just picked
          up a rifle and did what needed to
          be done. If a civilian can do
          that...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          SGT. NANTZ (cont'd)
          Well then I better square my shit
          away and do whatever I have to do
          to defeat this enemy. But I can't
          do it alone.
          Nantz stares. The tension is palpable.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I need you men. And maybe we'll
          die fighting today. Not because
          we're heroes. But because we're
          goddamn United States marines, and
          always will be.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm willing to give my full measure
          for you. I'm hoping you'll do the
          same for me.
          A BEAT, glances exchanged. THEN ALL THE MARINES RISE AS ONE.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Sergeant. We'll follow you to hell
          and back.
          Nantz smiles, nods.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Good. 'Cause that's where we're
          going.

          EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          The squad is moving in unison, covering all around,
          approaching the LAV. They jump in.

          INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS

          Stavrou fires it up, drives off as... Nantz eyes the jumble
          of gear. He grabs his COMBAT SHOTGUN, a portable RADIO,
          which he makes sure is OFF...
          Then an olive case marked: GLTD. He stuffs it in his pack.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Laser target, sir?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Might have to get some cruise
          missiles in here.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Shit, yes, Sergeant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          CPL. STAVROU

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Hostiles. Twelve o'clock.
          Nantz looks up to see...
          ALIEN SOLDIERS appearing on the street now.
          Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got
          plenty of armor.
          Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see...
          The aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as...
          Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE pinging off the LAV's armor
          as... SPLAT!!!

          STAVROU MOWS THROUGH THE ENEMY LINE.
          Nantz looks out the back to see some ALIENS STAGGERING AWAY.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Reverse, Corporal.

          CPL. STAVROU
          Aye, aye, Sergeant.
          As he BACKS UP, mowing back over the remaining aliens... The
          marines cheer.

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          The LAV cruises slowly. Nantz stares forward.
          The BLACK DEAD ZONE looms ahead... As they get closer, it
          seems like the whole area is absent of light. A black hole.
          Nantz stares out, about to answer when the LAV LURCHES, then
          lurches again. Stavrou REVS the engine.

          SGT. NANTZ
          What's going on?

          CPL. STAVROU
          Losing power, Sergeant. Gauges are
          dropping... losing voltage...
          The LAV slows. The engine skips. Then the LAV DIES.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Stavrou?

          CPL. STAVROU
          She's dead, Sergeant.
          Nantz looks around, warily. The streets are quiet, deserted.

          SGT. NANTZ
          All right, dismount. Grab anything
          you think we can use.
          The men nod, and move OUT OF THE LAV to...

          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Correggio and Kerns on one side of the street, Stavrou and
          Harris on the other. Imlay with Adukwu. Nantz watches his
          men move forward, covering each other's advance. Scanning'
          the buildings, searching for targets...
          Then Nantz halts them. They crouch together, peering at...
          The middle of the DEAD ZONE just ahead of them. It is very
          dark. No lights are visible from any source. The men SWEAT.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Hot as hell here.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          No lights.

          PVT. ADUKWU
          My watch stopped.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Something's generating heat.
          Messing with our electronics.
          Sucking up all the power...
          Nantz scans the street. The sweat dripping into his eyes.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Where would you put a critical
          asset if you wanted to protect it?
          Or hide it?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Underground.
          Nantz points to A SUBWAY ENTRANCE AHEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

          INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

          The squad runs to the subway entrance, stopping just inside.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch
          the street.
          Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance.
          Nantz motions to the others.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's go.
          Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the
          stopped escalator to the SUBWAY PLATFORM.
          Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform.
          Silent. Spooky. A train is stopped. Doors open. It is
          dark, the only light bleeding in from the street above.
          He motions Stavrou to guard against anything coming from
          above. Then he moves forward with the others.
          A huge number of BIRDS line the dark cavity above the train
          tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly.
          Nantz sees a DOOR in the tunnel wall, heads to it.
          He pulls his KA-BAR KNIFE out, sticks the blade into the door
          jam, pops the DOOR OPEN. Nantz turns to Correggio and Kerns.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (QUIETLY)
          You two stay here, watch our backs.

                         (TO IMLAY)
          Imlay, come with me.
          Nantz and Imlay slip through the doorway.

          INT. UNDERGROUND SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz and Imlay stand very still, peering down the long, dark
          hall, looking for movement. Nantz motions and they move
          forward silently, guns ready.
          They turn a corner and stop. It is PITCH BLACK here.
          Nantz clicks on his flashlight. They move forward. After
          only a few feet, the FLASHLIGHT DIMS AND DIES.
          Imlay clicks on his flashlight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (WHISPERING)
          No. Save it. Something is killing
          anything electronic we use.
          Imlay clicks his flashlight OFF. But now we see...
          A dim light ahead. Nantz and Imlay creep forward, very
          slowly. Turn a corner, see...
          A STRANGE LIGHT at the end of the hallway. THE LIGHT GLOWS
          fiercely, as if it's shining through the floor.
          Nantz, silhouetted by the light, signals Imlay to stay put.
          Nantz steps forward, toward the strange glow of light. As he
          approaches, he realizes it's coming through...
          An IRON GRATE in the floor.
          Nantz moves to the grate, kneels, PEERING DOWN INTO...

          A MASSIVE SUBWAY TUNNEL
          Fifty feet wide, the dim tunnel has been further EXCAVATED.
          It is a huge CAVERN now, extending off into the distance
          further than Nantz can see.
          The huge space is illuminated by MASSES OF ALIEN MACHINERY.
          An ELECTRIC HUM FILLS THE AIR.
          Tending the machinery: DOZENS OF ALIENS, bigger than the
          others.
          One of the ALIENS TURNS, focusing up, right at Nantz.
          Nantz spins, runs back into the darkness. Calling to Imlay:

          SGT. NANTZ
          Run, Imlay! Run!
          BANG. The iron GRATE FLIES into the air.

          INT. DIFFERENT PART OF UNDERGROUND SERVICE TUNNEL

          Nantz and Imlay, race along in the dark. They hear POUNDING
          FOOTSTEPS of the alien pursuing him.
          A glimmer of LIGHT ahead. Along the floor. It is, a DOOR.
          They burst through a DOOR, into...

          A DIM STAIRWELL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          Nantz follows Imlay UP THE STAIRS as...
          The STAIRWELL DOOR below is SMASHED OPEN.
          Nantz spins, swinging his shotgun. HE FIRES.
          BOOM! The blast ILLUMINATES the huge ALIEN, filling the
          stairwell with its horrible bulk.
          Nantz backs up the stairs, pumping the shotgun, firing...
          Each blast ILLUMINATES THE ALIEN in a STROBE EFFECT. The
          alien moves up the stares. Nantz KEEPS FIRING.
          The NOISE IS DEAFENING in the enclosed space.
          Then the SHOTGUN RUNS DRY. And we're left IN DARKNESS.
          Imlay clicks on his FLASHLIGHT, revealing...
          The ALIEN at Nantz' feet, its strange "hand" on his boot.
          Nantz, terrified, aims at the alien, waiting to see if it
          will move. It doesn't.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER

          Nantz and Imlay re-enter, running up to join the others.
          Up the stairs, by street-level, Harris and Adukwu keep watch.
          Harris motions: "ENEMY TROOPS".
          Nantz nods. Signals for all the marines to head down the
          stairs. The marines gather around Nantz. To Harris:

          SGT. NANTZ
          How many?

          CPL. HARRIS
          Hard to tell. A lot.

          SGT. NANTZ
          I think I got their attention.
          Nantz kneels. He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the
          case marked GLTD.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Look. There's something big down
          in the tunnels. It's sucking up a
          lot of power, could be a major
          Command &.Control asset.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Nantz stares at his men.

          SGT. NANTZ
          We need to destroy it.

          PVT. KERNS
          But we got no jets left, right,
          Sergeant?

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hopefully, they can still fire
          cruise missiles from Pendleton or
          Vandenburg... I'll radio in a
          strike, paint the target from the
          street. You know what that means.
          The man nod solemnly.

          PVT. IMLAY
          We gotta hold 'em off long enough
          to paint the target.

          CPL. STAVROU
          If we can get a transmission out
          before the radio dies...

          CPL. HARRIS
          And the targeting laser lasts long
          enough for command to get a lock on
          the target.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Hell, dying's easy, ladies.
          Everything else takes balls, right?
          They all laugh softly.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Let's do it.
          He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and TRANSMITS:

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TRANSMITTING)
          Any station, this is Foxtrot 2
          November. Priority Fire Mission. I
          have identified a major enemy
          command and control asset-- located
          grid 459083. 1 WILL BE LASING.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          COMMAND (V.0.)
          Foxtrot 2. You have visual
          confirmation of this C&C asset? We
          can't waste resources.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Affirmative. They're building a
          huge complex underground... I think
          it's the head of the snake.
          Repeat. I will be...

          THE RADIO GOES DEAD.
          Alien fire EXPLODES now, rocking the station.
          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Nantz and the marines cover their heads
          as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall.
          The walls crack. Dust fills the air.
          Nantz SCREAMS as a chunk of concrete FALLS ACROSS HIS ANKLE.
          Then, it's over. All is silent. Nantz, GRIMACING in PAIN,
          strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle. He GROANS.
          The marines rise. Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet.
          He slings his rifle, and carrying the GLTD, hurries on his
          bad ankle to the stairs.
          Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is
          only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling.
          The men all unclip their web gear, begin climbing.

          EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          A chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance,
          and Nantz emerges, rolling down the pile to the street.
          The other marines follow, set up a perimeter as..,.
          Nantz takes cover behind a berm of rubble, DROPPING down,
          flattening himself to the ground.
          He sets the GLTD (LASER DESIGNATOR) up on top of the pile.
          Nantz removes his flack jacket and places it over the laser
          designator.

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Here we go...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          Nantz switches on the TARGETING LASER.
          A RED BEAM OF LIGHT shoots from the designator to a fixed
          point in the center of the street.
          Nantz looks up to see...
          The street fill with ALIEN SOLDIERS rushing out now.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Here they come!
          The marines FORM A PERIMETER AROUND THE LASER, OPENING UP on
          the aliens as...
          The mass of aliens surges forward like a wave.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Hold them back! We have to keep
          the laser on target!
          Nantz FIRES. An alien goes down. He picks another target
          and FIRES. The alien staggers, keeps coming. Three more
          rounds and the alien goes down.
          But the rest KEEP COMING... closing in...

          FOLLOWING THE BEAM OF THE LASER BACK TO NANTZ.
          Nantz is picking his targets. AIMING, FIRING... Turning,
          finding targets, reloading, the aliens getting closer...
          Then his rifle runs dry.
          NANTZ pulls his sidearm. He aim, FIRES, shooting a closing
          alien in its 'heart.' It drops.
          Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another alien...
          Then the next. The next. Then his sidearm is out of bullets
          as... An EXPLOSION rips near Nantz.
          Knocking the laser away.
          Nantz struggles...TO THE LASER. RE-AIMING it as...

          MORE ALIENS POUR INTO THE STREET.
          The marines are pushed into a SMALL CIRCLE around the laser.
          Fighting nearly back to back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          Kerns is HIT. He is thrown to the ground, but is back up,
          arm bleeding, firing.
          An alien RUSHES AT CORREGGIO who spins just in time, FIRING
          repeatedly until the alien goes down.
          Stavrou swings his rifle butt, SMASHING another alien. It
          staggers back. Stavrou puts numerous rounds into it.
          An alien reaches ADUKWU, knocking him to the ground, about to
          blast him...
          Harris runs the alien through with his bayonet, twisting and
          firing his rifle at the same time. The alien falls.
          The marines are FIGHTING AS ONE.
          All focused on SURROUNDING NANTZ. THEN THE LASER DIES.
          Imlay notices the laser beam is gone.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Did we get a lock!?

          SGT. NANTZ
          I don't know!
          Then... An ear-splitting NOISE. The marines look up, see...

          A CRUISE MISSILE COMING STRAIGHT DOWN THE STREET!
          Nantz looks up at his men, yelling:

          SGT. NANTZ
          INCOMING! Fall back! This way!
          Nantz and his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do,
          trying to hold off the aliens.
          Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is
          there to help him up.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Think you just twisted your ankle,.
          sir.
          And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this.

          SGT. NANTZ
          Don't stop!! We're too close to
          the impact point!!
          The marines start running as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          MORE CRUISE MISSILES APPEAR, RIPPING TOWARD THE GROUND...
          BOOOOOM! The first missile strikes!
          Then another...and another ...BOOOOM! BOOOOM!
          A piercing WHISTLE sounds. Nantz looks into the sky as...
          Suddenly KABOOOM!!! A 2000 pound laser-guided ARTILLERY
          SHELL explodes INTO THE GROUND...
          THE GROUND HEAVES UP. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION of fire and smoke
          erupting from beneath the surface.

          A SHOCK WAVE BURSTS OUT FROM THE IMPACT POINT.

          THE MARINES ARE ENVELOPED... DISAPPEARING as...
          Buildings shatter, cars are tossed, flames erupt.
          Then SILENCE descends a moment. Only the crackle of flames,
          falling glass. The dust and ash settles in a grey haze.
          Nothing could have survived this. BEAT. Then...
          A FIGURE RISES UP out of the grey destruction.

          SGT. NANTZ

          MARINES!
          AS ONE, the men rise out of the ash, standing tall.

          SGT. NANTZ

          ON ME!
          The marines fall in. A PHALANX with Nantz at its center.

          SGT. NANTZ

          FIRE!
          They move forward. Precise. Deadly. FIGHTING AS ONE.
          The seven remaining marines POUR FIRE on the mass of aliens.
          The Drone Ships fall from the sky, EXPLODING on the ground.
          The aliens, in disarray, are mowed down. The rest FLEE.
          And as the smoke drifts away, there is silence again.
          Nantz looks up to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          HIS MEN. His warriors. Standing with smoking weapons, ready
          for more. Correggio staggers up, covered in dust, bloody.

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          You know what, Sergeant? My
          brother said you were a bad ass.

                         (SMILES)
          I had no idea...

          SGT. NANTZ
          Your brother was one helluva
          marine, Correggio.

                         (SMILES BACK)
          So are you.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MEDEVAC HELICOPTER

          Nantz sits in the rumbling chopper. Surrounded by his
          marines. Imlay stares out at the city below.

          PVT. IMLAY
          Man, it's quiet.

          CHOPPER PILOT (V.0.)
          They're in full retreat throughout
          Los Angeles, heading back into the
          ocean. Units are mopping up.
          On this, Nantz turns to his SQUAD. Beat.

          SGT. NANTZ
          This has been a hell of a battle.
          Plenty of other battles to go.
          Everybody good with that?
          The marines don't hesitate.

                         MARINES
          Yes, Sergeant!

          CPL. CORREGGIO
          Well, uh, actually, Sergeant...
          there's this girl I was supposed to
          meet up with tonight...

          SGT. NANTZ

                         (SMILES)
          I'm sure she'll understand.
          Nantz looks at his marines.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

                         NANTZ
          I think you men earned the right to
          call yourselves marines today. I'm
          damn proud of every one of you.
          Retreat!?

                         MARINES

          HELL!

                         ALL

          2/5!!!

	Darkness, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. Presentation credits roll as we
	FADE UP ON:

	INT. HOSPITAL, INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT

	It's 1967, the Summer of Love and --

	BOOM! Entry doors swing open as PARAMEDICS wheel in a FEMALE BLEEDER,
	VANESSA (20s, black, nine months pregnant). She's deathly pale,
	spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat -- 

	A SHOCK-TRAUMA TEAM swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an
	artery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her
	arm --

				NURSE #1
			(with stethoscope)
		She's not breathing!

				SENIOR RESIDENT
		Intubate her!

	The RESPIRATORY THERAPIST feeds an endotracheal tube down the woman's
	ruined throat, attaches that to an Amblu bag --

				RESIDENT
		Blood-pressure's forty and falling --

	The woman starts spasming violently. It takes three staff members
	just to hold her down.

				SENIOR RESIDENT
		Jesus, her water's broken --
			(calling for help)
		She's going into uterine contractions --

	CAMERA PUSHES IN on the woman as she bolts upright, SCREAMING to wake
	the dead. We PLUNGE INTO the darkness of her mouth and find
	ourselves --

	INSIDE HER BLOODSTREAM

	The sound of a HEART BEATING, pounding as we whip-snake through --

	CORPUSCLES 

	floating in amber plasma. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and
	eosinophils. 

	The rhythmic expansion of the artery walls, pulsing with each
	successive surge of blood as the HEART BEATS FASTER AND FASTER,
	taking us --

	IN UTERO,

	A CHILD, alive but unborn, shifting in a sea of amniotic fluid,
	surrounded by the white, protective substance known as vernix
	caseosa. The HEARTBEAT races like a locomotive now. The unborn child
	shifts, turns its head towards us --

	-- and opens its eyes.

	CUT TO:

	A SWORDBLADE

	cleaving the darkness, radiant light slicing across gleaming Damascus
	steel. Words acid-etched in the weapon's fine-tempered surface:

	BLADE

	Main credits end.

	EXT. INNER CITY, INDUSTRIAL GHETTO - NIGHT

	A decaying no man's land populated by condemned buildings and HUNGRY
	HOMELESS. Steam rises from manhole covers, drifting across the
	litter- lined streets. Suddenly --

	A black Mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill, ROARING past
	us, stereo system belting out FILTER.

	INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Raquel, a wasp-wasted woman, sits behind the wheel. 20s, rich,
	sickeningly attractive. Hungry eyes. 

	Squirming around in the passenger seat is DENNIS, a model/actor boy-
	toy with a sub-zero IQ and a "fuck me sideways" grin. 

				DENNIS
		So where we going?

				RAQUEL
		It's a surprise. 

				DENNIS
		I likes surprises. 

	Raquel eyeballs Dennis -- "if looks could devour". 

				RAQUEL
		What do you have down there, little 
		man?

				DENNIS
		Heat-seeker.

				RAQUEL
		I'll bet.

	Raquel slides a manicured hand up his thigh, squeezes his groin.
	Dennis MOANS. She pulls her hand away, downshifts.

	EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT

	The 850 threads a narrow alley into a vacant lot, BRAKES hard. Raquel
	and Dennis climb out. She leads him into --

	EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

	Industry never sleeps, and certainly not this grisly facility. Raquel
	leads Dennis around the back of the plant, where a host of WORKERS
	are loading refrigerated trucks with product.

				DENNIS
		What the fuck are we doing here?

	Raquel just smiles, heads on into the plant via a loading door. The
	workers ignore her.

	INT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

	Dennis follows Raquel through the bowels of the plant, catching
	glimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart. 

	Through one partially open door we see what might be a line of
	BODYBAGS being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain
	pulley-system. But Dennis doesn't have enough time to be disturbed by
	the vision, because he's being pulled away by Raquel, led down --

	A STAIRWELL

	We are in the basement now. At the end of the hall is a steel door,
	with perhaps, just the faintest HINT OF MUSIC heard coming from
	beyond. Raquel knocks.

	A "peep-hole" slat opens and a BLACK LIGHT shines into Raquel's eyes.
	A VOICE behind the door offers a verbal challenge, speaking a
	language we've never heard, laced with a devilish cadence. 

	Raquel responds in kind. The door opens. Raquel gives Dennis a
	knowing wink, enters. Dennis follows. 

	INT. CLUB - NIGHT

	Raquel and Dennis move past a hulking DOORMAN, making their way down
	a narrow stairway. Dennis is suitably impressed.

	THE CLUB 

	is elite, underground -- an "abattoir-chic" version of an old-time
	juke joint with a greasy, dangerous vibe. White-tiled walls and
	floors for easy hosing, chromed fittings, run-off gutters, drains. No
	bar.

	BODIES 

	writhe on the strobe-lit dance floor. A heavy S&M scene. Leather.
	Latex. Tattoos. Body-piercings.

	A D.J. wearing head-mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on
	twin- decks. MUSIC assaults us -- a beat so heavy it could jar the
	fillings from your teeth. Brutal "DARKCORE" along the lines of
	Prodigy or Underground. 

	Raquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway. 

	A lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running
	through her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against
	him. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCURY.

	Mercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced
	with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across
	her back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex. 

	Dennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of
	them dry-humping their way to every man's glory. 

	The beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more
	narcotic. People are stripping off their clothes, sweating like
	fiends. It's a virtual orgy.

	Dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever
	pitch --

				DENNIS
			(over the music)
		Fuck, I need a drink!!!

	Raquel just smiles -- then Dennis notices a DROP OF SOMETHING spatter
	his hand. It looks like blood. Dennis looks up, concerned --

	-- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling. Raquel's face is sprinkled with
	them now. Dennis stops dancing. What is this? Some kind of fucked up
	performance art?

	Raquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a
	summer shower, now the other club goers are looking up too --

	BLOOD SHOWERS DOWN

	from sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. The club
	goers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to
	receive the crimson offering. 

	Horrified, Dennis recoils, turning towards --

	RAQUEL,

	whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl. Her canines extend,
	tapering to razor-sharp points. Her tongue flicks, lizard-like as
	fingernails sharpen into claws. All this while the whites of her eyes
	BLEED RED, pupils oscillating hypnotically. 

				RAQUEL
		What's wrong, baby?

	Dennis SCREAMS, pushes away from Raquel, only --

	-- Mercury has fangs now too. In fact, everyone in the club does,
	with the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're all
	vampires.

	Dennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally
	smashing his fist into Dennis' face. 

	Dennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a
	game of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces
	leering like twisted jack-o-lanterns.

	The strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis
	spins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis
	lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up.
	A DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The
	figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- 

	A BLACK MAN, 

	towers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a
	sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of
	horror. His name is BLADE.

	Blade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an
	arsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body: 

	6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with
	an ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a "Demon"
	automatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style
	katar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his
	namesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard.

	CLOSE ON BLADE

	A gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers
	stare back. Nuclear silence. And then --

	All hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving
	at superhuman speed, practically a blur -- 

	Blade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions --

	MACRO BULLET SHOT 

	as a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum-
	dum bullet which explodes on contact.

	WHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest,
	continuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both
	creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of
	black oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains.

	Blade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He
	holsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on
	the UV entry light mounted above --

	MERCURY 

	leaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything
	move so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into
	the night just as --

	-- a shaft of blinding UV "sunlight" cuts across the vampires. They
	rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade
	opens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets
	into the crowd -- vampire genocide.

	The strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires
	try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes
	clogged with liquefying bodies -- 

	-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their
	opening, surge forward en masse -- 

	Blade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!-
	unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. 

	THE SWORD

	Four acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so
	sharp it could cleave a shadow in two.

	Blade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING
	VAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half --

	ON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB,

	a LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword,
	sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the
	vampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies.

	Beat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses --

	SOMETHING BIG

	rising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward,
	cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb
	falls to the floor -- 

	-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into
	Blade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables,
	slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the
	ceiling. 

	Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot-
	something nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head,
	jaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual
	scarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos. 

	Blade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at
	bay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a
	stake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx.
	Quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. 

	Blade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his
	leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open,
	drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES -- 

	The bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and
	nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to
	pull out the stake --

	Blade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm,
	effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board.

	UP ABOVE, 

	mounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a
	cross-bow bolt straight into the lens. 

	Blade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest.

				BLADE
		Where is Deacon Frost?

	Quinn glares, trying to speak, gagging on the stake still lodged in
	his trachea --

				BLADE
		Got something in your throat.

	Blade yanks the stake free. The vampire laughs, air whistling through
	his ruined larynx. 

				QUINN
		Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying 
		shit --

				BLADE
		Frost.

	Quinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade
	sees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips
	a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness -- 

				QUINN
		You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's 
		rising, the Sleeper's gonna --

	Blade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH!
	Quinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work,
	ignoring the howling pyre behind him:

	All evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few
	oily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by
	the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition.

	DENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade
	approaches, he cringes back --

				DENNIS
		Please don't --

	Blade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward,
	rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't
	any.

	Blade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade
	starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step --

	A COCKROACH

	scurries out from underfoot. 

	Blade adjusts his footfall, sparing the roach. He continues on up the
	stairs, disappearing in the smoky haze. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. CITY HOSPITAL, AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

	CAMERA FOLLOWS a bagged corpse as it's rolled into the autopsy room
	by an ASSISTANT. 

				ASSISTANT
		Brought you a baked potato, nice
		and crispy. Still warm, too.

	CURTIS WEBB, the forensic pathologist (30s, white bread, a little on
	the smarmy side) steps forward, unzips the bag --

	It's Quinn, what's left of him, anyway. Burnt to a charcoal
	briquette, limbs twisted horribly, oozing fluids.

	Curtis turns his head, grimacing, wafting the air.

				CURTIS
		Jesus, that's rank -- 

	Curtis turns back, makes note of the blackened stump where Quinn's
	arm used to be, the ruined throat -- 

				CURTIS
		What's his story?

				ASSISTANT
		Paramedics said he was still screaming 
		when they found him. Looks like some 
		joker had stapled him to a wall.

				CURTIS
		Pretty.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL, HEMATOLOGY LAB - NIGHT

	MICROSCOPE POV

	of a slide-mounted blood smear stained with Wright stain (blue ink).
	What we see is a collection of donut-shaped pink things (red blood
	cells) intermingled with some small blue specks (platelets) and the
	occasional larger, light-blue blobs (white blood cells).

	KAREN JANSEN (20s), a fine-featured hematologist with a social life
	in suspended animation, sits back from the microscope, stumped. Next
	to her is JULIE WHITAKER, a cheerful chemtech. 

				KAREN
		You took this off a DOA?

	Curtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding.

				KAREN
		This isn't human blood.

				CURTIS
		Then what is it?

				KAREN
		I don't know --
			(re: microscope)
		Look at this blood smear -- 

	Curtis takes a look for himself.

				KAREN
		The red blood cells are biconvex, 
		which is theoretically impossible. 
		They're hypochromic, there's virtually 
		no hemoglobin in them. 
			(shaking her head)
		Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, 
		they should be mononucleated.

				CURTIS
		What about the chemistry panel? 

	Karen looks to Julie, who reaches for a computer print-out.

				JULIE
		Blood sugar level is three times the 
		norm, phosphorous and uric acid are 
		off the scales.
			(shrugs)
		Like the woman said, impossible.

	Karen removes her glasses, rubbing the bridge of her nose.

				KAREN
		Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm 
		really not in the mood for one of your 
		practical jokes.

				CURTIS
			(insistent)
		It's not a joke. I've got the stiff 
		sitting in the morgue right now -- 
		look, just come up and see him, okay? 
		Five minutes, that's all I ask.

				KAREN
		I thought you promised to give me some 
		distance?

				CURTIS
		This is purely professional curiosity, 
		Karen, I swear.

	Karen rolls her eyes, lets loose a tired sigh.

				KAREN
		Five minutes, not a second more. And I 
		don't want to hear a word about "us".

				CURTIS
		No problem.

	INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - NIGHT

	The dead of night, not a mouse in the house. Curtis and Karen, each
	garbed in a mask, stand on either side of Quinn's body, which now
	rests on the autopsy table.

	QUINN'S BODY

	A preliminary exploratory Y-incision has been made across the chest,
	stretching from shoulder to shoulder, then continuing on down the
	abdomen. Ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart
	and lungs.

				KAREN
		You haven't started in on the internal 
		organs?

				CURTIS 
		Just the blood sample from the 
		pericardial sac.

	Curtis pauses, studying Quinn's disfigured face -- the features seem
	much less damaged now -- almost as if the corpse were healing itself.

				CURTIS
		That's weird --

				KAREN
		What?

				CURTIS
		He looks different now, burns are less 
		extreme, some of these wounds have 
		closed up -- 

	Curtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. He leans over Quinn,
	shining the light into one of his eyes.

				CURTIS
		Tell me something, honestly, you ever 
		have second thoughts about us?

				KAREN
			(grudgingly)
		Sometimes --

	Curtis looks up from the corpse, grinning beneath his mask.

				KAREN
		-- but then I remember what an 
		ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back 
		to reality. 

				CURTIS
		Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart 
		here --

	Quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs
	into Curtis' jugular. He snaps the man's neck in two for easier
	access, sucking in blood like a living vacuum. 

	Karen stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools CLATTERING.

	QUINN

	rises from the table, flinging Curtis' twitching body aside. He curls
	his blood-soaked lips back, baring viper-like fangs, emitting a
	GUTTURAL GROWL --

				QUINN
			(crazed by thirst)
		-- more -- blood --

	Karen backs into the corpse drawers, but Quinn is upon her in a half-
	second, wrapping a hand about her throat. His mouth opens/morphs
	disturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole, caustic saliva
	dripping from his canines -- 

	Karen tries to turn her head away, but Quinn's grip is vise-like. She
	finds herself staring into his eyes -- pupils pulsing rapid-fire,
	opening and closing, hypnotic --

	As Quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into Karen's carotid artery and
	starts to nurse --

	BANG!!! A load of MAHOGANY buckshot chews into Quinn's side. He HOWLS
	in pain. Another load catches him full in the face. He drops Karen.
	She falls to the floor -- 

	KAREN'S POV

	The sound of RUSHING BLOOD pounding through her skull. Everything
	spinning. She struggles to move, turns her head, finds herself eye to
	eye with Curtis' corpse.

	ON QUINN

	rising, his face torn up, smoking. WHIP PAN TO --

	BLADE, 

	standing at the entrance to the morgue, a streetsweeper auto-shotgun
	in hand, sizing Quinn up.

				BLADE
		Now don't we look dapper?

	Quinn BELLOWS with rage, ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration
	doors from its hinges, flinging it at Blade like it was lawn
	furniture --

	Blade rolls to the side as the door CRASHES against the wall. Quinn
	runs, moving through the morgue like a human tornado, heading for the
	windows at the end of the room --

	SMASH!!! Out goes Quinn, taking half the wall with him. Blade rushes
	to the decimated window, looks down --

	BLADE'S POV

	Quinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below,
	caving it in. He springs off, loping across the tarmac on three
	limbs, then -SCREECH!-THWUMP!- rolling up onto the hood of an
	oncoming car, before disappearing into the night --

	BACK UP ABOVE,

	Blade spins, SEES Karen bleeding her life away on the floor. She
	reaches a hand out to him, beseeching --

	Blade pulls away from her grasp, takes a step towards the exit --
	then hesitates. 

	A flicker of doubt washes across Blade's face. He looks down at Karen
	once more, wrestling with his conscience, finally making a decision.
	He kneels, scoops Karen up into his arms. Just then, 

	TWO POLICEMEN 

	rush into the morgue, weapons drawn --

				UNIFORM #1
		Hold it, ass-hole!

	Blade ignores them, turning to face the window before him. It's a
	good thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building, a parking
	structure -- and damned if Blade doesn't seem to be considering the
	jump.

	The Police close in, agitated. Blade crouches, switches Karen to a
	one-handed grip --

				UNIFORM #1
		I said hold it!!!

	-- and jumps.

	EXT. HOSPITAL/ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

	Blade clears the impossible distance -- almost. He snags the ledge of
	the adjacent parking structure with his left hand even as Karen slips
	from the grasp of his right --

	-- a last-second save, his fingers clamping around her wrist, is all
	that stands between Karen and street pizza. She SCREAMS anyway,
	dangling below him --

	Blade GRUNTS, swinging Karen like a pendulum, heaving her up and over
	the ledge as if she were a sack of potatoes. She lands on her
	shoulder, clutching it in pain --

	Blade heaves himself up, crouching beside her.

				KAREN
			(gasping)
		My shoulder -- dislocated --

	Blade places a hand on her shoulder, another around her elbow and
	without any consideration to discomfort -CRACK!- brutally pops it
	back in place. Karen SCREAMS again as he scoops her up once more and
	heads for --

	HIS '69 OLDSMOBILE 442, 

	which is parked nearby. Midnight-black. The definitive high-
	performance heavy-metal muscle machine with an engine big enough to
	power an Apollo rocket. 

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade sets Karen down in the passenger seat, climbs behind the wheel,
	keys the ignition. The engine ROARS to life, belching fumes through
	the dual exhaust. Blade floors it, burning serious rubber as the Olds
	vanishes from sight. 

	BACK AT THE DEMOLISHED MORGUE WINDOW 

	as the two policemen stare numbly in open-mouthed astonishment.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

	Blade pilots the Olds down the streets, moving through a series of
	increasingly degenerating neighborhoods, coming at last to the
	sprawling warehouse district.

	EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT 

	The Olds approaches a mammoth industrial facility that's been
	cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire. Ultra-violet
	floodlights illuminate the area, while an army of security cameras
	keep a watchful eye. 

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade glances at Karen, cursing himself for giving into his emotions.
	He hits a remote secured to the sun visor --

	EXT. BLADE'S OLDS/ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

	A gate grinds open. 

	We follow the Olds as it cruises around the back of the building,
	heading down a concrete loading ramp. At the bottom of the ramp, a
	heavy iron door rises. Blade's Olds disappears into the darkness.

	INT. ABANDONED FACTORY, INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	More UV lights flicker on. We're in a massive loading elevator which
	HUMS as it ascends, eventually reaching its destination with a
	BOOMING CLANG. The doors at the rear glide open. Blade guides the
	Olds out.

	INT. ABANDONED FACTORY, WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Set up in an old ironworks, the place looks like a cross between an
	auto junkyard and an armory. Equipment is strewn everywhere --
	lathes, mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical
	theater -- all of it jerry-rigged in a brutal, oily-tech.

	Blade climbs out of the Olds. He opens the passenger door and pulls
	Karen out, carries her in his arms. 

				BLADE
		Whistler!

				WHISTLER (O.S.)
		Are we bringing home strays now?

	ABRAHAM WHISTLER (60s)

	hobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. Gimlet-eyed,
	bitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. Though his face is
	lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense
	he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age. 

				BLADE
		She's been bitten.

				WHISTLER
		You should've killed her, then.

				BLADE
		She hasn't turned yet. 
			(pointedly)
		You can help her.

	Blade and Whistler stare each other down. Finally, Whistler turns and
	heads over to the operating theater.

				WHISTLER
		No promises. You watch her close. She 
		starts to turn, you finish her off.

	Blade nods, lays Karen down on the operating table. Whistler turns on
	an overhead light. Karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. She's lost a
	lot of blood.

	Whistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in
	Karen's neck with an antiseptic swab -- there's capillary damage
	around the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised,
	gangrenous. 

				WHISTLER
		Localized necrosis. She's borderline. 
		Another hour and she'd be well into 
		the change.

	Whistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under Karen's
	nose. As she starts to stir --

				WHISTLER
		Can you hear me, woman? 

	Karen's eyes open wide. She's scared, disoriented --

				KAREN
		What -- ?

				WHISTLER
		You've been bitten by a vampire. We've 
		got to try and burn out the venom, 
		just like a rattlesnake bite --

	Whistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic-looking
	fluid. Karen sees the syringe, resists --

				WHISTLER
		Hold her. 

	Blade forces Karen back. Whistler readies the syringe.

				WHISTLER
			(reading her name tag)
		"Dr. Karen Jansen". Listen close, I'm 
		going to inject you with an antidote 
		made from allium setivum -- garlic. 
		This is going to hurt. A lot. 

	Whistler sinks the needle into Karen's neck and depresses the
	plunger. "Hurt" doesn't begin to describe what Karen experiences
	next. Imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid
	through your veins.

	Karen SHRIEKS, her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms. The wound
	on her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous
	vampire venom.

	Karen clutches at Blade's arms, digging her nails in. She stares up
	at him with unflinching intensity, like a child desperately searching
	for assurance. 

	ON BLADE,

	uncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid. He'd like nothing more
	than to be done with this, but the only thing he can do is hold Karen
	while she rides out the seizures. 

	KAREN'S POV

	growing darker by the moment. The last thing she sees is Blade
	staring down at her -- then the night closes in. 

	INT. HOUSE OF EREBUS, MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club
	massacre. Blade turns and stares into the camera, fires his cross-
	bow. The screen cuts to static.

	A WITHERED, CLAWED HAND

	moves into frame, holding a remote. With a tap of a button, the
	monitor goes dark. 

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL a large, minimalist conference room -- the House
	of Erebus, seat of the vampire race's legislative assembly.

	Gathered around a massive table are the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS,
	representing a "rainbow" of racial colors -- names like PALLINTINE,
	VON ESPER, ASHE, BAVA. Two of them, the FAUSTINAS, are identical
	twins -- lethal-looking women with alabaster skin. 

	Chilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table. From
	time to time, a member will pour themselves a glass, or perhaps, help
	themselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks.

	At the head of the table is GAETANO DRAGONETTI, current vampire
	"Overlord". Blood-red eyes, parchment skin stretched over skull-like
	features. Incalculably ancient, but still deadly and virile as a
	viper. 

	Dragonetti speaks. He uses the "secret tongue" -- the ancient vampire
	language which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable
	of reproducing. 

				DRAGONETTI 
			(subtitled)
		Blade. Once again, our interests have 
		fallen victim to his ridiculous 
		crusade. He must be destroyed.

				FROST (O.S.)
			(in English)
		You're wrong, Dragonetti. 

	All heads turn. Who would dare such impudence?

	DEACON FROST, 

	a mere "Underlord" in the vampire hierarchy, steps forward.
	Strikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors,
	fueled with a passionate intensity. Amongst the vampire community
	he's known as an agitator. He's also the vampire equivalent of a
	racial supremacist.

				FROST
		The Day Walker represents a unique 
		opportunity. We'd be fools to waste 
		it by killing him. 

				DRAGONETTI
			(subtitled, taking umbrage)
		Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our 
		language, you insult the House of 
		Erebus by using the humans' 
		gutter-tongue, have you no respect 
		for tradition? 

				FROST
		Why should I respect something which 
		has outlived its purpose?

	This causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. Frost might as
	well have slapped Dragonetti in the face.

				DRAGONETTI
			(simmering)
		I see. And what would you have us do 
		with this "half-breed"?

				FROST
		Study him. Unlock the secrets of his 
		DNA. He's the key we've been looking 
		for. 

				DRAGONETTI
		He is an abomination! 

	Dragonetti slams his fist down, toppling a carafe, spilling blood
	across the tabletop. Frost looks to the others --

				FROST
		Why should we spend our lives 
		cringing from the daylight when his 
		blood offers us an alternative? 
		Enough talk. It's time we stepped out 
		of the shadows!

	Dragonetti looks apoplectic. ELDER PALLINTINE, a five-hundred year-
	old vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy, interjects.

				PALLINTINE
		You're out of line, Frost.

				FROST
		Am I? Or am I just the first to say 
		out loud what we've all been 
		thinking? 

	The fact that no one answers is telling. Dragonetti glowers at the
	other Elders, sensing the tide turning.

				DRAGONETTI
		The shadows suit us, Frost. We've 
		existed this way for thousands of 
		years. Who are you to challenge our 
		ways?

				FROST
		Someone who's sick of living off 
		scraps. The coming age belongs to us, 
		not the humans! 
			(to the others)
		When the final war between our races 
		comes, who do you want leading the 
		charge? 

	Frost stabs an accusing finger at the Overlord.

				FROST
		Some withered up fossil ready to snap 
		like a brittle bone at the first sign 
		of change?

	Dragonetti GROWLS like an beast, raking his claws across the tyro
	vampire's face, knocking him to the ground. 

				DRAGONETTI
		Get out!!!

	Frost picks himself up, touches the gashes on his cheek. Looks at his
	fingers, licks the blood from them. 

				FROST
		Careful, old fang. You might wake up 
		one day and find yourself extinct.

	Frost smiles at Dragonetti and calmly exits the room.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP, BLADE'S CELL - DAY

	ON KAREN as she comes to. Her wounds have been bandaged. She rises, a
	little shaky, takes in her surroundings -- She's in a spartan room,
	like a monk's cell. On the wall is a collection of knives and
	daggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre-
	looking runes. In the center of these weapons rests --

	BLADE'S SWORD,

	hanging like a cross in a chapel, dominating all else. Karen touches
	it. Then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt
	by a tarnished chain. She reaches for it, opens it --

	The locket features a photo, old and faded. It's the black woman we
	saw in the prologue, Vanessa, standing in the sunshine. 

	Karen moves towards the door, cautious -- 

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	We hear VOICES now, coming from beyond a series of black-out
	curtains. Karen pushes one aside and SEES --

	BLADE

	strapped into some kind of Inquisition-esque restraint chair. His
	shirt is off, his body slick with sweat. Whistler finishes strapping
	Blade in, then stands back, holding up a gas-powered pistol injector,
	hesitant --

				WHISTLER 
		I had to increase the dose. You're 
		building up a resistance to the 
		serum --

				BLADE
			(impatient)
		Just do it, old man.

	Whistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he presses the
	pistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. 

	Blade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard,
	veins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it
	tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his
	credit, Whistler never lets go.

	Mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs
	its violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly
	private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire
	hunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints,
	exhausted. 

	KAREN

	She draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed
	something she shouldn't have. She looks for an exit, SEES another
	doorway. She makes for it -- 

	INT. WHISTLER'S LAB - TANK ROOM - DAY 

	A dusty, darkened hole of a room, no windows, just shadows, crumbling
	concrete, rust stains, and --

	A LARGE TANK

	filled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical leads and
	biomedical sensors. SOMETHING floats within, suspended in the murky
	fluid -- a child , two or three years of age, drifting about like a
	medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde -- 

	THUMP! The child SLAMS up against the glass. Karen backpedals,
	startled. Its eyes are open now, pupils blown. It snarls, revealing a
	mouthful of razored fangs, trailing mouth-slime across the glass as
	it futilely tries to chew its way through to Karen.

	Karen stifles a sob, turning and running right into --

	BLADE,

	who now blocks the exit, sword in hand. Karen retreats a step,
	wary --

				BLADE
		You shouldn't be here.

				KAREN
		I'm sorry, I --

				WHISTLER (O.S.)
		Wandered off the beaten path, Doctor?

	Whistler has entered the room from a second doorway. Karen looks from
	Whistler to Blade, trapped between them --

				KAREN
		Who are you people?

				WHISTLER
		My name is Abraham Whistler.
			(re: Blade)
		This is Blade. As for our little 
		homunculus here --

	Whistler limps over to the tank, rapping his cane against it. The
	creature snaps at it reflexively, following the silver tip back and
	forth like a fish after a lure.

				BLADE
		-- he's a vampire.

				KAREN
		You're joking --

				WHISTLER
		Not at all. You're looking at a prime 
		specimen of the homines nocturna. 

	Whistler toys with the feral creature, engaging in a certain amount
	of sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied.
	Suddenly, it surges towards the top of the tank, clawing at the
	lid --

	Karen becomes alarmed -- but then a massive ELECTRICAL JOLT shocks
	the creature back into submission. 

				WHISTLER
		If Blade hadn't brought you here, you 
		would've wound up like him.

	Karen brings a hand to her bandaged neck, recalling the events of the
	previous night. She looks to Blade.

				KAREN
		Why did you help me?

	Blade scowls, his gaze flickering to Whistler.

				BLADE
		Stupidity.

				WHISTLER
			(appraising her)
		Maybe not. I did some checking, she's 
		a hematologist. Knowledge like that 
		might come in handy.

				BLADE
		It's not worth the risk. We can't 
		trust her.

				KAREN
		Why?

				BLADE
		Because you're tainted. The venom's 
		still inside you. You could still 
		turn on us.

				KAREN
		What happens then?

	Blade looks to Whistler -- as far as he's concerned, the debate's
	over.

				BLADE
		Then I have to take you out, just 
		like any other bloodsucker.

	Blade turns and exits. Whistler and Karen follow.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Beyond the grimy outer windows, we can see that the day is closing --
	long shadows, amber light. Karen lingers in the doorway, reeling from
	information overload. 

	Blade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt -- strapping on body
	armor, loading ammunition. He strings the tarnished locket around his
	neck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil, then pauses to
	inspect a modified pistol, sighting down the length of it.

				BLADE
		We hunt them, moving from one city to 
		the next, tracking their migrations. 
		They're hard to kill. They tend to 
		regenerate.

	CLACK! Blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber, then checks his
	next weapon --

				KAREN
			(sarcastic)
		So what do you use, then? A stake?

				WHISTLER
			(nodding)
		Some of the old wives' tales are true 
		-- they're severely allergic to 
		silver, various types of wood. Feed 
		them garlic and they'll go into 
		anaphylactic shock -- 

	Whistler picks up a customized rifle with a UV entry light, flicking
	on the beam.

				WHISTLER
		-- and of course there's always 
		sunlight, ultra-violet rays. 

	Karen shakes her head, incredulous -- 

				KAREN
		And you honestly expect me to believe 
		all this?

				BLADE
		I don't care what you believe. I 
		saved your life once, I don't plan on 
		making a habit of it. You want my 
		advice, you'll be out of the city by 
		nightfall. If you're stupid enough to 
		stay, that's your business.

				KAREN
		I can't just leave. I have a life 
		here, a career --

				BLADE 
		Not anymore. You've seen one of them. 
		You won't be allowed to live after 
		that. 

	Karen stares at Blade. Whistler gestures to the windows --

				WHISTLER
		There's a war going on out there. 
		Blade, myself, a few others -- we've 
		tried to keep it from spilling over 
		onto the streets. 
			(beat)
		Sometimes people like yourself get 
		caught in the cross-fire. 

	Whistler shrugs. As far as he's concerned, there's nothing else to
	say. Karen is still protesting, though. 

				KAREN
		I can go to the police. I have blood 
		samples back at the hospital. I can 
		show them. 

				BLADE
		Do it. You'll be dead before you can 
		file the complaint.

				KAREN
		That's ridiculous! No one's that 
		powerful. 

	Whistler sighs. He doesn't suffer fools gladly.

				WHISTLER 
		You're talking about a brotherhood 
		that predates the Catholic Church by 
		thousands of years. Their survival 
		depends on their ability to blend in. 
		Chances are, you've encountered them 
		and not even known it. On the subway, 
		in a bar --

	Blade slings his CAR-15 onto his shoulder, impatient. He starts
	towards the Olds, gesturing.

				BLADE
		Get in. Youre leaving.

				WHISTLER
		Wait.

	Whistler tosses a small metal canister to Karen.

				WHISTLER
		Consider it a parting gift. Vampire 
		mace -- silver nitrate, essence of 
		garlic. 

				KAREN
			(in disbelief)
		So that's it? You guys just patch me 
		up and send me on my way?

				WHISTLER
		There is one other thing. I'd buy 
		yourself a gun if I were you. If you 
		start becoming sensitive to the 
		daylight, if you start becoming 
		thirsty regardless of much you've had 
		to drink -- then I suggest you take 
		that gun and use it on yourself. 
		Better that, than the alternative.

	Karen stares at Whistler, horrified, as we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES - DAY

	We are deep in the narrow stacks of a sepulchral archive. Exactly
	what and where this place is will become more clear later on. 

	But for now, the CAMERA DRIFTS through the warren of aisles. Along
	the way, we catch a glimpse of a HULKING SILHOUETTE cowering behind a
	series of Japanese shoji screens. Later on, we find --

	FROST

	tucked away in a carrel, surrounded by books and scriptures, with
	only the SICKLY GLOW of his laptop to provide light.

				DRAGONETTI (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	Frost pauses, SEEING Dragonetti emerge from the shadows.

				DRAGONETTI
			(outraged)
		These archives are restricted to 
		members of the House of Erebus.

				FROST
		Please. You and the other Elders 
		wouldn't know what to do with these 
		texts if your lives depended on it. 
			(cryptically)
		Which, of course, they do.

				DRAGONETTI
		You're wasting your time, Frost. Far 
		greater scholars than you have tried 
		to decipher these words. Whatever 
		secrets they hold have been lost.

				FROST
		Perhaps.

	Frost studies Dragonetti, a self-satisfied grin on his face. If the
	act was intended to unnerve Dragonetti, it succeeded, though the
	ancient vampire would never admit it.

				DRAGONETTI
		What are you up to, Frost?

	Frost shuts the lid on his laptop, rising, drawing intimidatingly
	close to Dragonetti.

				FROST'S VOICE
		Wouldn't you like to know, Old Fang?

	A beat as the young turk stares his elder down. Dragonetti is the
	first to lose his nerve. Frost smiles and exits, leaving the old
	vampire to lick his wounds.

	CAMERA DRIFTS back to the hulking silhouette, which has been
	eavesdropping on the conversation. It quivers in fear.

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS (ON KAREN'S STREET CORNER) - DAY

	Blade brings the car to a stop. Karen looks at him. His eyes are
	hidden behind his glasses, his expression stone.

				BLADE
		Remember what we said. Keep your eyes 
		open. They're everywhere.

	EXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

	As Karen climbs out, Blade swings the door shut behind her. The Olds
	ROARS off down the quiet residential street. 

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - DAY

	Karen crosses the lobby, stepping into an elevator. Just as the doors
	are closing, a WOMAN and TWO MEN duck in alongside her. 

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Silence, the uncomfortableness of an elevator ride magnified tenfold.
	Karen can FEEL the eyes of her fellow passengers upon her. Finally
	succumbing to paranoia, she hazards a glance -- would she be able to
	tell if these people weren't human? The woman turns to Karen,
	smiles --

	Karen surreptitiously fishes the "vampire mace" from her pocket,
	clutching it -- and now one of the men turns to look at her,
	nodding --

	INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

	The elevator doors open. Karen hurries out, heads left, finds herself
	in a deserted hallway. She looks back --

	-- then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out! As Karen raises
	the canister of mace --

	-- the trio turn and head down to the right. Karen breathes a sigh of
	relief, shakes her head.

	INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Karen enters quickly, bolting the door behind her. She picks up the
	phone, dials 911 --

				KAREN
		I need the police. This is an 
		emergency --

	As Karen waits to be connected, she moves to the back entrance and
	checks the locks -- then the windows, then the fire escape --
	finally, a VOICE comes on the other end.

				KAREN
		Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was 
		with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital 
		last night -- that's right, I 
		witnessed the attack --
			(listening)
		115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll 
		wait here. Please hurry.

	Karen hangs up the phone and turns -- 

	A SHAFT OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT

	streams in through a window. Karen forces herself to look at it and
	winces, shielding her eyes. Again, she brings a hand to the bandaged
	wound on her neck. She moves to the window, pulling the shade down,
	frightened.

				KAREN
		Get a grip on yourself, girl.

	She sinks down into a chair to wait, setting Whistler's vampire mace
	aside. Then she shuts her eyes, massaging her temples. We SEE --

	A BRIEF FLASH OF

	Quinn, his mouth opening wide, saliva dripping from his fangs. His
	pupils pulsating hypnotically. We rush into his gaping maw and --

	WHAM! We're back to reality. Karen wakes with a start, looks to the
	windows -- time has passed, it's getting dark outside --

	-- and someone is KNOCKING at the front door. Karen reaches for the
	vampire mace, then moves to the door. She looks through the peephole,
	cautious --

				KAREN
		Who is it? 

	KAREN'S POV (FISH-EYE)

	A POLICE OFFICER stands in the hallway -- 30s, handsome, a knight in
	shining armor as far as she's concerned. 

				GIDEON
		Sergeant Gideon. I'm responding to a 
		911 call. 

	Karen visibly relaxes. She opens the door and steps aside, allowing
	Gideon to enter.

				KAREN
		Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen -- 

	Gideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies
	Karen's face, the bandages on her neck.

				GIDEON
		Are you all right?
			(off Karen's nod)
		I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've 
		been anxious to get a hold of you. You 
		disappeared on us for a while. 

				KAREN
		I know. Listen -- do you have any idea 
		what happened to Curtis, the other 
		doctor?

				GIDEON
			(matter of fact)
		Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry 
		about that if I were you.

				KAREN
			(alarmed)
		Why?

	Gideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun. 

				GIDEON
		Because you're dead too.

	Karen GASPS. She has a half-second to act -- in which she triggers a
	spray of vampire mace into Gideon's face. Gideon stumbles back,
	blinded, cursing, rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes -- 

	Karen expects pyrotechnics -- but the end result is little more than
	an annoyance. A second later, Gideon is simply blinking, sniffing his
	fingers, confused --

				GIDEON
		Garlic?

				KAREN
		He said it would work against 
		vampires --

	Gideon bursts out laughing.

				GIDEON
		Who said I was a vampire? 

	Gideon shakes his head, still snickering. He forces Karen against the
	wall, placing the gun against her head --

				GIDEON
		Thanks for the laugh. You can shut 
		your eyes if you want to.

	CRASH!!! The front door explodes open as Blade comes flying through
	it! 

	Gideon tries to bring his pistol up -- but Blade grips the man's hand
	and squeezes. Gideon SCREAMS as his bones snap like kindling. The
	pistol falls from his grasp --

	Blade fires his fist into Gideon's gut again and again, then flings
	the officer across the room, sending him SMASHING into a glass-cased
	cabinet. Bleeding, battered, Gideon struggles to stand --

	Blade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he
	sinks to the floor in a half-conscious haze.

	Blade stands over Gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing
	heavily, touching down after his adrenaline high. Finally, he looks
	to Karen --

				BLADE
		You okay?

	Karen nods, glances at Gideon --

				KAREN
		How did you know?

				BLADE
		Figured they'd send someone after you. 
		Thought I'd wait around and see who 
		showed up.

				KAREN
		You used me as bait?!

				BLADE
		It worked, didn't it?

				KAREN
		But, he could've --

				BLADE
		He didn't. Get over it.

	Blade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the
	neck, the skin behind the ear -- 

				KAREN
		But he's a policeman --

				BLADE
		He's a familiar. A human who works for 
		the vampires. See this mark?

	Blade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol
	tattooed into the man's scalp.

				BLADE
		That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire 
		cattle brand. That means Officer 
		Friendly here is someone's property. 
		Any of the other vampire's try to 
		bleed him, they'll have to answer to 
		Friendly's owner --
			(studying the glyph)
		This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. 
		We've been tracking him for a while 
		now --

				KAREN
		Why in God's name would anyone want to 
		work for them?

				BLADE
		Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If 
		they're loyal, if they prove 
		themselves, then their masters will 
		turn them. 

				KAREN
		And that's a good thing?

				BLADE
		For some. Live forever, never get old. 
		The ultimate high. 

	Just then, Gideon MOANS. Blade drags the man up so they're eye to
	eye.

				BLADE
		How 'bout you, Officer? You a good 
		little bloodhound?

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

	Blade and Karen are now standing by Gideon's police cruiser which is
	parked outside Karen's apartment. Blade shoves Gideon against the
	hood of the cruiser. He finds Gideon's keys, moves to the trunk,
	opens it --

	IN THE TRUNK --

	A sophisticated medical cooling unit for transporting organs. Blade
	opens the unit, coolant vapor hisses out. Inside are plastic bags
	containing blood. 

				BLADE
		Looks like our friend was 
		blood-running.
			(to Gideon)
		Where were you headed?

	Gideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth --

				GIDEON
		Mphuck you --

	WHAM! Blade plants Gideon's face into the hood of the car. Gideon
	GROANS, coughs --

				GIDEON
		Jesus -- 1227 Brookner -- 
		Holliston Clinic --

	Blade releases him, then reaches for his Casull.

				KAREN
		What are you doing?!

				BLADE
		Preventive medicine.

	Karen steps in front of Blade, shielding Gideon.

				KAREN
		You can't do this, he's human, it's 
		murder.

				BLADE
		It's war, now get the fuck out of the 
		way!

	Karen grabs Blade's arm, wrestling with him, trying to push his hand
	away. As the two of them struggle, Gideon makes a break for it,
	stumbling across the lawn. Blade pushes Karen aside, takes aim,
	FIRES --

	-- but Gideon ducks into an alley, disappearing from sight. Blade
	spins on Karen, enraged --

				BLADE
		God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea 
		what you just did?! He'll warn them. 
		They'll be waiting!

	But Karen's defiant, she's not backing down.

				KAREN
		You were going to kill him. What was I 
		supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and 
		pretend I didn't see what I saw? 

	Blade tears off his glasses. Karen gasps --

	BLADE'S EYES

	aren't human, nor are they vampire. They're something else -- emerald
	green, laced with swirling flecks of red. 

				BLADE
		Let me set you straight on something, 
		Doctor. What you've "seen" so far is 
		nothing. The world you live in's just 
		the sugar-coated topping. There's 
		another world beneath it, the real 
		world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. 
		If you want to survive in it, you'd 
		better pull your head out of your ass. 

	Blade slips his glasses back on, leaving Karen shocked into silence.
	He heads for his Olds without looking back, climbs in, guns the
	engine. In seconds, he's gone, tearing off down the street in a cloud
	of exhaust.

	EXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - DUSK

	We are soaring through the air above the gleaming city skyline,
	moving towards the Edgewood Towers whose windows reflect the blood-
	red sinking sun.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Suffused lighting, elegant tile-work featuring evocative mosaics, the
	quiet strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC -- 

	MERCURY,

	the lupine Gaultier girl from the club, glides beneath the water,
	surfacing at the deep end. We SEE --

	FROST

	lounging in a chair, studying a laptop which rests beside him. On the
	screen is a digitized image -- a page taken from an ancient
	manuscript, written in a secret tongue.

	Officer Gideon waits nearby, cradling his ruined hand, his battered
	face cast downward like a boy who's been called into the Principal's
	office. 

				GIDEON
		Look, I know you're disappointed --

				FROST
		Crestfallen.

				GIDEON
		Blade was waiting for me. There wasn't 
		anything I could do.

	Frost nods, lapsing into brooding contemplation.

				FROST
		Tell me something, Gideon, what blood 
		type are you?

	Gideon hesitates. Is this a trick question?

				GIDEON
		I don't really know --

				FROST
		Take a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps? 
		I'm interested in the antigens here, 
		the agglutination reaction --

	Gideon stammers as Frost rises. In the blink of an eye, Frost lifts
	Gideon from the floor, dangling the Officer over the deep end of the
	pool by his throat --

				FROST
		I'm going to guess AB positive.

	Gideon GURGLES as Frost's fingernails pierce his flesh, drawing
	blood. Then Frost releases him --

	Gideon plunges into the pool. Mercury is on him in a heartbeat,
	tearing him apart like a Great White consuming a piece of chum. The
	water churns violently around them, clouding with red.

	When it's over, Mercury rises from the pool, dripping wet, covered
	from head to toe in a crimson sheen. 

	She kisses Frost hungrily, letting Gideon's blood flow from her mouth
	to his. Frost flicks a tongue over his lips.

				FROST
		AB positive. Give the man a prize.

	Below them, Gideon's lifeless body sinks towards the pool bottom, his
	police badge twinkling like sunken treasure.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

	Blade's Olds cruises to a stop. We're in a low-end commercial
	district -- junky heaven. Blade climbs out, pulling an automatic
	rifle from the back seat, then heading into an alleyway. 

	EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

	Blade makes his way down the alley, cautious -- he SEES mountains of
	trash, boarded-up windows, overlapping layers of gang graffiti -- a
	RAT crouching on a trash dumpster, gnawing on a dead pigeon --

	-- then a SOUND behind Blade, the scuffle of feet -- 

	Blade whirls, drawing his sword, CHARGING at an approaching shadow,
	stopping mere millimeters from decapitating --

	KAREN,

	who's been backed up against the wall, her eyes wide with fright.
	Blade's sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm, having drawn
	just the slightest taste of blood.

				BLADE
		What the hell are you doing?! I could 
		have killed you!

	Blade lowers his sword. Karen remembers to breathe. She slumps,
	tracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with
	her body.

				KAREN
		I remembered the address. I followed 
		you --

	Blade shakes his head, amazed.

				BLADE
		Do you have a death wish or are you 
		just stupid?

	Karen pushes away from the wall, angry --

				KAREN
		Look, if what you say is true, if 
		there's a chance I could turn into one 
		of them, then I've got no choice, do 
		I? I have to work with you. I need to 
		learn everything I can about them. 
		It's the only way I'll be able to find 
		a cure for myself.

				BLADE
		There is no cure. 

				KAREN
			(defiant)
		You don't know that.

	Blade turns and moves to the end of the alley, studying the graffiti-
	covered wall intently --

				KAREN
		What are you looking at?

				BLADE
			(gesturing)
		What do you see here?

				KAREN
		Graffiti --

				BLADE
		Look closer.

	Blade indicates a design amongst the various gang-banger tags that
	looks something like a post-modern hieroglyphic.

				BLADE
		This isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire 
		marking. It means there's a safe-house 
		nearby. 
		A place they can go if dawn is coming. 

	Blade points to a building across the street --

	THE HOLLISTON CLINIC,

	your basic inner-city blood-barter establishment where desperate
	transients parley their plasma into cash.

				KAREN
			(recognizing it)
		I know this place -- it's a blood 
		bank. 

				BLADE
		Owned by vampires. There's one of 
		these in every major city, and just 
		like Domino's, they always deliver.
			(looking to Karen)
		You telling me you're ready to walk 
		through that door?

	Karen nods. Blade continues to stare at her, taking her measure --
	there's a strength in this woman's eyes, she has the soul of a
	fighter -- and Blade recognizes it. 

				BLADE
		All right, then, listen up, Vampire 
		Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water 
		don't do dick, so forget what you've 
		seen in the movies. 

	Blade enumerates the following on his fingers:

				BLADE
		You use the stake, silver, or 
		sunlight, got it? 

	Blade holds up one of his Casulls. 

				BLADE
		Know how to use one of these?

	Karen takes the weapon from him, eyes all over it.

				KAREN
		No.

	Blade takes the gun back, snorting derisively.

				BLADE
		Safety's off, round's already 
		chambered -- 
			(cocking it)
		Silver hollow-points filled with 
		garlic. You aim for the heart or the 
		head, anything else is a one-way 
		ticket to a pine box.

	Blade hand it to her again, then starts across the street towards the
	clinic. Karen follows --

	INT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, LOBBY - NIGHT

	Blade enters, swinging his rifle around for all to see.

				BLADE
		Get out. Now.

	The POTENTIAL DONORS scramble for the exit. Behind the counter,
	TANAKA, a male nurse, reaches for an alarm button. Blade vaults over
	the counter, aiming his rifle. 

				BLADE
		I know you're blood-running. Who's 
		your sponsor? 

				TANAKA
		I don't know what you're --

	POW! Blade backhands him across the face hard enough to loosen his
	teeth. Karen flinches, stepping forward -- 

				KAREN
		What if you've made a mistake?

	Blade pins Tanaka's head to the wall, turning it to the side --
	revealing the man's glyph. It's different than Gideon's, looking more
	like a Japanese kanji character.

				BLADE
		What's this? A birthmark?

	Blade grips Tanaka by his collar, shoving him through a doorway --

	INT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT

	Karen and Blade SEE supply cabinets, cots, a number of locked
	refrigeration units. Blade FIRES into the door handle of one of the
	units, tears it open -- the fridge is stacked floor to ceiling with
	plastic packets of blood.

				BLADE
			(to Karen)
		Still think we might be wrong?
			(to Tanaka)
		How much are you shipping?

				TANAKA
		Bite me!

	Blade opens FIRE, sweeping his rifle around the room, shooting
	everything in sight. Glass cabinetry shatters, ampoules and
	vacutainers go flying. Tanaka cowers, arms wrapped about his head.

	Blade stops shooting. He leans down towards Tanaka, placing the end
	of his rifle against the man's forehead. Tanaka looks like he's about
	to wet his pants.

				BLADE
		I've got a message for your masters -- 
		the night's no longer safe for their 
		kind.

	Blade pulls back his rifle, leaving a red indentation mark where the
	end of the rifle barrel pressed into Tanaka's skin. He starts towards
	the exit. Karen follows.

	CUT TO:

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen return to the Olds. He keys the ignition, lets the
	engine idle. They're parked down the street from the blood clinic.
	Karen looks to Blade, confused --

				KAREN
		You let him go -- 
			(off Blade's nod)
		An hour ago you were ready to kill a 
		man for less, this one didn't even 
		talk.

				BLADE
		He will.

	Blade points --

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

	Tanaka rushes from the clinic, climbing behind the wheel of a Mustang
	parked nearby. He takes off -- 

	Blade follows the Mustang, CLICKING on a cell-phone scanner mounted
	on the dash. Numbers flash on the LCD screen as it searches for a
	signal, then locks onto it. We hear a DIAL TONE, then a number being
	dialed --

				AUTOMATED VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		"You've reached a number that is no 
		longer in service. Please consult your 
		operator and try again".

				TANAKA'S VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		It's Tanaka, PIN number 
		sixteen-zero-zero-nine --

	A "real" voice comes on the line:

				VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		Yes?

	Karen looks to Blade, impressed. 

	INT. TANAKA'S MUSTANG - NIGHT

	Tanaka speeds, shouting into the speaker phone -- 

				TANAKA
		Get me Pearl! 

				VOICE
			(filtered, on speaker)
		Pearl is feeding --

				TANAKA
		Look, I'm not fucking around here! 
		That hunter Frost has been talking 
		about? He was just at the clinic. Tore 
		the goddamn place apart!

	EXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	Tokyo town. A black edifice, no windows, secured parking, no signage
	except for a purple neon scroll above the entrance -- a FLASHING
	KANJI, just like the glyph tattooed on Tanaka's neck.

	Tanaka's Mustang pulls into the parking lot. He climbs out, flagging
	away the valets, heads inside --

	WHIP PAN TO

	Blade's Olds stopping a few blocks down the street.

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade kills the engine, studying The Black Pearl.

				BLADE
		Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place 
		is crawling with them.
			(pointing)
		See the valets over there? They're 
		vampires. So is the doorman.

				KAREN
		How can you tell?

				BLADE
		The way they move, they way they 
		smell --

	Blade continues to scan the area, pointing out a few more likely
	candidates --

				BLADE
		The whore on the corner, she's one 
		too. So are the two men standing under 
		the streetlight.

	Blade reaches into the back seat, retrieves his sword and a satchel.
	He snaps open his shotgun, loads it. Karen continues to study the
	vampires Blade identified.

				KAREN
		So many of them -- I still can't 
		believe they're real.

				BLADE
		There are worse things than vampires 
		out there.

				KAREN
		Like what?

				BLADE
			(pumping his shotgun)
		Like me.

	Blade reaches for the door --

	EXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen climb out. He lets his shotgun fall within the folds
	of his longcoat and starts across the street -- only to be challenged
	by a HULKING DOORMAN at the entrance.

				DOORMAN
		I'm sorry, sir -- do you have an 
		invitation?

	INT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	CRASH! The front door flies open as the Doorman's body sails through.
	Blade enters, Karen at his heels -- 

	The 'Pearl' is an all-hours strip club cum casino catering
	exclusively to Japanese zaibatsu clientele. Dimly lit, the air thick
	with cigarette smoke, deafening MUSIC. Go boards, pachinko machines,
	sexy little MANGA WAIFS in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks --

	STRIPPERS writhe in the circular "pit" tables surrounded by HOWLING
	grab-ass men. But that's nothing compared to --

	The MAIN ATTRACTION,

	who's doing a bump and grind down the runway, shaking a body worthy
	of a schoolboy's wet dream. Her attire? A leather S&M face mask,
	nipple rings, 6-inch spikes, and a pair of panties to hide her
	modesty.

	Blade scans the room -- just in time to see Tanaka ducking into a
	back hallway. Blade pushes towards the rear of the club. Karen
	follows. 

	ON THE STRIPPER

	as she catches sight of Blade and freezes in mid-routine. The
	stripper pulls off her hood. Long black hair with a streak of white
	tumbles down her back -- it's Mercury. 

	INT. BLACK PEARL, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen head past the bathrooms. At the end of the hall is a
	door marked "OFFICE". Just then, the Men's door opens, a DRUNK
	COLLEGE KID steps out, SEES Blade --

				KID
		Hey --

	Blade plants a hand over the kid's face, shoving him back into the
	bathroom as he kicks open the office door --

	INT. THE BLACK PEARL, BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

	Tanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch -- 

	Blade traps Tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. He CRASHES
	into a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. Karen
	winces. Blade grabs a handful of Tanaka's hair, yanks his head up --

				BLADE
		Where's the entrance?!

				TANAKA
		I can't -- they'll kill me!

	Blade rips off his glasses and gives Tanaka an eyeful -- his irises
	pulse and glow. 

				BLADE
		I got news for you, butt-boy. You're 
		already dead. 

				TANAKA
			(terrified)
		Oh God, shit -- behind the bookcase --

	Blade drops Tanaka, moves to the bookcase. He searches the wall a
	moment, then finds a trigger. Hits it -- the bookcase slides aside,
	revealing a hidden elevator. As Blade moves to put his sunglasses
	back on --

	BLADE'S POV (IN THE REFLECTION OF HIS SUNGLASSES)

	We see Tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer,
	swinging it up --

	Blade unholsters one of his Casulls faster than any gunslinger in
	history. He FIRES over his own shoulder, BLOWING Tanaka back against
	the wall. 

	Blade puts his sunglasses back on, motions to the elevator, then nods
	to Karen --

				BLADE
		After you. 

	INT. THE BLACK PEARL, ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	The elevator descends. Then a tone CHIMES, signaling the end of the
	ride. The doors hiss open -- 

	INT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen enter the narrow, maze-like "stacks" of the vampire
	archives, weaving their way through shelves of climate-controlled,
	digitized records. 

				KAREN
		What is this place?

				BLADE
		Some kind of archive --

				KAREN
		Isn't this all a little high-tech? I 
		thought vampires were more into 
		cobwebs and coffins.

				BLADE
		You've been watching too much TV. 
		They've got their claws sunk into 
		everything -- finance, real estate, 
		politics. Probably own half of 
		Downtown. 

	Blade pulls a CD-ROM from the shelves, its spine labeled in
	indecipherable vampire glyphs.

				BLADE
		This must be where they keep their 
		records --

	He pauses, hearing a DISTANT WHISPER. Blade signals quiet, silently
	leading Karen through the stacks towards -- 

	PEARL'S LAIR

	A vestibule of sorts, leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of
	rice paper shoji screens and tatami mats. Candles glow within,
	illuminating a MONSTROUSLY OBESE SHADOW beyond the translucent rice
	paper walls.

	The shadow speaks in a tremulous, bird-like voice -- the secret
	tongue. As Blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes --

				PEARL'S VOICE
			(frightened)
		Lorca, is that you?

	Blade slides open the nearest shoji screen --

	INT. PEARL'S BED CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Nothing Karen's seen up until this point could prepare her for the
	archive's curator --

	PEARL,

	a nine-hundred-pound androgynous vampire of Asian origin, lounging
	amidst pillowed rice mats, wearing a communications headset. Think of
	a cross between Divine and Jabba The Hutt. Skin the complexion of
	buttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood
	that he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin. 

	Pearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have
	been affixed to counter-balanced arms -- this way, Pearl can access
	information without leaving bed.

	Lying next to Pearl, dwarfed by the vampire's massive size, is the
	chalk-white body of a recently-drained NAKED BOY. 

	At the sight of Blade, Pearl's eyes widen in fear --

				PEARL
			(into a speakerphone)
		He's here!

				FROST'S VOICE
			(over speakerphone)
		Congratulations, Day-Walker.

				BLADE
		Frost?

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Frost paces the length of his pool, wearing a hands-free
	communications headset, grinning.

				FROST
		In the flesh, Blade. I understand 
		you've been looking for me. I'm 
		flattered.

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

	As Blade listens, Pearl reaches for his trackball, attempting to
	delete the document currently on his monitors -- but Blade lunges
	forward, sinking the tip of his sword into Pearl's fleshy throat.
	Pearl freezes. 

				BLADE
			(eyeballing Pearl)
		Don't be. You're another notch on my 
		sword hilt, nothing else.

	Frost's DEEP LAUGHTER drifts from the speakerphone.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Frost settles into his chair, enjoying the cat and mouse.

				FROST
		You're quick, Blade, I'll give you 
		that. In the space of an hour you've 
		crossed my familiar, destroyed a blood 
		bank --
			(beat)
		Now here you are in the heart of our 
		archives, terrorizing our curator.

				PEARL'S VOICE
		He has a knife to my throat, Frost! 
		He --

				FROST
			(cutting him off)
		You're history, Pearl. Have the good 
		grace to die with some dignity.
			(beat)
		Round one to you, Blade.

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

	CLICK, the line goes dead. Blade tosses his satchel on the bed, opens
	it. Inside is a hand-held UV lamp hooked up to a nine-volt battery.
	Pearl eyes the device, fearful -- 

				PEARL
		What is that?

				BLADE
		A sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty 
		questions. Depending on your answers, 
		you might get to have yourself a 
		tanning session. 

	Blade looks to Pearl's monitor and SEES a digitized image, the SAME
	MANUSCRIPT Deacon had been studying earlier. 

				BLADE
		What were you in such a big hurry to 
		delete just now?

	Pearl hesitates. Blade turns on the lamp. Pearl HOWLS as the harsh
	light falls upon him. Blade flicks the light off.

	Pearl cringes, GROWLING, his face smoking profusely. Exposure to the
	UV rays, even for one short second, has made his face blister like a
	plague victim's.

				PEARL
			(relenting)
		It's an epistle, a letter Frost has 
		been translating -- it prophesizes 
		LaMagra's return.

				BLADE
		And who is LaMagra?

	Pearl hesitates again -- Blade turns on the lamp for a longer time.
	Pearl thrashes, covering his face. His hands blacken, the skin
	sizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath. Karen has to avert
	her gaze --

	Blade turns off the lamp. Pearl SNARLS, his body quivering with
	poisonous rage.

				PEARL
		LaMagra is The Sleeper!!! 

	Blade leans in close so he's eye to eye with Pearl.

				BLADE
		Where's the original, Pearl? You must 
		have it around here somewhere.

	Pearl sweats blood, his flaking, slug-like lips quivering. 

				PEARL
		The vault --

	Blade follows Pearl's eyes to an armored door, then he stands back,
	handing the UV rig to Karen.

				BLADE
		If he moves, cook him.

	Blade approaches the vault door, sizing up its locking mechanism. He
	pulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the
	door, arming it with a BEEP!

				PEARL
		Please, I'll give you the combination 
		-- you'll damage the documents --

				BLADE
		That's the point.

	Enraged, Pearl LUNGES from his bed. Karen triggers the UV rig, flash-
	frying him to a blackened crisp. Pearl quivers, his enormous body
	smoking like a piece of charred meat. 

	Blade looks back at Karen with newfound respect. She shrugs.

				KAREN
		He moved.

	Blade turns back to the vault, setting off the charge. BOOM! Blade
	kicks the damaged door in, knocking it clear off its hinges --

	INSIDE THE VAULT,

	ancient papers flutter through the smoky air like wind-borne leaves.
	Blade and Karen SEE a lucite-encased document -- fragments of an
	ancient, calligraphied papyrus. 

				KAREN
		What are these?

				QUINN (o.s.)
		Curiosity killed the cat.

	Blade and Karen spin --

	-- QUINN,

	Mercury, and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the
	vault.

				QUINN
			(grins)
		Hola, amigo. Remember me?

	Karen triggers the UV light, but Mercury ducks under it, ripping it
	from her hands, crushing it. In a split-second, the she-demon has her
	claws around Karen's throat.

	As Blade reaches for his rifle, the vampires converge on him like
	quicksilver. They drag Karen and Blade out --

	PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER

	The vampires fling Blade against the wall, pinning him. 

				QUINN
		You took my arm, Blade. But that's 
		okay, I'm growing a new one --

	Quinn lifts up his "arm". A skeletal forearm has grown from the
	stump. It's got cartilage, sinew, and muscle, but no flesh yet. 

				QUINN
		Nice, huh? Think I'll ever play the 
		piano again?
			(shrugging)
		You can slice him, you can dice him, 
		and the man just keeps on coming. 

	Blade struggles violently, but Quinn is upon him, pounding his fist
	into Blade again and again and again -- giving him payback with
	compounded interest. When it's over, Quinn steps back, winded -- 

	Blade's head hangs down. He gasps, wincing, every breath sending a
	red hot poker to his gut. Quinn grabs a hold of Blade's jaw, forcing
	his head up. 

				QUINN
		Stay with me, sweetness, I'm not 
		through with you yet.

	Quinn pulls Blade's jacket open, sees the bandoleer of mahogany
	stakes. He tugs one out, admiring it.

				QUINN
		Teak. Nice craftsmanship. 
			(to the others)
		Now here's a man who takes his job 
		just a little too seriously, don't you 
		think?
			(back to Blade)
		Which reminds me, Blade, think I owe 
		you one --

	Quinn stabs the stake into Blade's shoulder. Blade CRIES OUT, tries
	to pull free. Karen, who's being held by Mercury, averts her gaze.

				QUINN
		Actually, if you want to get 
		technical, I owe you two.

	As Quinn reaches for another stake, Blade starts to laugh.

				QUINN
		What's so funny, bright eyes?

				BLADE
		I'm expecting some company.

	It's then that Quinn notices the micro ear-coil radio receiver in
	Blade's ear. As we MOVE IN on it, we hear a tiny VOICE squawking from
	it:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Get down!

	Blade kicks his feet out, sending Quinn flying backwards. He tears
	free of the vamps holding him and DIVES forward, knocking Karen to
	the ground just as --

	BOOM!!! The wall of Pearl's bedchamber EXPLODES INWARD, knocking
	Quinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet. 

	WHISTLER

	stands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his
	cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other. He balances the
	rifle against his hip like an over-the-hill gunslinger and OPENS FIRE
	on the vampires.

	Blade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown
	free from the vault. Seconds later, he and Karen are fleeing after
	Whistler, retreating back through his newly created exit.

	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	The three of them find themselves ankle-deep in a flooded sewer
	tunnel running parallel to the archives. Whistler pauses, wheezing
	from overexertion. 

				WHISTLER
		Christ, I'm too old for this. Somebody 
		get me a goddamn wheelchair.

	Blade leans against the tunnel wall, GRUNTING as he yanks the stake
	from his shoulder. He then pulls out a light-stick, snapping it,
	illuminating the area in a GREEN GLOW -- disturbing waves of
	GLITTERING COCKROACHES. 

	Meanwhile, Whistler pulls another explosive device from his backpack
	and sets it against the tunnel wall, arming it.

				KAREN
		How did you find us?!

	Whistler taps a tiny radio headset curled around his ear.

				WHISTLER
		We keep in radio contact. 

				KAREN
			(incredulous)
		You've been listening in the whole 
		time?

				WHISTLER
		You think I'd let him run loose 
		without a chaperone? Blade ferrets 
		their rat-holes out, I map them. Then 
		we blow them all to kingdom come.

	Whistler finishes arming the explosive device. It BEEPS. He turns
	back to Blade and Karen, referring to a handheld navigation device.

				WHISTLER
		There's a subway line due East of 
		here. We'd best make tracks. 

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER, ARCHIVES - NIGHT

	An EXPLOSION rips through the bedchamber, mushrooming outward --

	INT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	The EXPLOSION continues expanding, sending tables, drinks, and
	zaibatsu clientele flying.

	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	As the group splashes through the water, a FIREBALL chases them down
	the tunnel. They duck into an alcove, narrowly avoiding the flames.
	Whistler WHOOPS with excitement, loving every minute of it. But his
	triumph is short-lived, for now we hear --

	-- a deafening chorus of HIGH-PITCHED VAMPIRE WAR CRIES coming from
	behind. Karen hazards a look back --

	THE VAMPIRES

	surge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on high-octane.
	There must be a dozen of them now and Quinn is right in the lead.

	Our trio hustles along, but Whistler stumbles, tumbling and sliding
	down a washout. The steep incline of the washout makes it virtually
	impossible for Whistler to climb back up to the main tunnel.

				KAREN
		Whistler!

				WHISTLER
		Go on, I'll be fine!

	Karen hesitates, but Blade yanks her down the tunnel --

				BLADE
		He can take care of himself! GO!!!

	They race through the twisting warren of tunnels, taking one turn
	after another, the vampires hot on their heels --

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen stumble out into a larger subway tunnel, which widens
	into a station stop up ahead. We can see the RED TAIL-LIGHTS of a
	train just pulling away from the platform -- Blade and Karen re-
	double their efforts, lungs burning, legs pumping like mad. Just as
	the train enters the next tunnel --

	-- they leap, dragging themselves up onto the back of the rear-
	passenger car. Blade SMASHES his fist through the emergency exit
	window, then lifts Karen up, helping her climb through into the
	car -- 

	-- but the vampires are still coming! Crawling along the tunnel walls
	on all fours, limbs a blur, claws striking the concrete and spewing
	out sparks. Closing fast. Too fast. 

	QUINN

	springs forward, snagging Blade's ankle with his "good" hand. The
	vampire's weight threatens to haul Blade down. Blade reaches to his
	back-scabbard, unsheathes his sword --

	THUNK! Blade brings the sword down on Quinn's good arm, cutting it
	off at the wrist! Quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels
	back into the darkness --

	THE AMPUTATED HAND,

	which continues to clutch at Blade's ankle, starts to melt. With a
	cry of disgust, Blade kicks the thing away. He turns and climbs
	through the window --

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 

	Karen helps Blade inside. He sinks to the floor of the otherwise
	deserted car, exhausted. He's looking ashen now. The whites of his
	eyes are shot through with red.

	Karen gets a good look at Blade's wounds -- the front of his jacket
	is soaked in blood. She reaches for him --

				KAREN
		You're hurt --

				BLADE
		Nothing that won't heal by dawn.

	Blade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small, gas-powered
	pistol-injector we saw Whistler inject him with earlier. He tries to
	load one of the ampoules into it, but because of his wounds, he's not
	having much luck -- 

				BLADE
			(frustrated)
		I need help with this --

	Karen nods, inserting the ampoule into the gun. Blade shrugs off his
	jacket, holds out his arm. Karen pauses --

				KAREN
		What am I injecting you with?

				BLADE
			(weakly)
		Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin 
		substitute.

	Karen locates a vein, presses the injector against it -- Blade
	tenses, grits his teeth, fights to keep his body thrashing as the
	serum enters his bloodstream. He grips the wall behind him --
	actually digs his nails into the metal surface -- the agony he's
	going through is excruciating, like nothing we could imagine. 

	When it's over, he slumps forward, spent, vulnerable, flushed with
	sweat. Karen stares at him --

				KAREN
		You're one of them, aren't you?

	Blade turns away from Karen, filled with self-loathing. 

				BLADE
		Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, 
		half-vampire.

	Off Karen's surprised reaction, we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	The loading elevator CLANGS to a stop. Blade throws the gate open.
	Karen helps him out. Now that they're safely back, the last of
	Blade's strength seems to dissipate. 

	WHISTLER

	is waiting for them, sitting at a workbench. 

				WHISTLER
		What took you so long?

				BLADE
		Don't even start, old man.

	Blade throws his sword aside, then moves off into the shadows,
	disappearing beyond the curtains. Karen looks to Whistler --

				KAREN
		Why didn't you tell me the truth 
		about him?

				WHISTLER
		We weren't sure we could trust you.

	Whistler sighs, removing his glasses.

				WHISTLER
		Blade's mother was attacked by a 
		vampire while she was pregnant. 
		Ultimately, she died, but her unborn 
		child lived. Unfortunately, he'd 
		undergone certain genetic changes 
		while in the womb --

	Whistler reaches for a pack of cigarettes, pulls one out. He thumbs a
	match, fires up. Takes a long drag --

				WHISTLER
		I found Blade when he was thirteen. 
		He'd been living on the streets, 
		feeding off the homeless. Apparently 
		the Thirst manifested itself at 
		puberty -- 
			(beat)
		I took him for one of them at first, 
		almost killed him, too. But then I 
		realized what he was. 

	CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Frost stands at the window, looking out at the glimmering cityscape
	before him.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Frost turns away from window. Quinn, Mercury, and the other vampires
	from the Black Pearl stand before him. Quinn cradles his amputated
	stump with his newly grown arm. 

				QUINN
		He took my fucking hand! Again!

				FROST
		You seem to be in the habit of losing 
		them fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the 
		amputee lifestyle just suits you.

	The other vampires laugh. Quinn stares them into silence. 

				QUINN
		We need to find him, tonight.

	Frost claps a hand on Quinn's shoulder.

				FROST
		Down, boy. Blade's not going anywhere. 
		I promise. Right now, though, we've 
		more pressing business --
			(off Mercury's look)
		It's time Dragonetti paid the piper. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Whistler studies Karen, exhaling another lungful of smoke.

				WHISTLER
		Blade's unique, you know. A one in a 
		billion anomaly. He can withstand 
		sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he 
		still has the Thirst. 

				KAREN
		What happens if he doesn't take the 
		serum?

				WHISTLER
		The Thirst overcomes him, just like 
		the others. It's not something he can 
		control. 
			(sighs)
		The problem is, time's running out. 
		His body's starting to reject the 
		serum. And so far, all my efforts to 
		find a cure have ended in failure --

				KAREN
		No offense, Whistler, but you're not 
		exactly working with state of the art 
		equipment here. You might have missed 
		something.

				WHISTLER
			(pointedly)
		Which is why you're here. We could use 
		someone with your experience.

	A beat passes between them and Karen knows where she stands now. In
	for a penny, in for a pound. Whistler reaches for Blade's sword.

				WHISTLER
		This used to be mine, you know. It's 
		been passed down through the 
		centuries, from one hunter to the 
		next --

	Whistler extends the sword, sighting down the length of it. He takes
	a few practice parries -- it's obvious he used to be quite skilled in
	the art of swordsmanship.

				KAREN
		Why do you hunt them?

				WHISTLER
		Habit, mostly, just like this. 

	Whistler gestures with his cigarette. He finally stubs it out, his
	wistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke.

				WHISTLER
		I had a family once -- a wife, three 
		daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon 
		Frost came calling one evening --

				KAREN
		He killed them?

				WHISTLER
		Eventually. He toyed with them first. 
		He made me choose, do you understand? 
		Which order they would die in --

	Karen stares at Whistler, horrified.

				KAREN
		How did you escape?

				WHISTLER
		I didn't. He was cruel enough to let 
		me live.
			(slapping his brace)
		Even gave me a souvenir to remember 
		him by.

	Karen nods -- it's all falling into place for her now.

				KAREN
		And now you're using Blade to exact 
		your revenge?

				WHISTLER
			(pointedly)
		Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and 
		I'm not getting any younger, am I?

	Just then, we hear a SCREAM come from Blade's room, sounding more
	like the cry of a beast than a man. Karen takes a step towards
	Blade's room --

				WHISTLER
		I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
		It's best to leave him alone when he's 
		like this.

				KAREN
		I'll take my chances.

	INT. BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Karen enters. It's dark, just a trace of moonlight.

				KAREN
		Blade?

	No answer. Then Karen SEES him -- crouched in the corner of the room
	like some kind of nocturnal animal.

				KAREN
		It's dark in here.

				BLADE
		You get used to the darkness.

	Karen takes a step towards him.

				KAREN
		Whistler told me about your mother. 

	Blade clutches the silver locket in his hand. It swings back and
	forth, like a pendulum.

				BLADE
		I can't close my eyes without hearing 
		her scream.

				KAREN
		Those aren't real memories. No one has 
		that kind of recall.

				BLADE
		I do. I remember from day one. People 
		staring at me, sensing I was 
		different. Watching the fear grow in 
		their eyes, knowing in their hearts I 
		wasn't human.

				KAREN
		If you're not human, then why do you 
		bleed like us? 
		I've seen vampire blood, you don't 
		have it running through your veins.

	Blade looks at Karen, his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight.

				BLADE
		Just get out of here.

				KAREN
		Blade --

	Blade turns, his eyes glowing with preternatural fury. 

				BLADE
		I said, GET OUT!!!

	Karen backs away, startled by Blade's vehemence. She exits, leaving
	him alone with his demons. He holds up one of his empty serum
	ampoules, crushing it in his fist.

				FROST'S VOICE
		Rise and shine, little wing.

	EXT. THE BURNING GROUNDS - JUST BEFORE DAWN

	FADE IN on Dragonetti, his face covered with a black condemned man's
	hood --

	Frost stands before him, grinning like the Cheshire Cat. He's dressed
	from head to toe in a black motorcycle suit -- boots, gloves, a
	visored helmet tucked under one arm. Mercury and Quinn are standing
	nearby, similarly attired. 

	We're on a stretch of rocky coastline, tucked away in a secluded
	cove. Dragonetti has been stripped bare, chained like Prometheus to
	an ancient standing stone. 

				DRAGONETTI
			(straining)
		What is this? Where am I?!

	Frost steps forward, pulling Dragonetti's hood off. Dragonetti stares
	at his surroundings, horrified.

				FROST
		When was the last time you stopped to 
		appreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti? 
		Three, four hundred years? 

	Frost checks his watch, then looks to the ocean. On the horizon, a
	sliver of gold appears. 

				FROST
		How do you like that? Right on time.

				DRAGONETTI
			(snarling)
		The other elders will never let you 
		get away with this!

	Just then, the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS emerge behind Frost, forming a
	circle around Dragonetti. All wear business suits, gloves, along with
	high-tech "sun masks" to protect their faces from the light's lethal
	rays. 

	They stare at Dragonetti like a silent jury. His face darkens, anger
	rising -- but there's a desperation in his eyes now too. He speaks in
	the secret tongue:

				DRAGONETTI
			(subtitled)
		Don't you see, you fools?! He'll 
		betray you too! He's planning on 
		invoking LaMagra himself!

	The vampires just smile and shake their heads.

				FROST
		The wheel turns, old fang. Guess you 
		just got a little too long in the 
		tooth.

	Dragonetti's cries are cut short as Frost forces the aging vampire's
	mouth open, ripping out his fangs with his bare hands. Dragonetti
	GURGLES and SHRIEKS, sounding like a dying animal.

	Frost turns to face the Twelve now, his eyes bright with victory. He
	pulls on his motorcycle helmet, as do Mercury and Quinn. 

	Behind them, Dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no
	avail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him, channeled
	inward by the natural formation of the cove -- 

	Dragonetti HOWLS, his skin beginning sizzle and smoke. Then he
	catches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass. He thrashes about
	as his flesh starts to run from his body.

	THE VAMPIRE ELDERS

	watch, impassive, protected by their masks --

	-- when suddenly, TWELVE FIGURES rise up behind them, clad in bike
	helmets and black leather, just like Frost. The intruders grip each
	of the Elders in a strangle hold, ripping their masks off. 

				FROST
		Dragonetti was right. You were fools 
		to trust me.

	Frost flips down the visor of his helmet even as --

	THE RED SUN

	rises in all its fiery glory.

	One by one, the vampire Elder's heads catch fire, skullflesh sizzling
	away -- burning down the line of them in successively building
	intensity until all twelve EXPLODE in a conflagration of BLINDING
	WHITE LIGHT.

	Frost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer
	intensity of the occult blast -- a blast which sends the skeletal
	bodies of the Elders SLAMMING into the rock wall.

	When it's over, Frost picks himself back up. We SEE that the only
	thing left of Dragonetti and the others are --

	THIRTEEN SHADOW SILHOUETTES

	permanently etched onto the rock's surface, just like the bombing
	victims of Hiroshima. 

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Karen stands at a lab table with Whistler, preparing a number of
	blood sample vials. They are surrounded by host of new medical
	equipment -- from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond.

	Blade emerges from his room, looks to Karen. As if by silent
	agreement, last night's words go unacknowledged. He straps on his
	bandoleer of stakes, secures his scabbard.

				WHISTLER
		Going somewhere?

				BLADE
		China Town. I need more serum.
			(re: new equipment)
		What's all this?

				KAREN
		I made a trip to the hospital last 
		night, borrowed some equipment.

				BLADE
			(sarcastic)
		For your miracle cure? 

				WHISTLER
		She's been making real progress, 
		Blade.
			(to Karen)
		Show him --

	Karen looks to Blade, who shrugs. She opens a refrigerator, removing
	a syringe filled with blue fluid.

				KAREN
		This is sodium citrate. It's an 
		anti-coagulant. We use it to treat 
		blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood 
		is thinner than humans, though. Watch 
		what happens when I introduce some 
		into a sample --

	Karen gestures to the microscope. Blade takes a look --

	BLADE'S POV

	Vampire blood cells swirling about.

	Karen injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells --
	the reaction is immediate. The vampire blood turns black, then begins
	violently bubbling.

	Blade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time -- the
	blood on the slide atomizes, exploding outward in a fine mist which
	bursts apart the glass lens of the scope. 

	Whistler laughs, thrilled with the results.

				WHISTLER
		Can you imagine what a dash of that 
		would do on your sword? 

	Whistler claps his hand on Karen's shoulder in approval, then limps
	away, quickly busying himself with another project. Blade moves to
	follow, but Karen stops him --

				KAREN
		Before you go, I'd like to take a 
		sample of your blood.

	Blade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve. As Karen takes her sample,
	Blade looks to Whistler. The older man brings a handkerchief to his
	lips, coughing into it. 

				KAREN
		Is he sick?

				BLADE
		Cancer.

	Karen watches as Blade's blood flows into the vacutainer. She fills
	the first, then inserts another. 

				KAREN
		You care about him, don't you? 

				BLADE
		We've got a good arrangement, that's 
		all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use 
		them, the vampires die -- end of 
		story.

	Karen finishes. Blade rolls up his sleeve.

				KAREN
			(pointedly)
		My mother used to say that a cold 
		heart is a dead heart.

				BLADE
		Your mother sounds like a Hallmark 
		greeting card. 

	Blade slips his Casulls into a shoulder holster, then shrugs into his
	leather jacket, donning his sunglasses.

				BLADE
		I'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never 
		put much stock in optimism.

	He heads towards the elevator.

	EXT. CHINATOWN, STREETS - DAY

	Blade makes his way down a street lined with vending stalls --
	passing MERCHANTS peddling exotic vegetables and cheap curios,
	butcher shops with rows of roast ducks in the window, tyro GANG-
	BANGERS lounging at the entrance to a video arcade.

	BLADE'S POV

	Even though the streets are crowded, the people seem to make way for
	him, avoiding eye-contact. 

	Blade turns into a dark alley, ducking into the doorway of a hole-in-
	the-wall herbalist shop.

	INT. HERBALIST SHOP - DAY 

	A bell atop the door JINGLES, announcing Blade's arrival. We're in a
	dusty, cave-like room filled with baskets and bottle-lined shelves
	featuring things like "Toad Spleen Extract" and "Barking Deer Wine".
	Joss sticks burn, sending wispy tendrils of incense into the air. 

	At the back of the shop, an elderly CHINESE MAN in a cardigan sits in
	front of a battered television, watching a boxing match. He's eating
	a bowl of litchi fruit. On the counter nearby, a SPIDER MONKEY
	watches attentively. 

				BLADE
		How's it going, Kam?

				KAM
			(re: calendar)
		You're a week early.

				BLADE
		I was in the neighborhood.

	Kam sets his fruit bowl aside, leads Blade through a curtain into a
	back room.

	INT. HERBALIST SHOP, BACK ROOM - DAY

	Kam hands Blade a leather valise. He opens it -- its lined with tiny
	ampoules of scarlet-colored serum. Blade pulls one out, holds it up
	to the light.

				BLADE
		Whistler says I'm building up a 
		resistance to it.

				KAM
		I was afraid that might happen.

				BLADE
		Maybe it's time to start exploring 
		other alternatives.

				KAM
		There's only one alternative to the 
		serum.

	Blade nods. They both know what that "alternative" is. 

				BLADE
		Yeah. I know.

	Blade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket. 

				BLADE
		Thanks, Kam.
			(thinking)
		One other thing. Have you ever heard 
		of a vampire called the Sleeper?

	Kam shakes his head. Blade pulls out the parchment he took from
	Pearl.

				BLADE
		I found this in there archives. I need 
		to find someone who can read their 
		language. 

	Kam studies the parchment.

				KAM
		I've heard about a woman named 
		Miracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a 
		Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives 
		in that tent community down by the 
		city dump. I'm told she only sees 
		people at night. 

	Blade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains.

	EXT. CHINATOWN, STREET - DAY

	Blade emerges from the alley into the sunlight, then hears his name
	WHISPERED on the wind.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Blade.

	Blade spins, scanning his surroundings -- did he really hear his
	name, or was it just the wind?

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Blade.

	Again, the taunting voice calls him. Blade's gaze finally settles
	on --

	A MAN

	sitting on a bench in the deep shade, his face obscured by the
	Chinese newspaper he's reading. There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly
	beside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face. 

				MAN
		Afternoon, Blade.

	The man lowers his newspaper. It's Deacon Frost. He's wearing
	sunglasses, but otherwise, he's seemingly unprotected by the sun. 

	Blade reaches for his .454 -- 

				FROST
		Easy.

	Frost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. We see his claws
	extend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin.

				FROST
		Wouldn't want our little friend here 
		to wind up on the back of a milk 
		carton, would we? 

	Blade reluctantly lowers his hand. Frost smiles. He takes in a deep
	breath of air, savoring it. 

				FROST
		Beautiful day, isn't it? 

				BLADE
			(confused)
		How can you be out here?

				FROST
		I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical 
		research. We've developed a type of 
		sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a 
		few others things. 

	On closer examination we see that Frost is wearing a translucent
	lotion on his face. He touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of
	the lotion between his fingers.

				FROST
		It's not very effective in direct 
		sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, 
		of course, is to be like you, "the 
		Day-walker". 

				BLADE
		I don't buy it.

				FROST
		Why not? The future of our race runs 
		through your bloodstream. You've got 
		the best of both worlds, Blade. All of 
		our strengths and none of our 
		weaknesses.

				BLADE
		Maybe I don't see it that way.

				FROST
		Oh, so it's back to pretending we're 
		human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle 
		Tom routine. You can't keep denying 
		what you are. You're one of us, Blade. 
		You always have been.

				BLADE
		You're wrong.

				FROST
		Am I? You think the humans will ever 
		accept a half-breed like you? They 
		can't. They're afraid of you. 
			(pointedly)
		The humans fear us because we're 
		superior. They fear us because in 
		their hearts they know their race has 
		become obsolete.

	Frost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt. 

				FROST
		Look at them, just an endless stream 
		of cattle in a mad race to the 
		slaughterhouse. 

	Frost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. He
	smacks his lips, sighs contentedly --

				FROST
		The pause that refreshes --
			(offering it to Blade)
		Care for some? Smells good, doesn't 
		it? Pungent, with just an 
		irrepressible hint of iron. 

				BLADE
		Pass.

				FROST
		You sure now? I bled a newborn for 
		this. You won't find a drink that's 
		sweeter. 

	It takes every ounce of Blade's self-control to keep from attacking
	Frost -- and Frost senses this, pressing his sharp thumbnail against
	the child's jugular.

				FROST
		Tell me honestly, do you really get 
		the same rush from that pasteurized 
		piss-serum of yours?
			(off Blade's look)
		You're surprised I know about your 
		serum? You shouldn't be. I know 
		everything about you. 

	Frost leans forward, grinning.

				FROST
		You can't keep walking the razor's 
		edge, Blade. The day will come -- and 
		soon, when you'll have to choose 
		between our kind and their's. If I 
		were you, I'd take care not to wind up 
		on the wrong end of the fang.

	A bead of sweat runs down Frost's neck, washing away a minute amount
	of the sun-blocking cream. The patch of exposed skin instantly
	blackens. Frost gazes upwards at the sun.

				FROST
		Love to continue this chat, but it 
		appears I'm melting.

	Frost rises, taking the little girl by the hand. Blade follows, his
	hand resting on the butt of his Casull.

				BLADE
		You're not going anywhere.

				FROST
			(growling)
		Watch me.

	Frost's eyes flicker towards the street -- a CITY BUS is rumbling by.
	In a heartbeat, Frost hurls the little girl forward --

	-- out into the path of the oncoming bus! 

	Blade has a split-second to act. It's Frost or the girl -- and for a
	moment we actually think he's going to go for Frost --

	-- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms,
	throwing themselves out of the bus' path. The bus misses them by a
	hair. By the time Blade looks up again --

	-- Frost is gone. Blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as
	market-goers gather around him.

	WHIP PAN TO --

	SOMEONE sitting astride a motorcycle, watching Blade from the roof of
	an elevated parking garage. The rider is clad from head to toe in a
	helmet and black leather -- Mercury. 

	EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

	Blade's Olds cruises into the gated grounds. It zips down the ramp
	way into the loading elevator.

	BACK BY THE TRAIN TRACKS --

	Mercury's cycle rolls into frame. She picks up a radio handset and
	keys it.

				MERCURY
			(into radio)
		This is Mercury. Tell Deacon I've 
		found their hiding place.

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Blade enters through the loading elevator, finding Karen and Whistler
	hard at work. She turns as he approaches -- SEES him back-lit by the
	sun. She looks pale, the whites of her eyes are streaked with red.

				BLADE
		Any progress?

				KAREN
		Some. It's been slow --

				BLADE
		You don't look so good. 

				KAREN
		I'm just tired, that's all. We've been 
		up all night.

	Blade nods, not buying her explanation. He shoots a glance to
	Whistler, which doesn't go unnoticed by Karen.

				KAREN
		Excuse me.

	Karen turns, heading for the back of the workshop.

	INT. WORKSHOP - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Karen enters a dingy bathroom, turning on the overhead bulb. She
	studies her reflection in the mirror above the sink, then grimaces as
	she peels the dressing from her wound -- the wound is clearly
	infected, gangrenous. 

				BLADE (O.S.)
		It's started.

	Karen spins, startled. Blade stands behind her. He grips her jaw,
	turning her head so he can better view the wound.

				BLADE
		You've got another day or two at most.

	Karen nods, shaken. As she moves to leave, Blade reaches for her arm,
	stopping her.

				BLADE
		For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

				KAREN
		You make it sound like I'm already 
		dead.

	Blade just stares at her. Finally, she pulls away.

	EXT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DUSK

	CLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the
	sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - DUSK

	Windy. Urban desolation. Blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling
	cardboard and plywood squatter's ghetto which has sprung up around
	the city dump. CHILDREN and DOGS forage for salvageable items, while
	in the distance, dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse.

	MOMENTS LATER,

	Blade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and
	ashcan fires. A CROWD quickly closes in around him, suspicious. A
	BRUTISH MAN steps forward, challenging him --

				MAN
		Extranjero. ¿Quien es?

				BLADE
		I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.

	The man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated
	debate, a GAUNT WOMAN steps forward, motioning --

				WOMAN
		This way.

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Whistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood
	smear slide through a microscope. 

				KAREN
		All right, let's start with the basics 
		-- why do vampires need to drink 
		blood?

				WHISTLER
		Their own blood can't sustain 
		hemoglobin. 

				KAREN
		Then vampirism is a genetic defect, 
		just like Hemolytic anemia?

	Whistler nods.

				KAREN
		So what about gene therapy?

	Whistler looks intrigued. Karen continues.

				KAREN
		Basically you'd have to re-write the 
		victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA 
		will produce proteins capable of 
		generating hemoglobin. 

				WHISTLER
		How?

				KAREN
		With a retrovirus. It's injected into 
		the bone marrow cells, it causes the 
		host's DNA to mutate. They've been 
		using them to treat Sickle-cell 
		anemia. 

	Whistler can hardly believe what he's hearing.

				WHISTLER
		You're serious? You actually think 
		this could work?

	Karen pauses -- we can see in her expression that there's something
	she's been holding back.

				KAREN
		On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so 
		sure -- 
			(gravely)
		The problem is, Blade didn't contract 
		the vampire virus from a bite like I 
		did. He was born with it. The irony 
		is, I could probably cure every 
		vampire but him.

				WHISTLER
		Then we're back to square one, aren't 
		we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always 
		wins.

	At that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out.
	Karen looks around the room, alarmed. 

				KAREN
		What happened to the power?

				WHISTLER
			(concerned)
		I don't know, but the back-up 
		generator should've kicked in.

	A few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated.
	Whistler moves to the window --

				WHISTLER
		UV floodlights are down too.

	As Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS
	SHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines
	the flashlight in that direction. We hear more sounds now -- water
	draining, glass tinkling.

	Whistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges
	towards the black-out curtains, Karen falling in behind him.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - TANK ROOM - NIGHT

	Whistler and Karen enter, cautious --

	THE TANK

	containing the vampire child has been smashed open. It's empty now,
	with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a
	widening pool -- and a trail of tiny BLOODY FOOTPRINTS leading back
	out into the main workshop.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Karen scans the shadows, eyes alert. We hear a WHISPER, then a
	teasing, childish, GIGGLE.

	Whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over
	every inch of the room. And just as he's about to complete his
	circuit --

	THE CHILD

	leaps from where it had been hiding overhead! Karen SCREAMS.
	Whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his
	hand --

	The feral child lands atop Whistler, HISSING like a cobra. Its
	macrocephalic head seems to morph, twisting into grotesque
	proportions. And just as it's about to strike --

	ZZZZING! Whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden
	inside his cane. He lunges forward --

	WHOOSH! The child takes off like a blue streak, sending test tubes
	and medical equipment CRASHING to the floor. It zips past Karen --

				WHISTLER
		Get it!!!

	Karen snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as Whistler
	struggles to his feet --

	Karen sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses
	of the child as it darts through the workshop. She reaches a shelving
	unit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified
	pistols --

	Karen tries to draw a bead on the creature. She FIRES, misses, FIRES
	again -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the
	creature is moving closer and --

	-- suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs
	bared! 

	The child knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat,
	sinking its claws into her neck. Karen chokes, forcing Whistler's
	pistol under the monstrosity's chin --

	-- but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific
	little cherubim of a child -- and Karen hesitates, because the child
	seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and
	hypnotic and --

	-- suddenly Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire
	child's head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature
	slumps --

	Karen cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it
	continues to writhe --

	THUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally
	decapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded.

				WHISTLER
		Understand this -- they are monsters. 
		Hesitate for even a moment, and you've 
		lost.

				FROST (O.S.)
		Words to live by, Whistler.

	Whistler spins, eyes wide. He knows that voice.

	DEACON FROST

	steps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight,
	followed by Mercury and Quinn. 

				FROST
		It's been a long time, hasn't it, "old 
		friend"? 

	EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - MIRACIA'S CABIN - NIGHT

	Blade is led to a plywood cabin crowded with candle-lit altars --
	garish pictures of Saints and demons abound, alongside bottles of
	roots and herbs steeped in alcohol, human bones, voodoo dolls. 

	MIRACIA 

	sits on a sagging couch outside, clutching a deck of well-thumbed
	Bicycle playing cards. She's ancient, with a mouthful of gold-capped
	teeth and cataract-clouded eyes. Blind.

				MIRACIA
		Is something wrong, my friend?

				BLADE
		You're blind --

				MIRACIA
		There are other ways to see. Sit.

	Blade approaches, uneasy. Miracia deals out the playing cards on a
	rickety table, setting them in nine piles which take on a cross
	formation. 

				MIRACIA
		Perhaps you have brought me something 
		-- an offering for the orishas?

	Blade tosses a handful of bills on the table. Miracia nods, then
	flips over the first card in the center pile -- a one-eyed Jack. She
	sighs, grave --

				MIRACIA
		Hold out your hands.

				BLADE
		I didn't come here to get my palms 
		read. I need something translated.

				MIRACIA
		Show me.

	Blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the
	table. Miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper, touching
	her fingertips to her lips.

				MIRACIA
		Sangre. Written in blood. 

	She runs her hands over each line as if it were written in Braille.
	Some of the candles gutter, then extinguish themselves as the wind
	around them rises.

				MIRACIA
		This is an old tongue, from an old 
		world. It concerns LaMagra.

				BLADE
		Who is LaMagra?

				MIRACIA
		The vampire God. This speaks of His 
		return.

	Miracia's fingers search the parchment again.

				MIRACIA
		"-- there will come a Day Walker."
			(reading)
		"His blood will call the Sleeper from 
		beyond the Veil of Tears."

	Blade stares at Miracia, shaken.

				BLADE
		His blood -- ?

	The old woman nods, reaching for a smoldering cigarette.

				MIRACIA
		The Day Walker's blood is a disparador 
		-- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's 
		return. One need only consume it and 
		the spirit of his ancestors will 
		settle upon him.
			(reading)
		"And the Sleeper will rise from the 
		shadows anew, cleansing the world in a 
		Tide of Blood."

				BLADE
			(recalling the phrase)
		"The Blood Tide".

				MIRACIA
			(nodding)
		Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is 
		said that all who feel its taint will 
		succumb to the Thirst. 

				BLADE
		How do I stop it?

	Miracia shrugs, spreading her hands.

				MIRACIA
		The Great Wheel turns, my friend. The 
		Dark is rising. How would you fight a 
		shadow? 

	Miracia sits back, slumping into her chair. The candles have burnt
	themselves down to nothing. 

				MIRACIA
		I am tired. Dawn is coming. 

				BLADE
		But I just got here --

				MIRACIA
		You've been here longer than you 
		think. 

	Blade rises, looking to the horizon. Incredibly, dawn is coming. As
	he stands there, mystified, the wind picks up, sweeping the parchment
	fragment out of his hand. He tries to snatch it back, but the
	fragment is quickly borne away. He watches it disappear into the sky,
	then turns back --

	Miracia is gone. Blade glances around him, but she's nowhere to be
	found. 

	CAMERA PULLS BACK,

	isolating Blade amidst the ghostly squalor. From our vantage point,
	he looks like any other homeless phantom.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

	Blade steps out from the elevator into the workshop --

	The place has been trashed. It looks like a tornado touched down in
	his absence. Blade pulls out one of his .454s, cautious --

				BLADE
		WHISTLER?!

	-- and then he stops dead in his tracks.

	WHISTLER

	has been strung up by his arms against the far wall, tortured and
	left for dead. In response to Blade's voice, a MOAN escapes the dying
	man's lips.

	Blade rushes to the wall, cutting Whistler down with his sword,
	gently lowering him to the floor. As he cradles the old man in his
	arms, Blade sees the primary wound -- two ragged puncture marks along
	Whistler's throat.

				BLADE
		Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to 
		you?

	Whistler opens his eyes, struggling to speak --

				WHISTLER
		Frost took her --

	Whistler spasms and coughs, wincing from the pain.

				BLADE
		Don't try to talk --

				WHISTLER
		Listen. You have to -- finish me off. 
		You don't want me coming back.

				BLADE
		No, we can treat the wounds --

	But Whistler is shaking his hand.

				WHISTLER
		Too far gone, you know that.

	Blade's at a complete loss.

				BLADE
		Whistler, I can't.

	Whistler clutches at Blade's arm, his eyes burning with conviction.

				WHISTLER
		Yes you can. Now get on with it. 

	As much as he'd like to deny it, Blade knows that Whistler is right.
	He pulls a stake from his bandoleer, hesitates.

				BLADE
		Whistler, I --

				WHISTLER
			(cutting him off, more gentle now)
		I know. 
			(forcing a smile)
		Just be quick about it, will you? Do 
		it right.

	Blade fights back tears. With a wretched moan, he turns his head and
	drives the stake into Whistler's chest. Whistler GASPS. Blade wraps
	his arms around the older man, holding him tight as the life runs out
	of him, rocking back and forth --

	After a while, the rocking stops and Blade lays Whistler on the
	floor. Then something catches his eye --

	A SHARP VIEW-CAMCORDER

	resting nearby, labeled, "PLAY ME". Blade reaches for the camcorder,
	cues the tape -- Frost's face appears on the tiny built-in screen.

				FROST
		Hello, Blade. By the time you watch 
		this, Whistler will no doubt be 
		winging his way to Heaven, thanks to 
		your capable hands. If it makes any 
		difference to you, he put up quite a 
		fight.

	Frost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek.

				FROST
		Now, I'm sure you're wondering about 
		Ms. Jansen's well-being. She's alive 
		and kicking -- "ambulatory", as they 
		like to say in the trade. Whether or 
		not she remains so is entirely up to 
		you.
			(beat)
		I'll make this as easy as possible for 
		you, Blade. You can find us at the 
		Edgewood Towers. We'll be waiting with 
		baited breath.

	The tape cuts to static. Blade throws the camcorder against the wall.
	It shatters into a dozen pieces.

	Blade turns now, his eyes falling on the medical equipment Karen
	brought from the hospital. He moves to the refrigerator, removing a
	canister labeled "SODIUM CITRATE". Then he draws his sword. We can
	practically see the wheels turning within his mind --

	MOMENTS LATER,

	Blade stands before the open flames of one of the furnaces, heating
	his sword in the fire. He withdraws it -- it's molten red.

	Blade turns, dousing the molten hot sword into the sodium citrate
	canister. The refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat, causing the
	sword to STEAM and HISS.

	When Blade withdraws the smoking sword, we SEE that the gleaming
	steel has changed colors, taking on a bluish tinge, just like the
	sodium citrate it was immersed in. Blade smiles to himself,
	satisfied.

	CUT TO:

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, INNER CHAMBER - DAY

	Sparse decor in a Neo-Japanese vein. Minimalist lighting. The walls
	are glass. Recirculating pumps send a constant stream of water
	cascading down them.

	Karen is escorted into the room by Mercury. She gestures to a chair
	at the end of a long table. Karen sits. 

	FROST 

	leans forward out of the shadows, resting his elbows on the table,
	hands steepled together. 

				FROST
		Well, here we are, Doctor.

	A cigarette appears in Frost's hand. In the blink of an eye, the
	cigarette is lit, burning. The movements are so quick we barely have
	time to register them. 

				KAREN
		Why haven't you killed me yet? 

				MERCURY
		Deacon likes to play with his food 
		before he eats it.

	Frost laughs. Karen tries to keep calm. The longer she keeps them
	talking, the longer she remains alive.

				KAREN
		How many of you are there?

				FROST
		A few thousand scattered about the 
		globe. In the past, we've had to 
		restrict our numbers for fear of 
		discovery. That won't be necessary 
		after tonight. 

				KAREN
		What happens then?

				FROST
		The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied 
		holy war against the humans. There's a 
		force, you see -- a spirit that exists 
		in our blood. I've discovered a way to 
		invoke it.

				KAREN
		LaMagra --

				FROST
		That's right. The answers were there 
		all along, of course, scribbled down 
		in the forgotten languages of my kind. 
		Waiting for someone with the patience 
		to decipher them. 
		My elders were foolish enough to 
		dismiss them as wives tales. But I 
		knew better. 
			(beat)
		Imagine my surprise when Blade turned 
		out to be the key which would set that 
		force free. 

	Frost sits forward now, impassioned.

				FROST
		LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a 
		spirit, requiring a flesh and blood 
		host in order to manifest himself.

				KAREN
		You.

				FROST
		Who better to usher in the Blood Tide? 

	Karen shakes her head, protesting --

				KAREN
		There's no need for any of this. Your 
		condition can be treated. Whistler and 
		I were working on a cure when --

				FROST
		What makes you think we want to be 
		cured? Blood is only part of the 
		equation. The hunt, the killing, 
		that's what the Thirst is really 
		about.

				KAREN
		But you use blood banks --

				FROST
		Only as a last resort. Preserved blood 
		is inferior. There's no flavor left to 
		it, no life. 
			(rising from his seat)
		Fortunately, I've found a way around 
		that particular obstacle. 

	Frost moves to the end of the room. He pushes a button. With a HUM
	the wall slides open, revealing something Karen wishes she'd never
	seen -- living blood banks.

	THREE SEDATED HUMANS

	have been hooked up to IV feeds which replenish various nutrients as
	their blood is drained from them. Shunts have been implanted in their
	forearms which serve as taps. 

				FROST
		Under these conditions I can keep a 
		donor alive for years, producing 
		anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints 
		of blood.
			(admiring his charges)
		Of course, this is just a pilot 
		program, really. Once the Tide comes, 
		we'll need to expand production. So 
		many more mouths to feed -- 

	Karen turns away, overwhelmed by revulsion. 

				KAREN
		You're a monster.

				FROST
		Why? Because we live at another 
		species' expense? Your people farm 
		cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening 
		them up with steroids? It's called 
		evolution, Doctor. Survival of the 
		fittest. 

	Frost stares at Karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze. 

				FROST
		I have a wake-up call for the human 
		race. You're no longer at the top of 
		the food chain.

	EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - DAY

	BLADE'S POV

	A telephoto view of Frost's penthouse. The windows are polarized,
	blocking out the sun's harsh rays.

	Blade lowers a pair of binoculars. He's standing on the roof of a
	building across the street. He hefts an air-launcher rifle up into
	firing position --

	BANG! An iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air
	between the two buildings, sinking into the concrete facade of
	Frost's penthouse. Blade secures his end of the rope. He slips a
	pulley over the rope, grabs hold of two handles, and leaps off the
	roof ledge!

	WHOOSH! Blade slides towards Frost's penthouse, a good twenty stories
	above street level. A second before he reaches the windows, Blade
	lets go. Momentum sends him CRASHING through in a shower of glass.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	An ALARM is ringing. Sunlight streams in through the broken window.
	TWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light
	are burning up before our eyes. Blade climbs to his feet --

	A THIRD VAMPIRE

	leaps at him. Blade spins, flipping the vampire over his shoulder,
	sending him straight through one of the other windows --

	EXT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	The vampire tumbles earthward, SCREAMING as the sun's rays ignite his
	body, falling like a human comet.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	Blade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall --

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY

	To Blade's right is the inner chamber with the "waterfall" walls. As
	ANOTHER VAMPIRE approaches, Blade readies his sword --

				VAMPIRE
		You think I'm afraid of that toothpick 
		of yours?

				BLADE
		You should be. I've made some 
		improvements.

	And with that, Blade thrusts his blackened sword forward, right
	through the vampire's chest. 

	The creature SHRIEKS and atomizes -FWOOSH!- flying apart in a fine-
	beaded spray of blood mist. 

	Up ahead are a set of steel doors with a time-lock mechanism. Blade
	draws a Casull, BLASTS away at the lock, then shoulders the doors
	open --

	INT. FROST'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - DAY

	We are in a windowless, vault-like room dominated by a series of
	high-tech STAINLESS STEEL SARCOPHAGI. Think of a hyperbaric coffin, 
	each unit possessing a small face-plate window through which the 
	sleeping subject can be viewed.

	Blade unsheathes his sword. He grabs the lid of the first
	sarcophagus, HEAVING upward. With a PNEUMATIC HISS, the lid rises,
	belching out a cloud of condensation mist. 

	As the mist clears, revealing the occupant within, Blade raises his
	sword, ready to plunge it downward -- only it's not Deacon Frost who
	rests beneath him, it's --

	VANESSA,

	Blade's mother!!! Although some thirty years have passed since the
	events of our prologue, Vanessa looks exactly the same -- vibrant,
	beautiful, full of life. Her eyes open.

				VANESSA
		Jason. 

	Blade gasps, uncomprehending.

				BLADE
		Mother -- ?!

	Vanessa rises from the sarcophagus, tears staining her cheeks.

				VANESSA
		I've missed you so much, Jason. 
			(drawing closer)
		You have no idea what I've been 
		through, how much I've wanted to see 
		you -- 

	Blade falters, his mind reeling. What he's seeing is incomprehensible
	-- his mother is dead. Yet, here she is in the flesh, reaching out to
	him and --

	-- flashing a mouthful of viper-like fangs! She SNARLS and strikes,
	brutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword
	from his grasp --

	A TRIO OF BLACK-CLAD VAMPIRES

	led by Mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all
	along. They're armed with tasers which they fire en masse --

	Blade is hit by the taser darts from all sides. He writhes as
	electricity courses through him, then collapses in a heap. He labors
	to lift his head, looking up at Vanessa -- 

				BLADE
		But you -- died --

				VANESSA
			(a hellish smile)
		Deacon brought me back. 

				BLADE
		Fight him --

	As if on cue, Frost appears at Vanessa's side, wrapping a proprietary
	arm about her waist, kissing the nape of her neck. She leans into him
	-- an act of practiced intimacy.

				FROST
		She can't. She's one of my thralls 
		now. She has about as much free will 
		as a puppet on a string.
			(looking at Vanessa)
		You love me, don't you, Vanessa? 

				VANESSA
		Yes.

	Frost kisses Vanessa hungrily. Then he kneels and reaches into
	Blade's jacket, retrieving a vial of Blade's serum.

				FROST
		What do we have here? Your precious 
		serum? I don't think you'll be needing 
		this anymore.

	Frost crushes the vial in his fist. Blade struggles to reach Frost,
	stretching a palsied hand upwards --

				BLADE
		Please -- 

				VANESSA
		Listen to your father, Jason. It's 
		going to be a better world.

	Blade stares at Vanessa uncomprehending. 

				FROST
		Don't look so surprised, Blade. You've 
		spent your life looking for the 
		vampire who fathered you. Well you can 
		rest easy now, you've found him.
			(gripping Blade's chin)
		Daddy's here.

	Blade's eyes widen in shock. Frost simply laughs.

				FROST
		It's true, Blade. You've got my blood 
		running through your veins.
			(smiling)
		Thirty years ago. A moonlit street, a 
		woman on her way home alone. You were 
		conceived the night I tore my fangs 
		into your mother's flesh. 

	Frost swings his fist into Blade's skull. Everything goes black. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

	FADE IN as Blade opens his eyes, still groggy, his face beaded with
	sweat. Feverish. His hands have been bound tightly behind his back
	with manacles and chains. 

	KAREN

	sits nearby, watching him. From the steady rocking motion and the
	SOUNDS of traffic outside, it's evident that they are in the back of
	a moving truck.

				KAREN
		Are you all right?

				BLADE
			(weakly)
		I've been better --

				BLADE
		How long have we been driving?

				KAREN
			(shaking her head)
		I don't know. I woke up just before 
		you did --

	As he struggles to sit up, she crosses over to him. Blade shuts his
	eyes for a moment, fighting a wave of pain.

				KAREN
		Is it bad?

				BLADE
			(nodding)
		We get out of this alive, maybe I'll 
		take that miracle cure of yours.

	Karen doesn't respond. Instead she looks away. How in the world is
	she supposed to tell him this?

				KAREN
			(quietly)
		It won't work on you.

				BLADE
		What are you talking about?

	Karen forces herself to meet his gaze.

				KAREN
		Your condition's congenital, the 
		genetic mutations occurred in utero. 
		All the other victims contracted 
		vampirism after birth. 

	Blade stares at Karen, disbelieving. Who could imagine a more
	horrifying irony? She's crying now. She can't help it.

				KAREN
		I can't cure you, Blade. I can cure 
		myself, but I can't cure you.
			(beat)
		I'm so sorry.

	Blade's head sinks, the last vestiges of hope draining out of him.

	And then, as if the final stake were being pounded in, the truck
	lurches to a stop. We hear the ENGINE being killed, then FOOTSTEPS
	approaching, and then a series of BOLTS BEING SHIFTED as --

	-- the back of the truck is thrown open. Frost stands there,
	grinning, flanked by Mercury, Quinn, Vanessa, and a half-dozen other
	VAMPIRE ASSOCIATES. 

				FROST
		Welcome home, children.

	EXT. THE BANK OF EREBUS - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen are dragged from the back of the truck, which is
	revealed now to be an armored car. 

	THE BANK OF EREBUS

	rises up before them. A towering beaux-arts edifice situated in the
	heart of the city's high-priced financial district -- one of the many
	institutions owned and operated by the vampire enclave.

	Frost starts up the marble steps towards a grand, triple-arched
	entrance flanked by Corinthian columns. Karen and Blade are dragged
	along after him. 

	INT. BANK OF EREBUS - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	Frost leads his vampires into a high-ceilinged atrium, moving towards
	a bank of elevators -- one of the doors of which is outfitted with a
	high-tech hand-key ID system.

	Frost places his palm on the ID screen. The screen GLOWS GREEN,
	acknowledging his identity. In response, the doors HISS open.

	INT. SECURITY ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen are pulled inside the elevator. The control panel
	buttons have vampire glyphs, rather than numbers. Frost presses the
	bottom one. The doors close with a WHOOSH and the car descends --
	down, down, down.

	Frost glances over at Karen, smiling amiably.

				FROST
		On its surface, this building houses 
		one of the city's oldest financial 
		institutions -- and for over 
		two-hundred years its served our 
		corporate needs. Look beneath the 
		surface, however, and you'll discover 
		another truth entirely --

	The elevator CHIMES, having arrived at its destination. The doors
	HISS open, revealing 

	INT. THE TEMPLE OF NIGHT 

	A vast, barrel-vaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches
	out before us -- an underground cathedral of sorts, wrought from
	alabaster and marble. Restrained. Elegant. Replete with dark
	splendor.

				FROST
		As above, so below.

	Torches burn in wall sconces, casting everything in a warm, amber
	glow. Frost takes in the beauty of the place.

				FROST
		Welcome to our hall of ancients, 
		Doctor. We call it the Temple of 
		Night.

	Blade and Karen are led to the middle of the room, where a stone
	altar rises up from a dais. Blade is roughly thrown to the ground. He
	kneels there, eyes cast downward. Broken. His system being assaulted
	by the devastating effects of the Thirst. 

	Quinn and Mercury pick their way through Blade's discarded gear.
	Quinn picks up the punching dagger, admiring it. 

	Frost turns to Mercury, who's been holding Blade's scabbarded sword.

				FROST
		Let's see this sword of his.

	Mercury draws the sword, handing it to Frost. He sights down the
	length of it, testing its weight. With a flick of his wrist, he
	lashes out, slashing Blade's cheek open. 

				FROST
		Still quite sharp, I see.

	Blade feebly struggles to rise. Frost clubs him on the back of the
	neck with the sword pommel. Blade crumples. Karen tries to pull free,
	but Quinn holds her tight.

				KAREN
		Blade --

				FROST
		You're wasting your breath, woman. He 
		can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, 
		you see? It already has him in its 
		grip.

	Frost reaches down, dragging Blade's head up by his hair. Karen
	watches on as Frost continues to taunt him.

				FROST
		How long has it been since you had 
		your serum? Twelve hours? More? You 
		must be quite thirsty by now.

	He crouches down so he's eye to eye with Blade.

				FROST
		What does it feel like? Is your blood 
		on fire? Are you burning up inside? 
		Give in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace 
		your true nature.

	Blade shivers, grits his teeth, it's like he's going through heroin
	withdrawal. 

				BLADE
		-- go to hell --

	Frost smiles, his eyes burning with an infernal glow.

				FROST
		I've got news for you, Blade. We're 
		already here.

	Frost turns to the others, motioning.

				FROST
		Take him to the sanctuary. It's time 
		he was bled.

	The other vampires retreat, dragging Blade along with them. Karen is
	left alone with Frost and Quinn.

				FROST
		I'd let you watch the proceedings, 
		Doctor, but I'm afraid that privilege 
		is reserved for members of my own 
		race. Don't worry, though, I've made 
		alternate arrangements for you.

	Frost motions and Quinn drags Karen towards --

	THE MOUTH OF A PIT

	some forty feet deep, its lichen-encrusted stone walls worn smooth
	over time. As Frost gestures to the yawning darkness beneath them,
	Quinn forces Karen towards the edge. 

				FROST
		We call this the Bone Pit. It's where 
		we keep our mistakes, the ones who 
		couldn't successfully make the 
		transition from human to vampire. 

	Frost reaches out, caressing Karen's neck, puncturing the soft flesh
	beneath her chin with a razored fingernail.

				FROST
		They'll feed on anything, given the 
		chance -- animals, corpses, even other 
		vampires.

	Frost nods. Karen struggles against Quinn, but it's no good. In a
	manner of seconds, she's falling --

	INT. BONE PIT - NIGHT

	-- making a decidedly rough landing on a heap of bones far below. She
	GROANS, taking stock of her battered body.

	UP ABOVE,

	Deacon watches from the lip of the pit, amused. 

				FROST
		Of course, a strapping young woman 
		like yourself -- well I think you just 
		might be considered finger food.

	And with that, he's gone, stepping away from the pit.

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

	We are in a small, elevated antechamber which is situated above the
	main vampire sanctuary.

	BLADE, 

	now weakened to the point of collapse, is being lashed to a rack-like
	device by iron chains. 

	Mercury and her cohorts move efficiently, quickly securing him. When
	they are through, the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of
	winch-driven chains. 

	With every turn of the winch crank, the chains are drawn tighter,
	causing Blade to CRY OUT, until at last, he is suspended in mid-air,
	spread-eagle. 

	FROST

	approaches, still carrying Blade's sword.

				FROST
		It's been a long road, hasn't it? Such 
		a pity Whistler led you so far astray. 

	Frost cocks his head to the side, studying Blade's face.

				FROST
		I don't blame you, though. I want you 
		to know that. Even after all you've 
		done. I understand, Blade, I really 
		do. It's the human side of you which 
		has corrupted your reasoning, made you 
		weak. But we'll take care of that, 
		won't we?

	Blade struggles to lift his head, forcing himself to match Frost's
	gaze, shaking with hatred.

				BLADE
		I'd kill myself -- before I turned 
		into something like you.

	Frost just smiles and shakes his head.

				FROST
		No you wouldn't. I'm going to bleed 
		you dry, Blade. All the poison that 
		makes you human. 
			(drawing closer)
		When the Tide comes, you'll be begging 
		me put you through the Change. 

	Frost lifts up Blade's sword, methodically slitting Blade's wrists
	one by one. He makes the cuts lengthwise, opening up the cephalic and
	basilic veins with surgical precision.

	Blood wells up from the fresh wounds, running down Blade's forearms,
	collecting in a cistern beneath his feet. 

	Frost watches the steady, inexorable process, then nods, satisfied.
	He looks to the others who are gathered behind him, watching on with
	silent reverence.

				FROST
		It's done. We should ready ourselves 
		for the ritual of invocation.

	Frost leads Mercury, Quinn, and the others from the sanctuary.

	Blade struggles futilely against his bonds, crying out in
	frustration, his body eventually sagging from exhaustion. 

				VANESSA (O.S.)
		There's no use fighting us, Jason. 

	Blade looks up, focusing now on --

	VANESSA, 

	who has remained behind. Blade stares at her. As terrible as his
	physical torment is, his mother's betrayal is infinitely worse.

				BLADE
		How could you be a part of this?

				VANESSA
		These are my people now. I'm one of 
		them.

				BLADE
		You don't have to be. 

				VANESSA
		You don't understand. I've killed, 
		I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it. 

	She draws closer, caressing her son's face. There's just a hint of
	creepy eroticism in her action, a dash of incest. 

				VANESSA
		I wish you could see the world as I 
		do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no 
		turning back from that.

				BLADE
		I don't believe that.

				VANESSA
		You will. Time is on our side. Sooner 
		or later, the Thirst always wins.

	Vanessa turns away now. Blade cries after her --

				BLADE
		Mother!

	Vanessa pauses, looking back, smiling cruelly.

				VANESSA
		Your mother died the night you
		were born. 

	And with that, she's gone, melting into the shadows. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE BONE PIT - NIGHT 

	Karen rises, wary, taking in her shadowed surroundings. 

	HEAPS OF HUMAN BONES

	are piled against the pit walls -- skulls, rib-cages, femurs, tibias
	-- all picked clean of flesh. Some of the skulls have large, canine-
	like fangs -- the remnants, no doubt, of long-deceased vampires.

	Suddenly we hear a WHISPER of sorts, the soft CLINKING of bone
	fragments grinding together --

	Karen spins, trying to place the source of the sound. Then she hears
	the SOUND again. Behind her now, closer.

				REVENANT (O.S.)
		Karennnnn --

	Karen looks up with a growing sense of dread.

	A FACE

	emerges from the darkness. Pallid, cadaverous, shedding its
	desiccated flesh. Lidless eyes like black marbles slick with
	Vaseline. A mouth like a raw wound. 

				REVENANT
		Karreennnnnn. I never thought I'd see 
		you againnnnn.

	Karen backs away, realizing who she's standing before.

				KAREN
		Curtis?!

	What used to be Curtis SNARLS, knocking Karen back into the drift-
	pile of bones. It pins her to the ground, kneeling above her,
	gurgling through its gutted trachea.

				CURTIS REVENANT
		Tell, me, Karennn -- ever have second 
		thoughts -- about us?

	Karen SCREAMS, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it
	lunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a
	pathetic approximation of a French kiss.

	She fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur,
	blindly swinging it upward --

	CRACK! The blow shatters the Curtis-thing's jaw. It rears back,
	falling to the side. 

	Karen crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and
	again --

	CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it
	back until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head
	hangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it
	advances, dragging itself back up.

	Sobbing, Karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a
	makeshift dagger.

	Curtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. At the last moment,
	Karen ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into Curtis' chest --

	Curtis impales himself, right through the heart. For one split-
	second, his eyes widen in surprise --

	-- and then he goes into a death-spasm, vomiting up a spray of
	caustic vampire blood-bile, spattering Karen. She sinks to her knees,
	GASPING, as the thing that used to be Curtis shrivels up, melting
	away into burbling puddle.

	After a beat, Karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her
	hands over the lichen-slick surface, searching for a way out. The
	mortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling. 

	Karen looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs.
	She pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds,
	working as a makeshift piton.

	Karen reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the
	first. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two
	makeshift pitons. Again, they hold.

	Trembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging
	solely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she
	manages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another
	foot above the left.

	In this slow, torturous manner, Karen begins to climb her way up out
	of the pit.

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade hangs from his chains, head slack, eyes half-lidded and
	lusterless. His skin has grown ashen as his life's blood has been
	bled away.

	Mercury appears before him, accompanied by Quinn. She bends in close
	to kiss Blade lightly on the lips.

				MERCURY
		It won't be long now, lover. 

	Quinn draws alongside her, hefting Blade's punching dagger. He places
	it against Blade's throat, slowly applying pressure. At this point,
	Blade's too weak to even resist.

				QUINN
		We should finish him off.

				MERCURY
			(shaking her head)
		No. Deacon wants him turned.

	Quinn releases Blade, disgusted. 

				QUINN
		Fucking waste, if you ask me.

	As Mercury and Quinn exit, the CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the cistern
	beneath Blade's feet. We follow the blood which has collected there
	as it flows into a crude drain and --

	INT. SANCTUARY - NIGHT 

	-- emerges from the ceiling of the sanctuary below. The stream of
	blood is directed down the channels of a spiral column, where it
	finally pools into a waiting chalice.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	the sanctuary in full. A large circular chamber, the perimeter of
	which is lined with recessed alcoves housing the remains of the
	vampire ancients, set into the sanctuary walls like cells in a hive.

	DEACON FROST

	stands in the center of the chamber, allowing Vanessa to clothe him
	in ceremonial regalia -- gleaming, centuries-old armor. He pauses,
	kissing her hungrily.

	Having finished suiting up, he turns to face the vampires who have
	been faithful to his cause -- Mercury, Quinn, a host of others. A
	hush settles upon them. There's an excitement in the air, a sense
	that something remarkable is about to happen.

				FROST
		Tonight is the night we've waited our 
		entire lives for. Tonight, the 
		blood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the 
		world. Tonight, the Age of Man comes 
		to an end. 

	The vampires bellow out a CHORUS OF CHEERS, their voices resonating
	off the stone walls like thunder. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BONE PIT - NIGHT

	Karen's hands appear over the lip of the bone pit. She heaves herself
	up, collapsing onto the floor --

	-- but there's no time to rest. Even now she can hear the VAMPIRES
	CHEERING. She drags herself to her feet, letting the voices guide
	her.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Karen slips around a corner, guarded, searching. She SEES Blade
	strung up before her, seemingly lifeless.

	Karen studies the chains which bind Blade, following them back to
	their source at the winch. She releases the brake on the winch crank,
	sending the chains RATTLING down through the overhead pulleys which
	suspend them. 

	Blade crumples to the floor, lying still. Karen is at his side in an
	instant --

				KAREN
			(whispering, urgent)
		Blade.

	Blade's eyes flicker open, fixing on her. Inhuman. He's shaking
	like an alcoholic going into delirium tremens.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Vanessa hands Frost the chalice containing Blade's blood. He lifts it
	up for all to see. The vampires begin to chant en masse, some long-
	forgotten invocation in the vampire tongue.

				FROST
			(grinning, to himself)
		"And what rough beast, its hour come 
		round at last, slouches towards 
		Bethlehem to be born?"

	Frost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade tries to sit up, gripping Karen's wrist --

				BLADE
		Get out of here --

				KAREN
		I'm not leaving without you.

				BLADE
		You don't understand. The Thirst --

	He clutches his stomach, experiencing phenomenal pain.

				BLADE
			(gasping)
		-- tearing me -- apart.

				KAREN
		I know. Take some of my blood.

				BLADE
		No --

				KAREN
		It's the only way. You know that. 
		We'll never get out of here alive if 
		you don't.

	Blade suppresses a shudder. Simply keeping himself from attacking her
	takes every ounce of his resolve.

				BLADE
		I can't -- I won't be able to stop --

				KAREN
		Yes you will. The human side of you is 
		stronger. I know it is.

	Karen matches Blade's gaze, steeling herself. The truth is, she's
	terrified. 

	Blade stares back at her. At this moment, he wants what Karen is
	offering more than anything he's ever desired. And so he rises --

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Frost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force
	seizes his body. He throws his head back, eyes rolling to white,
	flinging the chalice aside.

	And as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch, we SEE the
	stone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder --
	as if some force within were trying to break free --

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Karen turns her head to the side, baring her neck, offering herself
	to Blade. Blade opens his mouth. His canines elongate. He lowers his
	head --

	-- and starts to feed. Karen involuntarily stiffens as Blade's teeth
	puncture her skin and we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Frost shakes, possessed by an unseen force. A wind picks up from
	nowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange
	HUMMING. 

	Suddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN. A WRAITH-LIKE SPIRIT rushes
	outward in a fountain of light, penetrating Frost's body.

	Then ANOTHER TOMB SPLITS APART. Then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER -- until a
	torrent of SPIRIT-WRAITHS are surging into Frost, buffeting him about
	like a scarecrow in a cyclone.

	Mercury, Vanessa, and the other vampires back away, apprehensive,
	humbled by what they're witnessing.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade moans, sinking his teeth deeper. Karen's head rolls back. Her
	eyes open -- glassy, unseeing -- as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her. 

	She shudders, her breath quickening, falling into a synchronous
	rhythm with Blade's. Her fingers dig deep into his back, clawing
	downward, tearing into him -- 

	She's not Karen anymore -- she's a red blood cell, an erythrocyte,
	spinning in a river of plasma, roaring up Blade's femoral artery,
	racing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the
	deafening breath of God, which blots all other sounds out of
	existence and we're --

	CUTTING BACK AND FORTH NOW

	between Frost's transformation and Blade's, each of them growing
	stronger by the second, caught in an ever-increasing feedback loop of
	expanding energy until --

				BLADE
		NO!!!!

	Blade tears himself from Karen, his pulse racing as -- 

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	-- the invocation of LaMagra reaches critical mass. Frost is consumed
	by a hellish force, unable to withstand the onslaught of spirit
	energy any longer. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	-- Karen clawing at Blade, tears streaming down her cheeks.

				KAREN
		Don't stop --

	But Blade grips her by her shoulders, shoving her back. Karen stares
	at Blade, wide-eyed, as if waking from a trance. She touches the raw
	wounds on her neck, shaken --

				KAREN
		My God --

	Blade rises to his full height. His strength has more than returned,
	it's been doubled by the infusion of real blood. And there's
	something else in his gaze now too -- an animal fury that was missing
	before. Blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness. 

				KAREN
			(hesitant)
		Are you -- all right?

	Blade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists, SNAPPING them apart
	like toys. He flexes his hands -- fingernails lengthening to tapered
	points. And he smiles, offering us a view of his canines, which have
	elongated into fangs.

				BLADE
			(near-demonic)
		Never been better.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	The aftermath. Smoke hangs heavy in the air, occluding the area where
	Frost had stood. As it dissipates, Mercury and the others creep
	forward, apprehensive --

				MERCURY
		Deacon?

	FROST

	stands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes.
	As he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes -- burning with an
	awesome, inner fire. 

				FROST
		No longer.

				BLADE (O.S.)
		Frost!!!

	All heads turn --

	BLADE 

	stands at the balcony overhead, Karen at his side. He leaps from it,
	somersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a
	predatory cat.

				BLADE
		Who dies first?

				FROST
			(growling, to the others)
		Take him.

	Quinn GROWLS, stepping forward, armed with Blade's punching dagger.
	He offers his second "new hand" up for view. 

				QUINN
		Grew another hand for you sweetmeat --
			(tossing the dagger to his new hand)
		-- and now I'm gonna kill you with it.

	Quinn charges. Blade meets the vampire head-on, dropping into a low
	kick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. He spins
	behind Quinn -- 

				BLADE
		Let's see if you can grow a new one
		of these!

	Blade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket
	sleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle-wire which he twists
	around Quinn's throat. 

	Blade tightens the wire, decapitating Quinn. The headless body
	staggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. Blade scoops up his
	punching dagger --

				BLADE
		Next?

	Mercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. Blade
	launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, SNAPPING
	its neck --

	Mercury has Blade's .454 Casulls. She aims them at him --

				MERCURY
		Have a taste of your own medicine!

	As she FIRES, Blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from
	her hand. The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up
	by --

	KAREN,

	who takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.

	Meanwhile, Blade traps Mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping
	her over his shoulder. He hefts his Casull, BLASTING her into
	eternity --

	A bloodbath ensues. Blade moves like speed-personified, FIRING off
	one, two, THREE HEADSHOTS with brain-numbing accuracy, cutting down
	the vampires where they stand. 

	It's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and
	-CLICK-CA-CHING-CLICK!- Blade and Karen have spent their bullets
	and --

				FROST (O.S.)
		Enough!!!

	Blade turns to face --

	FROST, 

	who's advancing, clutching Blade's own sword in his hand. He thrusts
	the sword forward --

	Blade presses the grip-trigger on his punching dagger -CHING!- the
	two side blades spread out. We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on
	metal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the
	dagger blades --

	For a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together,
	then, Frost forces Blade backwards --

	What happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever
	exposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge
	and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.

	Frost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge
	biting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword
	for another strike --

	-- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm
	off at the shoulder --

	The severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To
	Frost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding
	red, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm-
	stump to re-attach itself!

	Undaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section,
	meeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his
	dagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again.

	Blade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding
	what has happened.

				FROST
		You're too late, Blade. I'm already 
		changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper 
		has awakened. I'm not just Frost 
		anymore. I'm becoming a god now, 
		blood incarnate.

	Even as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph,
	bleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't
	walk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of
	animated blood! A blood demon.

	ON KAREN,

	as she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's
	discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the
	periphery of her vision --

	VANESSA

	rushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in
	an eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning
	her. 

				VANESSA
		Did you think I'd forgotten you, you 
		little whore?

	BACK TO FROST,

	who towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid-
	like form.

				FROST
		You can't hurt me anymore. 

	WHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING
	WITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly --

	-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the
	blink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying
	behind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger --

	Once again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a
	series of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back
	again in a series of split-second transformations.

	Blade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time --

	WHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million
	zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to
	pin-point his foe's next manifestation.

				BLADE
		Where are you?!

	Frost's voice answers from all directions.

				FROST
		Everywhere.

	A DROPLET OF BLOOD

	spatters the floor at Blade's feet. Blade looks up --

	A SHOWER OF BLOOD

	rains from above, coalescing into Frost as he sweeps down on Blade
	like a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor. 

				FROST
		You want my blood so much?! Take it!

	Frost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts
	of blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist
	around Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's
	head in a bubble of blood.

	Blade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he
	could dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!

	BACK TO VANESSA

	as she wraps a hand around Karen's throat, choking her.

	As Karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip
	pocket, digging something out -- Whistler's vampire mace canister!

	She forces it up between them, triggering a jet of TOXIC MIST into
	Vanessa's face --

	Vanessa recoils, HOWLING, her head smoking as if it were doused with
	formic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. Karen lunges for
	Blade's sword --

	BACK TO FROST AND BLADE

	Blade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles
	stream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask
	of insanity.

				FROST
		I was wrong about you, Blade. You were 
		never one of us. You're a traitor to 
		your race. 

				KAREN (O.S.)
		Get away from him!

	Frost looks up -- Karen is wielding Blade's sword. She brings it down
	on Frost, severing the blood-tendrils which envelope Blade. The
	blood-bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from Blade's face. He
	gasps, chokes in air --

	Frost backs away, horrified. His blood-tendrils don't reform.
	Instead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline
	powder.

				KAREN
		Blade!

	Karen flings the sword at Blade. 

	THE SWORD 

	spins end over end, its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating
	pinwheels of candlelight as Blade catches the weapon by its hilt.

	Blade rises, advancing on Frost, sword outstretched and Frost
	retreats, uncertain now.

				BLADE
		Guess you're not quite as invulnerable 
		as you thought.

				FROST
		You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and 
		my transition will be complete. Even 
		your sword won't be able to affect me 
		then.

				BLADE
		You don't have a few minutes, Frost.

	Frost eyes Blade warily, then lunges towards Vanessa, sweeping behind
	her. Blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, Frost
	spins Vanessa around, using her body as a shield!

	Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his
	mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's
	poisonous mace. Piteous, really. 

	Frost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of Blade's to exploit.

				FROST
			(laughing cruelly)
		Just as I thought. Still chained to 
		your mother's breast after all these 
		years.

	In the same instant, Vanessa's features morph, taking on the angelic,
	youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo.

				FROST
			(gloating)
		You're too human, Blade. 

				BLADE
			(steeling himself)
		It's because I'm human that I can do 
		this.

	Frost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for --

	Blade is already LUNGING forward, driving the sword-point through
	Vanessa's chest, on into Frost's heart! It strikes the stone behind
	them, SHATTERING and --

	Frost and Vanessa HOWL AS ONE, their SCREAMS rising to an unendurable
	intensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding
	ball of light and ATOMIZING BLOOD.

	Blade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the
	backlash of occult energy as a near tidal WAVE of blood surges over
	him -- 

	EXT. BANK OF EREBUS - CITY STREET - NIGHT

	Every door and window of the bank is BLOWN OUTWARD from the force of
	the EXPLOSION. While along the street, manhole covers flip from their
	moorings, spinning up into the air like dimes, being buoyed by
	geysers of blood.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Silence, just the steady DRIP-DRIP of liquid draining. The underworld
	temple gleams with a crimson sheen now. 

	ON BLADE 

	as he stirs. He's been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force
	of the blast, soaked to the quick by blood. He rises to his feet,
	retrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon. At his feet -- 

	THE SWORDBLADE 

	lies in pieces. Amidst them, we find the singed remains of the locket
	-- Vanessa's face barely recognizable beneath the grime. Blade stoops
	to pick it up.

				KAREN (O.S.)
		Blade?

	Blade turns. Karen moves to him, searching his eyes. Which side of
	Blade's soul has won out? Human or vampire?

	Then she SEES the tears rimming Blade's eyes, the first he's shed in
	a lifetime. Human. 

	They embrace, holding each other that way for a long, long time. And
	we --

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK OF EREBUS - DAWN

	Blade and Karen stand on the rooftop, watching as dawn slowly creeps
	across the silent city.

				KAREN
		I never imagined I'd be so happy to 
		see the sun rise --
			(turning to him)
		It's over, isn't it?

				BLADE
		For them. But for me --

	He lifts his face towards the rising sun, letting its warmth wash
	over his upturned face.

				BLADE
		I feel like it's finally beginning.

	And on that note we leave them -- TWO FIGURES, silhouetted against
	the new day.

	FADE TO BLACK.

	THE END
BLADE

	Darkness, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. Presentation credits roll as we
	FADE UP ON:

	INT. HOSPITAL, INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT

	It's 1967, the Summer of Love and --

	BOOM! Entry doors swing open as PARAMEDICS wheel in a FEMALE BLEEDER,
	VANESSA (20s, black, nine months pregnant). She's deathly pale,
	spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat -- 

	A SHOCK-TRAUMA TEAM swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an
	artery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her
	arm --

				NURSE #1
			(with stethoscope)
		She's not breathing!

				SENIOR RESIDENT
		Intubate her!

	The RESPIRATORY THERAPIST feeds an endotracheal tube down the woman's
	ruined throat, attaches that to an Amblu bag --

				RESIDENT
		Blood-pressure's forty and falling --

	The woman starts spasming violently. It takes three staff members
	just to hold her down.

				SENIOR RESIDENT
		Jesus, her water's broken --
			(calling for help)
		She's going into uterine contractions --

	CAMERA PUSHES IN on the woman as she bolts upright, SCREAMING to wake
	the dead. We PLUNGE INTO the darkness of her mouth and find
	ourselves --

	INSIDE HER BLOODSTREAM

	The sound of a HEART BEATING, pounding as we whip-snake through --

	CORPUSCLES 

	floating in amber plasma. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and
	eosinophils. 

	The rhythmic expansion of the artery walls, pulsing with each
	successive surge of blood as the HEART BEATS FASTER AND FASTER,
	taking us --

	IN UTERO,

	A CHILD, alive but unborn, shifting in a sea of amniotic fluid,
	surrounded by the white, protective substance known as vernix
	caseosa. The HEARTBEAT races like a locomotive now. The unborn child
	shifts, turns its head towards us --

	-- and opens its eyes.

	CUT TO:

	A SWORDBLADE

	cleaving the darkness, radiant light slicing across gleaming Damascus
	steel. Words acid-etched in the weapon's fine-tempered surface:

	BLADE

	Main credits end.

	EXT. INNER CITY, INDUSTRIAL GHETTO - NIGHT

	A decaying no man's land populated by condemned buildings and HUNGRY
	HOMELESS. Steam rises from manhole covers, drifting across the
	litter- lined streets. Suddenly --

	A black Mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill, ROARING past
	us, stereo system belting out FILTER.

	INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Raquel, a wasp-wasted woman, sits behind the wheel. 20s, rich,
	sickeningly attractive. Hungry eyes. 

	Squirming around in the passenger seat is DENNIS, a model/actor boy-
	toy with a sub-zero IQ and a "fuck me sideways" grin. 

				DENNIS
		So where we going?

				RAQUEL
		It's a surprise. 

				DENNIS
		I likes surprises. 

	Raquel eyeballs Dennis -- "if looks could devour". 

				RAQUEL
		What do you have down there, little 
		man?

				DENNIS
		Heat-seeker.

				RAQUEL
		I'll bet.

	Raquel slides a manicured hand up his thigh, squeezes his groin.
	Dennis MOANS. She pulls her hand away, downshifts.

	EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT

	The 850 threads a narrow alley into a vacant lot, BRAKES hard. Raquel
	and Dennis climb out. She leads him into --

	EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

	Industry never sleeps, and certainly not this grisly facility. Raquel
	leads Dennis around the back of the plant, where a host of WORKERS
	are loading refrigerated trucks with product.

				DENNIS
		What the fuck are we doing here?

	Raquel just smiles, heads on into the plant via a loading door. The
	workers ignore her.

	INT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

	Dennis follows Raquel through the bowels of the plant, catching
	glimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart. 

	Through one partially open door we see what might be a line of
	BODYBAGS being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain
	pulley-system. But Dennis doesn't have enough time to be disturbed by
	the vision, because he's being pulled away by Raquel, led down --

	A STAIRWELL

	We are in the basement now. At the end of the hall is a steel door,
	with perhaps, just the faintest HINT OF MUSIC heard coming from
	beyond. Raquel knocks.

	A "peep-hole" slat opens and a BLACK LIGHT shines into Raquel's eyes.
	A VOICE behind the door offers a verbal challenge, speaking a
	language we've never heard, laced with a devilish cadence. 

	Raquel responds in kind. The door opens. Raquel gives Dennis a
	knowing wink, enters. Dennis follows. 

	INT. CLUB - NIGHT

	Raquel and Dennis move past a hulking DOORMAN, making their way down
	a narrow stairway. Dennis is suitably impressed.

	THE CLUB 

	is elite, underground -- an "abattoir-chic" version of an old-time
	juke joint with a greasy, dangerous vibe. White-tiled walls and
	floors for easy hosing, chromed fittings, run-off gutters, drains. No
	bar.

	BODIES 

	writhe on the strobe-lit dance floor. A heavy S&M scene. Leather.
	Latex. Tattoos. Body-piercings.

	A D.J. wearing head-mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on
	twin- decks. MUSIC assaults us -- a beat so heavy it could jar the
	fillings from your teeth. Brutal "DARKCORE" along the lines of
	Prodigy or Underground. 

	Raquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway. 

	A lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running
	through her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against
	him. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCURY.

	Mercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced
	with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across
	her back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex. 

	Dennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of
	them dry-humping their way to every man's glory. 

	The beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more
	narcotic. People are stripping off their clothes, sweating like
	fiends. It's a virtual orgy.

	Dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever
	pitch --

				DENNIS
			(over the music)
		Fuck, I need a drink!!!

	Raquel just smiles -- then Dennis notices a DROP OF SOMETHING spatter
	his hand. It looks like blood. Dennis looks up, concerned --

	-- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling. Raquel's face is sprinkled with
	them now. Dennis stops dancing. What is this? Some kind of fucked up
	performance art?

	Raquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a
	summer shower, now the other club goers are looking up too --

	BLOOD SHOWERS DOWN

	from sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. The club
	goers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to
	receive the crimson offering. 

	Horrified, Dennis recoils, turning towards --

	RAQUEL,

	whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl. Her canines extend,
	tapering to razor-sharp points. Her tongue flicks, lizard-like as
	fingernails sharpen into claws. All this while the whites of her eyes
	BLEED RED, pupils oscillating hypnotically. 

				RAQUEL
		What's wrong, baby?

	Dennis SCREAMS, pushes away from Raquel, only --

	-- Mercury has fangs now too. In fact, everyone in the club does,
	with the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're all
	vampires.

	Dennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally
	smashing his fist into Dennis' face. 

	Dennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a
	game of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces
	leering like twisted jack-o-lanterns.

	The strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis
	spins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis
	lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up.
	A DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The
	figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- 

	A BLACK MAN, 

	towers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a
	sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of
	horror. His name is BLADE.

	Blade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an
	arsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body: 

	6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with
	an ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a "Demon"
	automatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style
	katar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his
	namesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard.

	CLOSE ON BLADE

	A gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers
	stare back. Nuclear silence. And then --

	All hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving
	at superhuman speed, practically a blur -- 

	Blade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions --

	MACRO BULLET SHOT 

	as a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum-
	dum bullet which explodes on contact.

	WHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest,
	continuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both
	creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of
	black oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains.

	Blade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He
	holsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on
	the UV entry light mounted above --

	MERCURY 

	leaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything
	move so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into
	the night just as --

	-- a shaft of blinding UV "sunlight" cuts across the vampires. They
	rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade
	opens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets
	into the crowd -- vampire genocide.

	The strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires
	try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes
	clogged with liquefying bodies -- 

	-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their
	opening, surge forward en masse -- 

	Blade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!-
	unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. 

	THE SWORD

	Four acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so
	sharp it could cleave a shadow in two.

	Blade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING
	VAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half --

	ON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB,

	a LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword,
	sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the
	vampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies.

	Beat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses --

	SOMETHING BIG

	rising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward,
	cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb
	falls to the floor -- 

	-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into
	Blade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables,
	slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the
	ceiling. 

	Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot-
	something nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head,
	jaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual
	scarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos. 

	Blade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at
	bay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a
	stake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx.
	Quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. 

	Blade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his
	leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open,
	drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES -- 

	The bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and
	nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to
	pull out the stake --

	Blade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm,
	effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board.

	UP ABOVE, 

	mounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a
	cross-bow bolt straight into the lens. 

	Blade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest.

				BLADE
		Where is Deacon Frost?

	Quinn glares, trying to speak, gagging on the stake still lodged in
	his trachea --

				BLADE
		Got something in your throat.

	Blade yanks the stake free. The vampire laughs, air whistling through
	his ruined larynx. 

				QUINN
		Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying 
		shit --

				BLADE
		Frost.

	Quinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade
	sees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips
	a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness -- 

				QUINN
		You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's 
		rising, the Sleeper's gonna --

	Blade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH!
	Quinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work,
	ignoring the howling pyre behind him:

	All evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few
	oily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by
	the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition.

	DENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade
	approaches, he cringes back --

				DENNIS
		Please don't --

	Blade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward,
	rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't
	any.

	Blade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade
	starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step --

	A COCKROACH

	scurries out from underfoot. 

	Blade adjusts his footfall, sparing the roach. He continues on up the
	stairs, disappearing in the smoky haze. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. CITY HOSPITAL, AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

	CAMERA FOLLOWS a bagged corpse as it's rolled into the autopsy room
	by an ASSISTANT. 

				ASSISTANT
		Brought you a baked potato, nice
		and crispy. Still warm, too.

	CURTIS WEBB, the forensic pathologist (30s, white bread, a little on
	the smarmy side) steps forward, unzips the bag --

	It's Quinn, what's left of him, anyway. Burnt to a charcoal
	briquette, limbs twisted horribly, oozing fluids.

	Curtis turns his head, grimacing, wafting the air.

				CURTIS
		Jesus, that's rank -- 

	Curtis turns back, makes note of the blackened stump where Quinn's
	arm used to be, the ruined throat -- 

				CURTIS
		What's his story?

				ASSISTANT
		Paramedics said he was still screaming 
		when they found him. Looks like some 
		joker had stapled him to a wall.

				CURTIS
		Pretty.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL, HEMATOLOGY LAB - NIGHT

	MICROSCOPE POV

	of a slide-mounted blood smear stained with Wright stain (blue ink).
	What we see is a collection of donut-shaped pink things (red blood
	cells) intermingled with some small blue specks (platelets) and the
	occasional larger, light-blue blobs (white blood cells).

	KAREN JANSEN (20s), a fine-featured hematologist with a social life
	in suspended animation, sits back from the microscope, stumped. Next
	to her is JULIE WHITAKER, a cheerful chemtech. 

				KAREN
		You took this off a DOA?

	Curtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding.

				KAREN
		This isn't human blood.

				CURTIS
		Then what is it?

				KAREN
		I don't know --
			(re: microscope)
		Look at this blood smear -- 

	Curtis takes a look for himself.

				KAREN
		The red blood cells are biconvex, 
		which is theoretically impossible. 
		They're hypochromic, there's virtually 
		no hemoglobin in them. 
			(shaking her head)
		Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, 
		they should be mononucleated.

				CURTIS
		What about the chemistry panel? 

	Karen looks to Julie, who reaches for a computer print-out.

				JULIE
		Blood sugar level is three times the 
		norm, phosphorous and uric acid are 
		off the scales.
			(shrugs)
		Like the woman said, impossible.

	Karen removes her glasses, rubbing the bridge of her nose.

				KAREN
		Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm 
		really not in the mood for one of your 
		practical jokes.

				CURTIS
			(insistent)
		It's not a joke. I've got the stiff 
		sitting in the morgue right now -- 
		look, just come up and see him, okay? 
		Five minutes, that's all I ask.

				KAREN
		I thought you promised to give me some 
		distance?

				CURTIS
		This is purely professional curiosity, 
		Karen, I swear.

	Karen rolls her eyes, lets loose a tired sigh.

				KAREN
		Five minutes, not a second more. And I 
		don't want to hear a word about "us".

				CURTIS
		No problem.

	INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - NIGHT

	The dead of night, not a mouse in the house. Curtis and Karen, each
	garbed in a mask, stand on either side of Quinn's body, which now
	rests on the autopsy table.

	QUINN'S BODY

	A preliminary exploratory Y-incision has been made across the chest,
	stretching from shoulder to shoulder, then continuing on down the
	abdomen. Ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart
	and lungs.

				KAREN
		You haven't started in on the internal 
		organs?

				CURTIS 
		Just the blood sample from the 
		pericardial sac.

	Curtis pauses, studying Quinn's disfigured face -- the features seem
	much less damaged now -- almost as if the corpse were healing itself.

				CURTIS
		That's weird --

				KAREN
		What?

				CURTIS
		He looks different now, burns are less 
		extreme, some of these wounds have 
		closed up -- 

	Curtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. He leans over Quinn,
	shining the light into one of his eyes.

				CURTIS
		Tell me something, honestly, you ever 
		have second thoughts about us?

				KAREN
			(grudgingly)
		Sometimes --

	Curtis looks up from the corpse, grinning beneath his mask.

				KAREN
		-- but then I remember what an 
		ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back 
		to reality. 

				CURTIS
		Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart 
		here --

	Quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs
	into Curtis' jugular. He snaps the man's neck in two for easier
	access, sucking in blood like a living vacuum. 

	Karen stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools CLATTERING.

	QUINN

	rises from the table, flinging Curtis' twitching body aside. He curls
	his blood-soaked lips back, baring viper-like fangs, emitting a
	GUTTURAL GROWL --

				QUINN
			(crazed by thirst)
		-- more -- blood --

	Karen backs into the corpse drawers, but Quinn is upon her in a half-
	second, wrapping a hand about her throat. His mouth opens/morphs
	disturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole, caustic saliva
	dripping from his canines -- 

	Karen tries to turn her head away, but Quinn's grip is vise-like. She
	finds herself staring into his eyes -- pupils pulsing rapid-fire,
	opening and closing, hypnotic --

	As Quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into Karen's carotid artery and
	starts to nurse --

	BANG!!! A load of MAHOGANY buckshot chews into Quinn's side. He HOWLS
	in pain. Another load catches him full in the face. He drops Karen.
	She falls to the floor -- 

	KAREN'S POV

	The sound of RUSHING BLOOD pounding through her skull. Everything
	spinning. She struggles to move, turns her head, finds herself eye to
	eye with Curtis' corpse.

	ON QUINN

	rising, his face torn up, smoking. WHIP PAN TO --

	BLADE, 

	standing at the entrance to the morgue, a streetsweeper auto-shotgun
	in hand, sizing Quinn up.

				BLADE
		Now don't we look dapper?

	Quinn BELLOWS with rage, ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration
	doors from its hinges, flinging it at Blade like it was lawn
	furniture --

	Blade rolls to the side as the door CRASHES against the wall. Quinn
	runs, moving through the morgue like a human tornado, heading for the
	windows at the end of the room --

	SMASH!!! Out goes Quinn, taking half the wall with him. Blade rushes
	to the decimated window, looks down --

	BLADE'S POV

	Quinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below,
	caving it in. He springs off, loping across the tarmac on three
	limbs, then -SCREECH!-THWUMP!- rolling up onto the hood of an
	oncoming car, before disappearing into the night --

	BACK UP ABOVE,

	Blade spins, SEES Karen bleeding her life away on the floor. She
	reaches a hand out to him, beseeching --

	Blade pulls away from her grasp, takes a step towards the exit --
	then hesitates. 

	A flicker of doubt washes across Blade's face. He looks down at Karen
	once more, wrestling with his conscience, finally making a decision.
	He kneels, scoops Karen up into his arms. Just then, 

	TWO POLICEMEN 

	rush into the morgue, weapons drawn --

				UNIFORM #1
		Hold it, ass-hole!

	Blade ignores them, turning to face the window before him. It's a
	good thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building, a parking
	structure -- and damned if Blade doesn't seem to be considering the
	jump.

	The Police close in, agitated. Blade crouches, switches Karen to a
	one-handed grip --

				UNIFORM #1
		I said hold it!!!

	-- and jumps.

	EXT. HOSPITAL/ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

	Blade clears the impossible distance -- almost. He snags the ledge of
	the adjacent parking structure with his left hand even as Karen slips
	from the grasp of his right --

	-- a last-second save, his fingers clamping around her wrist, is all
	that stands between Karen and street pizza. She SCREAMS anyway,
	dangling below him --

	Blade GRUNTS, swinging Karen like a pendulum, heaving her up and over
	the ledge as if she were a sack of potatoes. She lands on her
	shoulder, clutching it in pain --

	Blade heaves himself up, crouching beside her.

				KAREN
			(gasping)
		My shoulder -- dislocated --

	Blade places a hand on her shoulder, another around her elbow and
	without any consideration to discomfort -CRACK!- brutally pops it
	back in place. Karen SCREAMS again as he scoops her up once more and
	heads for --

	HIS '69 OLDSMOBILE 442, 

	which is parked nearby. Midnight-black. The definitive high-
	performance heavy-metal muscle machine with an engine big enough to
	power an Apollo rocket. 

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade sets Karen down in the passenger seat, climbs behind the wheel,
	keys the ignition. The engine ROARS to life, belching fumes through
	the dual exhaust. Blade floors it, burning serious rubber as the Olds
	vanishes from sight. 

	BACK AT THE DEMOLISHED MORGUE WINDOW 

	as the two policemen stare numbly in open-mouthed astonishment.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

	Blade pilots the Olds down the streets, moving through a series of
	increasingly degenerating neighborhoods, coming at last to the
	sprawling warehouse district.

	EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT 

	The Olds approaches a mammoth industrial facility that's been
	cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire. Ultra-violet
	floodlights illuminate the area, while an army of security cameras
	keep a watchful eye. 

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade glances at Karen, cursing himself for giving into his emotions.
	He hits a remote secured to the sun visor --

	EXT. BLADE'S OLDS/ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

	A gate grinds open. 

	We follow the Olds as it cruises around the back of the building,
	heading down a concrete loading ramp. At the bottom of the ramp, a
	heavy iron door rises. Blade's Olds disappears into the darkness.

	INT. ABANDONED FACTORY, INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	More UV lights flicker on. We're in a massive loading elevator which
	HUMS as it ascends, eventually reaching its destination with a
	BOOMING CLANG. The doors at the rear glide open. Blade guides the
	Olds out.

	INT. ABANDONED FACTORY, WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Set up in an old ironworks, the place looks like a cross between an
	auto junkyard and an armory. Equipment is strewn everywhere --
	lathes, mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical
	theater -- all of it jerry-rigged in a brutal, oily-tech.

	Blade climbs out of the Olds. He opens the passenger door and pulls
	Karen out, carries her in his arms. 

				BLADE
		Whistler!

				WHISTLER (O.S.)
		Are we bringing home strays now?

	ABRAHAM WHISTLER (60s)

	hobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. Gimlet-eyed,
	bitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. Though his face is
	lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense
	he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age. 

				BLADE
		She's been bitten.

				WHISTLER
		You should've killed her, then.

				BLADE
		She hasn't turned yet. 
			(pointedly)
		You can help her.

	Blade and Whistler stare each other down. Finally, Whistler turns and
	heads over to the operating theater.

				WHISTLER
		No promises. You watch her close. She 
		starts to turn, you finish her off.

	Blade nods, lays Karen down on the operating table. Whistler turns on
	an overhead light. Karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. She's lost a
	lot of blood.

	Whistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in
	Karen's neck with an antiseptic swab -- there's capillary damage
	around the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised,
	gangrenous. 

				WHISTLER
		Localized necrosis. She's borderline. 
		Another hour and she'd be well into 
		the change.

	Whistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under Karen's
	nose. As she starts to stir --

				WHISTLER
		Can you hear me, woman? 

	Karen's eyes open wide. She's scared, disoriented --

				KAREN
		What -- ?

				WHISTLER
		You've been bitten by a vampire. We've 
		got to try and burn out the venom, 
		just like a rattlesnake bite --

	Whistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic-looking
	fluid. Karen sees the syringe, resists --

				WHISTLER
		Hold her. 

	Blade forces Karen back. Whistler readies the syringe.

				WHISTLER
			(reading her name tag)
		"Dr. Karen Jansen". Listen close, I'm 
		going to inject you with an antidote 
		made from allium setivum -- garlic. 
		This is going to hurt. A lot. 

	Whistler sinks the needle into Karen's neck and depresses the
	plunger. "Hurt" doesn't begin to describe what Karen experiences
	next. Imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid
	through your veins.

	Karen SHRIEKS, her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms. The wound
	on her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous
	vampire venom.

	Karen clutches at Blade's arms, digging her nails in. She stares up
	at him with unflinching intensity, like a child desperately searching
	for assurance. 

	ON BLADE,

	uncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid. He'd like nothing more
	than to be done with this, but the only thing he can do is hold Karen
	while she rides out the seizures. 

	KAREN'S POV

	growing darker by the moment. The last thing she sees is Blade
	staring down at her -- then the night closes in. 

	INT. HOUSE OF EREBUS, MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club
	massacre. Blade turns and stares into the camera, fires his cross-
	bow. The screen cuts to static.

	A WITHERED, CLAWED HAND

	moves into frame, holding a remote. With a tap of a button, the
	monitor goes dark. 

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL a large, minimalist conference room -- the House
	of Erebus, seat of the vampire race's legislative assembly.

	Gathered around a massive table are the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS,
	representing a "rainbow" of racial colors -- names like PALLINTINE,
	VON ESPER, ASHE, BAVA. Two of them, the FAUSTINAS, are identical
	twins -- lethal-looking women with alabaster skin. 

	Chilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table. From
	time to time, a member will pour themselves a glass, or perhaps, help
	themselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks.

	At the head of the table is GAETANO DRAGONETTI, current vampire
	"Overlord". Blood-red eyes, parchment skin stretched over skull-like
	features. Incalculably ancient, but still deadly and virile as a
	viper. 

	Dragonetti speaks. He uses the "secret tongue" -- the ancient vampire
	language which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable
	of reproducing. 

				DRAGONETTI 
			(subtitled)
		Blade. Once again, our interests have 
		fallen victim to his ridiculous 
		crusade. He must be destroyed.

				FROST (O.S.)
			(in English)
		You're wrong, Dragonetti. 

	All heads turn. Who would dare such impudence?

	DEACON FROST, 

	a mere "Underlord" in the vampire hierarchy, steps forward.
	Strikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors,
	fueled with a passionate intensity. Amongst the vampire community
	he's known as an agitator. He's also the vampire equivalent of a
	racial supremacist.

				FROST
		The Day Walker represents a unique 
		opportunity. We'd be fools to waste 
		it by killing him. 

				DRAGONETTI
			(subtitled, taking umbrage)
		Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our 
		language, you insult the House of 
		Erebus by using the humans' 
		gutter-tongue, have you no respect 
		for tradition? 

				FROST
		Why should I respect something which 
		has outlived its purpose?

	This causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. Frost might as
	well have slapped Dragonetti in the face.

				DRAGONETTI
			(simmering)
		I see. And what would you have us do 
		with this "half-breed"?

				FROST
		Study him. Unlock the secrets of his 
		DNA. He's the key we've been looking 
		for. 

				DRAGONETTI
		He is an abomination! 

	Dragonetti slams his fist down, toppling a carafe, spilling blood
	across the tabletop. Frost looks to the others --

				FROST
		Why should we spend our lives 
		cringing from the daylight when his 
		blood offers us an alternative? 
		Enough talk. It's time we stepped out 
		of the shadows!

	Dragonetti looks apoplectic. ELDER PALLINTINE, a five-hundred year-
	old vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy, interjects.

				PALLINTINE
		You're out of line, Frost.

				FROST
		Am I? Or am I just the first to say 
		out loud what we've all been 
		thinking? 

	The fact that no one answers is telling. Dragonetti glowers at the
	other Elders, sensing the tide turning.

				DRAGONETTI
		The shadows suit us, Frost. We've 
		existed this way for thousands of 
		years. Who are you to challenge our 
		ways?

				FROST
		Someone who's sick of living off 
		scraps. The coming age belongs to us, 
		not the humans! 
			(to the others)
		When the final war between our races 
		comes, who do you want leading the 
		charge? 

	Frost stabs an accusing finger at the Overlord.

				FROST
		Some withered up fossil ready to snap 
		like a brittle bone at the first sign 
		of change?

	Dragonetti GROWLS like an beast, raking his claws across the tyro
	vampire's face, knocking him to the ground. 

				DRAGONETTI
		Get out!!!

	Frost picks himself up, touches the gashes on his cheek. Looks at his
	fingers, licks the blood from them. 

				FROST
		Careful, old fang. You might wake up 
		one day and find yourself extinct.

	Frost smiles at Dragonetti and calmly exits the room.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP, BLADE'S CELL - DAY

	ON KAREN as she comes to. Her wounds have been bandaged. She rises, a
	little shaky, takes in her surroundings -- She's in a spartan room,
	like a monk's cell. On the wall is a collection of knives and
	daggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre-
	looking runes. In the center of these weapons rests --

	BLADE'S SWORD,

	hanging like a cross in a chapel, dominating all else. Karen touches
	it. Then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt
	by a tarnished chain. She reaches for it, opens it --

	The locket features a photo, old and faded. It's the black woman we
	saw in the prologue, Vanessa, standing in the sunshine. 

	Karen moves towards the door, cautious -- 

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	We hear VOICES now, coming from beyond a series of black-out
	curtains. Karen pushes one aside and SEES --

	BLADE

	strapped into some kind of Inquisition-esque restraint chair. His
	shirt is off, his body slick with sweat. Whistler finishes strapping
	Blade in, then stands back, holding up a gas-powered pistol injector,
	hesitant --

				WHISTLER 
		I had to increase the dose. You're 
		building up a resistance to the 
		serum --

				BLADE
			(impatient)
		Just do it, old man.

	Whistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he presses the
	pistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. 

	Blade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard,
	veins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it
	tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his
	credit, Whistler never lets go.

	Mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs
	its violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly
	private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire
	hunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints,
	exhausted. 

	KAREN

	She draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed
	something she shouldn't have. She looks for an exit, SEES another
	doorway. She makes for it -- 

	INT. WHISTLER'S LAB - TANK ROOM - DAY 

	A dusty, darkened hole of a room, no windows, just shadows, crumbling
	concrete, rust stains, and --

	A LARGE TANK

	filled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical leads and
	biomedical sensors. SOMETHING floats within, suspended in the murky
	fluid -- a child , two or three years of age, drifting about like a
	medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde -- 

	THUMP! The child SLAMS up against the glass. Karen backpedals,
	startled. Its eyes are open now, pupils blown. It snarls, revealing a
	mouthful of razored fangs, trailing mouth-slime across the glass as
	it futilely tries to chew its way through to Karen.

	Karen stifles a sob, turning and running right into --

	BLADE,

	who now blocks the exit, sword in hand. Karen retreats a step,
	wary --

				BLADE
		You shouldn't be here.

				KAREN
		I'm sorry, I --

				WHISTLER (O.S.)
		Wandered off the beaten path, Doctor?

	Whistler has entered the room from a second doorway. Karen looks from
	Whistler to Blade, trapped between them --

				KAREN
		Who are you people?

				WHISTLER
		My name is Abraham Whistler.
			(re: Blade)
		This is Blade. As for our little 
		homunculus here --

	Whistler limps over to the tank, rapping his cane against it. The
	creature snaps at it reflexively, following the silver tip back and
	forth like a fish after a lure.

				BLADE
		-- he's a vampire.

				KAREN
		You're joking --

				WHISTLER
		Not at all. You're looking at a prime 
		specimen of the homines nocturna. 

	Whistler toys with the feral creature, engaging in a certain amount
	of sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied.
	Suddenly, it surges towards the top of the tank, clawing at the
	lid --

	Karen becomes alarmed -- but then a massive ELECTRICAL JOLT shocks
	the creature back into submission. 

				WHISTLER
		If Blade hadn't brought you here, you 
		would've wound up like him.

	Karen brings a hand to her bandaged neck, recalling the events of the
	previous night. She looks to Blade.

				KAREN
		Why did you help me?

	Blade scowls, his gaze flickering to Whistler.

				BLADE
		Stupidity.

				WHISTLER
			(appraising her)
		Maybe not. I did some checking, she's 
		a hematologist. Knowledge like that 
		might come in handy.

				BLADE
		It's not worth the risk. We can't 
		trust her.

				KAREN
		Why?

				BLADE
		Because you're tainted. The venom's 
		still inside you. You could still 
		turn on us.

				KAREN
		What happens then?

	Blade looks to Whistler -- as far as he's concerned, the debate's
	over.

				BLADE
		Then I have to take you out, just 
		like any other bloodsucker.

	Blade turns and exits. Whistler and Karen follow.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Beyond the grimy outer windows, we can see that the day is closing --
	long shadows, amber light. Karen lingers in the doorway, reeling from
	information overload. 

	Blade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt -- strapping on body
	armor, loading ammunition. He strings the tarnished locket around his
	neck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil, then pauses to
	inspect a modified pistol, sighting down the length of it.

				BLADE
		We hunt them, moving from one city to 
		the next, tracking their migrations. 
		They're hard to kill. They tend to 
		regenerate.

	CLACK! Blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber, then checks his
	next weapon --

				KAREN
			(sarcastic)
		So what do you use, then? A stake?

				WHISTLER
			(nodding)
		Some of the old wives' tales are true 
		-- they're severely allergic to 
		silver, various types of wood. Feed 
		them garlic and they'll go into 
		anaphylactic shock -- 

	Whistler picks up a customized rifle with a UV entry light, flicking
	on the beam.

				WHISTLER
		-- and of course there's always 
		sunlight, ultra-violet rays. 

	Karen shakes her head, incredulous -- 

				KAREN
		And you honestly expect me to believe 
		all this?

				BLADE
		I don't care what you believe. I 
		saved your life once, I don't plan on 
		making a habit of it. You want my 
		advice, you'll be out of the city by 
		nightfall. If you're stupid enough to 
		stay, that's your business.

				KAREN
		I can't just leave. I have a life 
		here, a career --

				BLADE 
		Not anymore. You've seen one of them. 
		You won't be allowed to live after 
		that. 

	Karen stares at Blade. Whistler gestures to the windows --

				WHISTLER
		There's a war going on out there. 
		Blade, myself, a few others -- we've 
		tried to keep it from spilling over 
		onto the streets. 
			(beat)
		Sometimes people like yourself get 
		caught in the cross-fire. 

	Whistler shrugs. As far as he's concerned, there's nothing else to
	say. Karen is still protesting, though. 

				KAREN
		I can go to the police. I have blood 
		samples back at the hospital. I can 
		show them. 

				BLADE
		Do it. You'll be dead before you can 
		file the complaint.

				KAREN
		That's ridiculous! No one's that 
		powerful. 

	Whistler sighs. He doesn't suffer fools gladly.

				WHISTLER 
		You're talking about a brotherhood 
		that predates the Catholic Church by 
		thousands of years. Their survival 
		depends on their ability to blend in. 
		Chances are, you've encountered them 
		and not even known it. On the subway, 
		in a bar --

	Blade slings his CAR-15 onto his shoulder, impatient. He starts
	towards the Olds, gesturing.

				BLADE
		Get in. Youre leaving.

				WHISTLER
		Wait.

	Whistler tosses a small metal canister to Karen.

				WHISTLER
		Consider it a parting gift. Vampire 
		mace -- silver nitrate, essence of 
		garlic. 

				KAREN
			(in disbelief)
		So that's it? You guys just patch me 
		up and send me on my way?

				WHISTLER
		There is one other thing. I'd buy 
		yourself a gun if I were you. If you 
		start becoming sensitive to the 
		daylight, if you start becoming 
		thirsty regardless of much you've had 
		to drink -- then I suggest you take 
		that gun and use it on yourself. 
		Better that, than the alternative.

	Karen stares at Whistler, horrified, as we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES - DAY

	We are deep in the narrow stacks of a sepulchral archive. Exactly
	what and where this place is will become more clear later on. 

	But for now, the CAMERA DRIFTS through the warren of aisles. Along
	the way, we catch a glimpse of a HULKING SILHOUETTE cowering behind a
	series of Japanese shoji screens. Later on, we find --

	FROST

	tucked away in a carrel, surrounded by books and scriptures, with
	only the SICKLY GLOW of his laptop to provide light.

				DRAGONETTI (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	Frost pauses, SEEING Dragonetti emerge from the shadows.

				DRAGONETTI
			(outraged)
		These archives are restricted to 
		members of the House of Erebus.

				FROST
		Please. You and the other Elders 
		wouldn't know what to do with these 
		texts if your lives depended on it. 
			(cryptically)
		Which, of course, they do.

				DRAGONETTI
		You're wasting your time, Frost. Far 
		greater scholars than you have tried 
		to decipher these words. Whatever 
		secrets they hold have been lost.

				FROST
		Perhaps.

	Frost studies Dragonetti, a self-satisfied grin on his face. If the
	act was intended to unnerve Dragonetti, it succeeded, though the
	ancient vampire would never admit it.

				DRAGONETTI
		What are you up to, Frost?

	Frost shuts the lid on his laptop, rising, drawing intimidatingly
	close to Dragonetti.

				FROST'S VOICE
		Wouldn't you like to know, Old Fang?

	A beat as the young turk stares his elder down. Dragonetti is the
	first to lose his nerve. Frost smiles and exits, leaving the old
	vampire to lick his wounds.

	CAMERA DRIFTS back to the hulking silhouette, which has been
	eavesdropping on the conversation. It quivers in fear.

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS (ON KAREN'S STREET CORNER) - DAY

	Blade brings the car to a stop. Karen looks at him. His eyes are
	hidden behind his glasses, his expression stone.

				BLADE
		Remember what we said. Keep your eyes 
		open. They're everywhere.

	EXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

	As Karen climbs out, Blade swings the door shut behind her. The Olds
	ROARS off down the quiet residential street. 

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, LOBBY - DAY

	Karen crosses the lobby, stepping into an elevator. Just as the doors
	are closing, a WOMAN and TWO MEN duck in alongside her. 

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Silence, the uncomfortableness of an elevator ride magnified tenfold.
	Karen can FEEL the eyes of her fellow passengers upon her. Finally
	succumbing to paranoia, she hazards a glance -- would she be able to
	tell if these people weren't human? The woman turns to Karen,
	smiles --

	Karen surreptitiously fishes the "vampire mace" from her pocket,
	clutching it -- and now one of the men turns to look at her,
	nodding --

	INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

	The elevator doors open. Karen hurries out, heads left, finds herself
	in a deserted hallway. She looks back --

	-- then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out! As Karen raises
	the canister of mace --

	-- the trio turn and head down to the right. Karen breathes a sigh of
	relief, shakes her head.

	INT. KAREN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Karen enters quickly, bolting the door behind her. She picks up the
	phone, dials 911 --

				KAREN
		I need the police. This is an 
		emergency --

	As Karen waits to be connected, she moves to the back entrance and
	checks the locks -- then the windows, then the fire escape --
	finally, a VOICE comes on the other end.

				KAREN
		Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was 
		with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital 
		last night -- that's right, I 
		witnessed the attack --
			(listening)
		115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll 
		wait here. Please hurry.

	Karen hangs up the phone and turns -- 

	A SHAFT OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT

	streams in through a window. Karen forces herself to look at it and
	winces, shielding her eyes. Again, she brings a hand to the bandaged
	wound on her neck. She moves to the window, pulling the shade down,
	frightened.

				KAREN
		Get a grip on yourself, girl.

	She sinks down into a chair to wait, setting Whistler's vampire mace
	aside. Then she shuts her eyes, massaging her temples. We SEE --

	A BRIEF FLASH OF

	Quinn, his mouth opening wide, saliva dripping from his fangs. His
	pupils pulsating hypnotically. We rush into his gaping maw and --

	WHAM! We're back to reality. Karen wakes with a start, looks to the
	windows -- time has passed, it's getting dark outside --

	-- and someone is KNOCKING at the front door. Karen reaches for the
	vampire mace, then moves to the door. She looks through the peephole,
	cautious --

				KAREN
		Who is it? 

	KAREN'S POV (FISH-EYE)

	A POLICE OFFICER stands in the hallway -- 30s, handsome, a knight in
	shining armor as far as she's concerned. 

				GIDEON
		Sergeant Gideon. I'm responding to a 
		911 call. 

	Karen visibly relaxes. She opens the door and steps aside, allowing
	Gideon to enter.

				KAREN
		Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen -- 

	Gideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies
	Karen's face, the bandages on her neck.

				GIDEON
		Are you all right?
			(off Karen's nod)
		I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've 
		been anxious to get a hold of you. You 
		disappeared on us for a while. 

				KAREN
		I know. Listen -- do you have any idea 
		what happened to Curtis, the other 
		doctor?

				GIDEON
			(matter of fact)
		Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry 
		about that if I were you.

				KAREN
			(alarmed)
		Why?

	Gideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun. 

				GIDEON
		Because you're dead too.

	Karen GASPS. She has a half-second to act -- in which she triggers a
	spray of vampire mace into Gideon's face. Gideon stumbles back,
	blinded, cursing, rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes -- 

	Karen expects pyrotechnics -- but the end result is little more than
	an annoyance. A second later, Gideon is simply blinking, sniffing his
	fingers, confused --

				GIDEON
		Garlic?

				KAREN
		He said it would work against 
		vampires --

	Gideon bursts out laughing.

				GIDEON
		Who said I was a vampire? 

	Gideon shakes his head, still snickering. He forces Karen against the
	wall, placing the gun against her head --

				GIDEON
		Thanks for the laugh. You can shut 
		your eyes if you want to.

	CRASH!!! The front door explodes open as Blade comes flying through
	it! 

	Gideon tries to bring his pistol up -- but Blade grips the man's hand
	and squeezes. Gideon SCREAMS as his bones snap like kindling. The
	pistol falls from his grasp --

	Blade fires his fist into Gideon's gut again and again, then flings
	the officer across the room, sending him SMASHING into a glass-cased
	cabinet. Bleeding, battered, Gideon struggles to stand --

	Blade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he
	sinks to the floor in a half-conscious haze.

	Blade stands over Gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing
	heavily, touching down after his adrenaline high. Finally, he looks
	to Karen --

				BLADE
		You okay?

	Karen nods, glances at Gideon --

				KAREN
		How did you know?

				BLADE
		Figured they'd send someone after you. 
		Thought I'd wait around and see who 
		showed up.

				KAREN
		You used me as bait?!

				BLADE
		It worked, didn't it?

				KAREN
		But, he could've --

				BLADE
		He didn't. Get over it.

	Blade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the
	neck, the skin behind the ear -- 

				KAREN
		But he's a policeman --

				BLADE
		He's a familiar. A human who works for 
		the vampires. See this mark?

	Blade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol
	tattooed into the man's scalp.

				BLADE
		That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire 
		cattle brand. That means Officer 
		Friendly here is someone's property. 
		Any of the other vampire's try to 
		bleed him, they'll have to answer to 
		Friendly's owner --
			(studying the glyph)
		This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. 
		We've been tracking him for a while 
		now --

				KAREN
		Why in God's name would anyone want to 
		work for them?

				BLADE
		Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If 
		they're loyal, if they prove 
		themselves, then their masters will 
		turn them. 

				KAREN
		And that's a good thing?

				BLADE
		For some. Live forever, never get old. 
		The ultimate high. 

	Just then, Gideon MOANS. Blade drags the man up so they're eye to
	eye.

				BLADE
		How 'bout you, Officer? You a good 
		little bloodhound?

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

	Blade and Karen are now standing by Gideon's police cruiser which is
	parked outside Karen's apartment. Blade shoves Gideon against the
	hood of the cruiser. He finds Gideon's keys, moves to the trunk,
	opens it --

	IN THE TRUNK --

	A sophisticated medical cooling unit for transporting organs. Blade
	opens the unit, coolant vapor hisses out. Inside are plastic bags
	containing blood. 

				BLADE
		Looks like our friend was 
		blood-running.
			(to Gideon)
		Where were you headed?

	Gideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth --

				GIDEON
		Mphuck you --

	WHAM! Blade plants Gideon's face into the hood of the car. Gideon
	GROANS, coughs --

				GIDEON
		Jesus -- 1227 Brookner -- 
		Holliston Clinic --

	Blade releases him, then reaches for his Casull.

				KAREN
		What are you doing?!

				BLADE
		Preventive medicine.

	Karen steps in front of Blade, shielding Gideon.

				KAREN
		You can't do this, he's human, it's 
		murder.

				BLADE
		It's war, now get the fuck out of the 
		way!

	Karen grabs Blade's arm, wrestling with him, trying to push his hand
	away. As the two of them struggle, Gideon makes a break for it,
	stumbling across the lawn. Blade pushes Karen aside, takes aim,
	FIRES --

	-- but Gideon ducks into an alley, disappearing from sight. Blade
	spins on Karen, enraged --

				BLADE
		God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea 
		what you just did?! He'll warn them. 
		They'll be waiting!

	But Karen's defiant, she's not backing down.

				KAREN
		You were going to kill him. What was I 
		supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and 
		pretend I didn't see what I saw? 

	Blade tears off his glasses. Karen gasps --

	BLADE'S EYES

	aren't human, nor are they vampire. They're something else -- emerald
	green, laced with swirling flecks of red. 

				BLADE
		Let me set you straight on something, 
		Doctor. What you've "seen" so far is 
		nothing. The world you live in's just 
		the sugar-coated topping. There's 
		another world beneath it, the real 
		world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. 
		If you want to survive in it, you'd 
		better pull your head out of your ass. 

	Blade slips his glasses back on, leaving Karen shocked into silence.
	He heads for his Olds without looking back, climbs in, guns the
	engine. In seconds, he's gone, tearing off down the street in a cloud
	of exhaust.

	EXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - DUSK

	We are soaring through the air above the gleaming city skyline,
	moving towards the Edgewood Towers whose windows reflect the blood-
	red sinking sun.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Suffused lighting, elegant tile-work featuring evocative mosaics, the
	quiet strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC -- 

	MERCURY,

	the lupine Gaultier girl from the club, glides beneath the water,
	surfacing at the deep end. We SEE --

	FROST

	lounging in a chair, studying a laptop which rests beside him. On the
	screen is a digitized image -- a page taken from an ancient
	manuscript, written in a secret tongue.

	Officer Gideon waits nearby, cradling his ruined hand, his battered
	face cast downward like a boy who's been called into the Principal's
	office. 

				GIDEON
		Look, I know you're disappointed --

				FROST
		Crestfallen.

				GIDEON
		Blade was waiting for me. There wasn't 
		anything I could do.

	Frost nods, lapsing into brooding contemplation.

				FROST
		Tell me something, Gideon, what blood 
		type are you?

	Gideon hesitates. Is this a trick question?

				GIDEON
		I don't really know --

				FROST
		Take a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps? 
		I'm interested in the antigens here, 
		the agglutination reaction --

	Gideon stammers as Frost rises. In the blink of an eye, Frost lifts
	Gideon from the floor, dangling the Officer over the deep end of the
	pool by his throat --

				FROST
		I'm going to guess AB positive.

	Gideon GURGLES as Frost's fingernails pierce his flesh, drawing
	blood. Then Frost releases him --

	Gideon plunges into the pool. Mercury is on him in a heartbeat,
	tearing him apart like a Great White consuming a piece of chum. The
	water churns violently around them, clouding with red.

	When it's over, Mercury rises from the pool, dripping wet, covered
	from head to toe in a crimson sheen. 

	She kisses Frost hungrily, letting Gideon's blood flow from her mouth
	to his. Frost flicks a tongue over his lips.

				FROST
		AB positive. Give the man a prize.

	Below them, Gideon's lifeless body sinks towards the pool bottom, his
	police badge twinkling like sunken treasure.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

	Blade's Olds cruises to a stop. We're in a low-end commercial
	district -- junky heaven. Blade climbs out, pulling an automatic
	rifle from the back seat, then heading into an alleyway. 

	EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

	Blade makes his way down the alley, cautious -- he SEES mountains of
	trash, boarded-up windows, overlapping layers of gang graffiti -- a
	RAT crouching on a trash dumpster, gnawing on a dead pigeon --

	-- then a SOUND behind Blade, the scuffle of feet -- 

	Blade whirls, drawing his sword, CHARGING at an approaching shadow,
	stopping mere millimeters from decapitating --

	KAREN,

	who's been backed up against the wall, her eyes wide with fright.
	Blade's sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm, having drawn
	just the slightest taste of blood.

				BLADE
		What the hell are you doing?! I could 
		have killed you!

	Blade lowers his sword. Karen remembers to breathe. She slumps,
	tracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with
	her body.

				KAREN
		I remembered the address. I followed 
		you --

	Blade shakes his head, amazed.

				BLADE
		Do you have a death wish or are you 
		just stupid?

	Karen pushes away from the wall, angry --

				KAREN
		Look, if what you say is true, if 
		there's a chance I could turn into one 
		of them, then I've got no choice, do 
		I? I have to work with you. I need to 
		learn everything I can about them. 
		It's the only way I'll be able to find 
		a cure for myself.

				BLADE
		There is no cure. 

				KAREN
			(defiant)
		You don't know that.

	Blade turns and moves to the end of the alley, studying the graffiti-
	covered wall intently --

				KAREN
		What are you looking at?

				BLADE
			(gesturing)
		What do you see here?

				KAREN
		Graffiti --

				BLADE
		Look closer.

	Blade indicates a design amongst the various gang-banger tags that
	looks something like a post-modern hieroglyphic.

				BLADE
		This isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire 
		marking. It means there's a safe-house 
		nearby. 
		A place they can go if dawn is coming. 

	Blade points to a building across the street --

	THE HOLLISTON CLINIC,

	your basic inner-city blood-barter establishment where desperate
	transients parley their plasma into cash.

				KAREN
			(recognizing it)
		I know this place -- it's a blood 
		bank. 

				BLADE
		Owned by vampires. There's one of 
		these in every major city, and just 
		like Domino's, they always deliver.
			(looking to Karen)
		You telling me you're ready to walk 
		through that door?

	Karen nods. Blade continues to stare at her, taking her measure --
	there's a strength in this woman's eyes, she has the soul of a
	fighter -- and Blade recognizes it. 

				BLADE
		All right, then, listen up, Vampire 
		Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water 
		don't do dick, so forget what you've 
		seen in the movies. 

	Blade enumerates the following on his fingers:

				BLADE
		You use the stake, silver, or 
		sunlight, got it? 

	Blade holds up one of his Casulls. 

				BLADE
		Know how to use one of these?

	Karen takes the weapon from him, eyes all over it.

				KAREN
		No.

	Blade takes the gun back, snorting derisively.

				BLADE
		Safety's off, round's already 
		chambered -- 
			(cocking it)
		Silver hollow-points filled with 
		garlic. You aim for the heart or the 
		head, anything else is a one-way 
		ticket to a pine box.

	Blade hand it to her again, then starts across the street towards the
	clinic. Karen follows --

	INT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, LOBBY - NIGHT

	Blade enters, swinging his rifle around for all to see.

				BLADE
		Get out. Now.

	The POTENTIAL DONORS scramble for the exit. Behind the counter,
	TANAKA, a male nurse, reaches for an alarm button. Blade vaults over
	the counter, aiming his rifle. 

				BLADE
		I know you're blood-running. Who's 
		your sponsor? 

				TANAKA
		I don't know what you're --

	POW! Blade backhands him across the face hard enough to loosen his
	teeth. Karen flinches, stepping forward -- 

				KAREN
		What if you've made a mistake?

	Blade pins Tanaka's head to the wall, turning it to the side --
	revealing the man's glyph. It's different than Gideon's, looking more
	like a Japanese kanji character.

				BLADE
		What's this? A birthmark?

	Blade grips Tanaka by his collar, shoving him through a doorway --

	INT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT

	Karen and Blade SEE supply cabinets, cots, a number of locked
	refrigeration units. Blade FIRES into the door handle of one of the
	units, tears it open -- the fridge is stacked floor to ceiling with
	plastic packets of blood.

				BLADE
			(to Karen)
		Still think we might be wrong?
			(to Tanaka)
		How much are you shipping?

				TANAKA
		Bite me!

	Blade opens FIRE, sweeping his rifle around the room, shooting
	everything in sight. Glass cabinetry shatters, ampoules and
	vacutainers go flying. Tanaka cowers, arms wrapped about his head.

	Blade stops shooting. He leans down towards Tanaka, placing the end
	of his rifle against the man's forehead. Tanaka looks like he's about
	to wet his pants.

				BLADE
		I've got a message for your masters -- 
		the night's no longer safe for their 
		kind.

	Blade pulls back his rifle, leaving a red indentation mark where the
	end of the rifle barrel pressed into Tanaka's skin. He starts towards
	the exit. Karen follows.

	CUT TO:

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen return to the Olds. He keys the ignition, lets the
	engine idle. They're parked down the street from the blood clinic.
	Karen looks to Blade, confused --

				KAREN
		You let him go -- 
			(off Blade's nod)
		An hour ago you were ready to kill a 
		man for less, this one didn't even 
		talk.

				BLADE
		He will.

	Blade points --

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

	Tanaka rushes from the clinic, climbing behind the wheel of a Mustang
	parked nearby. He takes off -- 

	Blade follows the Mustang, CLICKING on a cell-phone scanner mounted
	on the dash. Numbers flash on the LCD screen as it searches for a
	signal, then locks onto it. We hear a DIAL TONE, then a number being
	dialed --

				AUTOMATED VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		"You've reached a number that is no 
		longer in service. Please consult your 
		operator and try again".

				TANAKA'S VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		It's Tanaka, PIN number 
		sixteen-zero-zero-nine --

	A "real" voice comes on the line:

				VOICE
			(filtered, on scanner)
		Yes?

	Karen looks to Blade, impressed. 

	INT. TANAKA'S MUSTANG - NIGHT

	Tanaka speeds, shouting into the speaker phone -- 

				TANAKA
		Get me Pearl! 

				VOICE
			(filtered, on speaker)
		Pearl is feeding --

				TANAKA
		Look, I'm not fucking around here! 
		That hunter Frost has been talking 
		about? He was just at the clinic. Tore 
		the goddamn place apart!

	EXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	Tokyo town. A black edifice, no windows, secured parking, no signage
	except for a purple neon scroll above the entrance -- a FLASHING
	KANJI, just like the glyph tattooed on Tanaka's neck.

	Tanaka's Mustang pulls into the parking lot. He climbs out, flagging
	away the valets, heads inside --

	WHIP PAN TO

	Blade's Olds stopping a few blocks down the street.

	INT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT

	Blade kills the engine, studying The Black Pearl.

				BLADE
		Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place 
		is crawling with them.
			(pointing)
		See the valets over there? They're 
		vampires. So is the doorman.

				KAREN
		How can you tell?

				BLADE
		The way they move, they way they 
		smell --

	Blade continues to scan the area, pointing out a few more likely
	candidates --

				BLADE
		The whore on the corner, she's one 
		too. So are the two men standing under 
		the streetlight.

	Blade reaches into the back seat, retrieves his sword and a satchel.
	He snaps open his shotgun, loads it. Karen continues to study the
	vampires Blade identified.

				KAREN
		So many of them -- I still can't 
		believe they're real.

				BLADE
		There are worse things than vampires 
		out there.

				KAREN
		Like what?

				BLADE
			(pumping his shotgun)
		Like me.

	Blade reaches for the door --

	EXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen climb out. He lets his shotgun fall within the folds
	of his longcoat and starts across the street -- only to be challenged
	by a HULKING DOORMAN at the entrance.

				DOORMAN
		I'm sorry, sir -- do you have an 
		invitation?

	INT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	CRASH! The front door flies open as the Doorman's body sails through.
	Blade enters, Karen at his heels -- 

	The 'Pearl' is an all-hours strip club cum casino catering
	exclusively to Japanese zaibatsu clientele. Dimly lit, the air thick
	with cigarette smoke, deafening MUSIC. Go boards, pachinko machines,
	sexy little MANGA WAIFS in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks --

	STRIPPERS writhe in the circular "pit" tables surrounded by HOWLING
	grab-ass men. But that's nothing compared to --

	The MAIN ATTRACTION,

	who's doing a bump and grind down the runway, shaking a body worthy
	of a schoolboy's wet dream. Her attire? A leather S&M face mask,
	nipple rings, 6-inch spikes, and a pair of panties to hide her
	modesty.

	Blade scans the room -- just in time to see Tanaka ducking into a
	back hallway. Blade pushes towards the rear of the club. Karen
	follows. 

	ON THE STRIPPER

	as she catches sight of Blade and freezes in mid-routine. The
	stripper pulls off her hood. Long black hair with a streak of white
	tumbles down her back -- it's Mercury. 

	INT. BLACK PEARL, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen head past the bathrooms. At the end of the hall is a
	door marked "OFFICE". Just then, the Men's door opens, a DRUNK
	COLLEGE KID steps out, SEES Blade --

				KID
		Hey --

	Blade plants a hand over the kid's face, shoving him back into the
	bathroom as he kicks open the office door --

	INT. THE BLACK PEARL, BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

	Tanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch -- 

	Blade traps Tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. He CRASHES
	into a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. Karen
	winces. Blade grabs a handful of Tanaka's hair, yanks his head up --

				BLADE
		Where's the entrance?!

				TANAKA
		I can't -- they'll kill me!

	Blade rips off his glasses and gives Tanaka an eyeful -- his irises
	pulse and glow. 

				BLADE
		I got news for you, butt-boy. You're 
		already dead. 

				TANAKA
			(terrified)
		Oh God, shit -- behind the bookcase --

	Blade drops Tanaka, moves to the bookcase. He searches the wall a
	moment, then finds a trigger. Hits it -- the bookcase slides aside,
	revealing a hidden elevator. As Blade moves to put his sunglasses
	back on --

	BLADE'S POV (IN THE REFLECTION OF HIS SUNGLASSES)

	We see Tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer,
	swinging it up --

	Blade unholsters one of his Casulls faster than any gunslinger in
	history. He FIRES over his own shoulder, BLOWING Tanaka back against
	the wall. 

	Blade puts his sunglasses back on, motions to the elevator, then nods
	to Karen --

				BLADE
		After you. 

	INT. THE BLACK PEARL, ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	The elevator descends. Then a tone CHIMES, signaling the end of the
	ride. The doors hiss open -- 

	INT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen enter the narrow, maze-like "stacks" of the vampire
	archives, weaving their way through shelves of climate-controlled,
	digitized records. 

				KAREN
		What is this place?

				BLADE
		Some kind of archive --

				KAREN
		Isn't this all a little high-tech? I 
		thought vampires were more into 
		cobwebs and coffins.

				BLADE
		You've been watching too much TV. 
		They've got their claws sunk into 
		everything -- finance, real estate, 
		politics. Probably own half of 
		Downtown. 

	Blade pulls a CD-ROM from the shelves, its spine labeled in
	indecipherable vampire glyphs.

				BLADE
		This must be where they keep their 
		records --

	He pauses, hearing a DISTANT WHISPER. Blade signals quiet, silently
	leading Karen through the stacks towards -- 

	PEARL'S LAIR

	A vestibule of sorts, leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of
	rice paper shoji screens and tatami mats. Candles glow within,
	illuminating a MONSTROUSLY OBESE SHADOW beyond the translucent rice
	paper walls.

	The shadow speaks in a tremulous, bird-like voice -- the secret
	tongue. As Blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes --

				PEARL'S VOICE
			(frightened)
		Lorca, is that you?

	Blade slides open the nearest shoji screen --

	INT. PEARL'S BED CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Nothing Karen's seen up until this point could prepare her for the
	archive's curator --

	PEARL,

	a nine-hundred-pound androgynous vampire of Asian origin, lounging
	amidst pillowed rice mats, wearing a communications headset. Think of
	a cross between Divine and Jabba The Hutt. Skin the complexion of
	buttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood
	that he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin. 

	Pearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have
	been affixed to counter-balanced arms -- this way, Pearl can access
	information without leaving bed.

	Lying next to Pearl, dwarfed by the vampire's massive size, is the
	chalk-white body of a recently-drained NAKED BOY. 

	At the sight of Blade, Pearl's eyes widen in fear --

				PEARL
			(into a speakerphone)
		He's here!

				FROST'S VOICE
			(over speakerphone)
		Congratulations, Day-Walker.

				BLADE
		Frost?

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Frost paces the length of his pool, wearing a hands-free
	communications headset, grinning.

				FROST
		In the flesh, Blade. I understand 
		you've been looking for me. I'm 
		flattered.

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

	As Blade listens, Pearl reaches for his trackball, attempting to
	delete the document currently on his monitors -- but Blade lunges
	forward, sinking the tip of his sword into Pearl's fleshy throat.
	Pearl freezes. 

				BLADE
			(eyeballing Pearl)
		Don't be. You're another notch on my 
		sword hilt, nothing else.

	Frost's DEEP LAUGHTER drifts from the speakerphone.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

	Frost settles into his chair, enjoying the cat and mouse.

				FROST
		You're quick, Blade, I'll give you 
		that. In the space of an hour you've 
		crossed my familiar, destroyed a blood 
		bank --
			(beat)
		Now here you are in the heart of our 
		archives, terrorizing our curator.

				PEARL'S VOICE
		He has a knife to my throat, Frost! 
		He --

				FROST
			(cutting him off)
		You're history, Pearl. Have the good 
		grace to die with some dignity.
			(beat)
		Round one to you, Blade.

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

	CLICK, the line goes dead. Blade tosses his satchel on the bed, opens
	it. Inside is a hand-held UV lamp hooked up to a nine-volt battery.
	Pearl eyes the device, fearful -- 

				PEARL
		What is that?

				BLADE
		A sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty 
		questions. Depending on your answers, 
		you might get to have yourself a 
		tanning session. 

	Blade looks to Pearl's monitor and SEES a digitized image, the SAME
	MANUSCRIPT Deacon had been studying earlier. 

				BLADE
		What were you in such a big hurry to 
		delete just now?

	Pearl hesitates. Blade turns on the lamp. Pearl HOWLS as the harsh
	light falls upon him. Blade flicks the light off.

	Pearl cringes, GROWLING, his face smoking profusely. Exposure to the
	UV rays, even for one short second, has made his face blister like a
	plague victim's.

				PEARL
			(relenting)
		It's an epistle, a letter Frost has 
		been translating -- it prophesizes 
		LaMagra's return.

				BLADE
		And who is LaMagra?

	Pearl hesitates again -- Blade turns on the lamp for a longer time.
	Pearl thrashes, covering his face. His hands blacken, the skin
	sizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath. Karen has to avert
	her gaze --

	Blade turns off the lamp. Pearl SNARLS, his body quivering with
	poisonous rage.

				PEARL
		LaMagra is The Sleeper!!! 

	Blade leans in close so he's eye to eye with Pearl.

				BLADE
		Where's the original, Pearl? You must 
		have it around here somewhere.

	Pearl sweats blood, his flaking, slug-like lips quivering. 

				PEARL
		The vault --

	Blade follows Pearl's eyes to an armored door, then he stands back,
	handing the UV rig to Karen.

				BLADE
		If he moves, cook him.

	Blade approaches the vault door, sizing up its locking mechanism. He
	pulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the
	door, arming it with a BEEP!

				PEARL
		Please, I'll give you the combination 
		-- you'll damage the documents --

				BLADE
		That's the point.

	Enraged, Pearl LUNGES from his bed. Karen triggers the UV rig, flash-
	frying him to a blackened crisp. Pearl quivers, his enormous body
	smoking like a piece of charred meat. 

	Blade looks back at Karen with newfound respect. She shrugs.

				KAREN
		He moved.

	Blade turns back to the vault, setting off the charge. BOOM! Blade
	kicks the damaged door in, knocking it clear off its hinges --

	INSIDE THE VAULT,

	ancient papers flutter through the smoky air like wind-borne leaves.
	Blade and Karen SEE a lucite-encased document -- fragments of an
	ancient, calligraphied papyrus. 

				KAREN
		What are these?

				QUINN (o.s.)
		Curiosity killed the cat.

	Blade and Karen spin --

	-- QUINN,

	Mercury, and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the
	vault.

				QUINN
			(grins)
		Hola, amigo. Remember me?

	Karen triggers the UV light, but Mercury ducks under it, ripping it
	from her hands, crushing it. In a split-second, the she-demon has her
	claws around Karen's throat.

	As Blade reaches for his rifle, the vampires converge on him like
	quicksilver. They drag Karen and Blade out --

	PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER

	The vampires fling Blade against the wall, pinning him. 

				QUINN
		You took my arm, Blade. But that's 
		okay, I'm growing a new one --

	Quinn lifts up his "arm". A skeletal forearm has grown from the
	stump. It's got cartilage, sinew, and muscle, but no flesh yet. 

				QUINN
		Nice, huh? Think I'll ever play the 
		piano again?
			(shrugging)
		You can slice him, you can dice him, 
		and the man just keeps on coming. 

	Blade struggles violently, but Quinn is upon him, pounding his fist
	into Blade again and again and again -- giving him payback with
	compounded interest. When it's over, Quinn steps back, winded -- 

	Blade's head hangs down. He gasps, wincing, every breath sending a
	red hot poker to his gut. Quinn grabs a hold of Blade's jaw, forcing
	his head up. 

				QUINN
		Stay with me, sweetness, I'm not 
		through with you yet.

	Quinn pulls Blade's jacket open, sees the bandoleer of mahogany
	stakes. He tugs one out, admiring it.

				QUINN
		Teak. Nice craftsmanship. 
			(to the others)
		Now here's a man who takes his job 
		just a little too seriously, don't you 
		think?
			(back to Blade)
		Which reminds me, Blade, think I owe 
		you one --

	Quinn stabs the stake into Blade's shoulder. Blade CRIES OUT, tries
	to pull free. Karen, who's being held by Mercury, averts her gaze.

				QUINN
		Actually, if you want to get 
		technical, I owe you two.

	As Quinn reaches for another stake, Blade starts to laugh.

				QUINN
		What's so funny, bright eyes?

				BLADE
		I'm expecting some company.

	It's then that Quinn notices the micro ear-coil radio receiver in
	Blade's ear. As we MOVE IN on it, we hear a tiny VOICE squawking from
	it:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Get down!

	Blade kicks his feet out, sending Quinn flying backwards. He tears
	free of the vamps holding him and DIVES forward, knocking Karen to
	the ground just as --

	BOOM!!! The wall of Pearl's bedchamber EXPLODES INWARD, knocking
	Quinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet. 

	WHISTLER

	stands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his
	cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other. He balances the
	rifle against his hip like an over-the-hill gunslinger and OPENS FIRE
	on the vampires.

	Blade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown
	free from the vault. Seconds later, he and Karen are fleeing after
	Whistler, retreating back through his newly created exit.

	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	The three of them find themselves ankle-deep in a flooded sewer
	tunnel running parallel to the archives. Whistler pauses, wheezing
	from overexertion. 

				WHISTLER
		Christ, I'm too old for this. Somebody 
		get me a goddamn wheelchair.

	Blade leans against the tunnel wall, GRUNTING as he yanks the stake
	from his shoulder. He then pulls out a light-stick, snapping it,
	illuminating the area in a GREEN GLOW -- disturbing waves of
	GLITTERING COCKROACHES. 

	Meanwhile, Whistler pulls another explosive device from his backpack
	and sets it against the tunnel wall, arming it.

				KAREN
		How did you find us?!

	Whistler taps a tiny radio headset curled around his ear.

				WHISTLER
		We keep in radio contact. 

				KAREN
			(incredulous)
		You've been listening in the whole 
		time?

				WHISTLER
		You think I'd let him run loose 
		without a chaperone? Blade ferrets 
		their rat-holes out, I map them. Then 
		we blow them all to kingdom come.

	Whistler finishes arming the explosive device. It BEEPS. He turns
	back to Blade and Karen, referring to a handheld navigation device.

				WHISTLER
		There's a subway line due East of 
		here. We'd best make tracks. 

	INT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER, ARCHIVES - NIGHT

	An EXPLOSION rips through the bedchamber, mushrooming outward --

	INT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

	The EXPLOSION continues expanding, sending tables, drinks, and
	zaibatsu clientele flying.

	INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	As the group splashes through the water, a FIREBALL chases them down
	the tunnel. They duck into an alcove, narrowly avoiding the flames.
	Whistler WHOOPS with excitement, loving every minute of it. But his
	triumph is short-lived, for now we hear --

	-- a deafening chorus of HIGH-PITCHED VAMPIRE WAR CRIES coming from
	behind. Karen hazards a look back --

	THE VAMPIRES

	surge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on high-octane.
	There must be a dozen of them now and Quinn is right in the lead.

	Our trio hustles along, but Whistler stumbles, tumbling and sliding
	down a washout. The steep incline of the washout makes it virtually
	impossible for Whistler to climb back up to the main tunnel.

				KAREN
		Whistler!

				WHISTLER
		Go on, I'll be fine!

	Karen hesitates, but Blade yanks her down the tunnel --

				BLADE
		He can take care of himself! GO!!!

	They race through the twisting warren of tunnels, taking one turn
	after another, the vampires hot on their heels --

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen stumble out into a larger subway tunnel, which widens
	into a station stop up ahead. We can see the RED TAIL-LIGHTS of a
	train just pulling away from the platform -- Blade and Karen re-
	double their efforts, lungs burning, legs pumping like mad. Just as
	the train enters the next tunnel --

	-- they leap, dragging themselves up onto the back of the rear-
	passenger car. Blade SMASHES his fist through the emergency exit
	window, then lifts Karen up, helping her climb through into the
	car -- 

	-- but the vampires are still coming! Crawling along the tunnel walls
	on all fours, limbs a blur, claws striking the concrete and spewing
	out sparks. Closing fast. Too fast. 

	QUINN

	springs forward, snagging Blade's ankle with his "good" hand. The
	vampire's weight threatens to haul Blade down. Blade reaches to his
	back-scabbard, unsheathes his sword --

	THUNK! Blade brings the sword down on Quinn's good arm, cutting it
	off at the wrist! Quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels
	back into the darkness --

	THE AMPUTATED HAND,

	which continues to clutch at Blade's ankle, starts to melt. With a
	cry of disgust, Blade kicks the thing away. He turns and climbs
	through the window --

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 

	Karen helps Blade inside. He sinks to the floor of the otherwise
	deserted car, exhausted. He's looking ashen now. The whites of his
	eyes are shot through with red.

	Karen gets a good look at Blade's wounds -- the front of his jacket
	is soaked in blood. She reaches for him --

				KAREN
		You're hurt --

				BLADE
		Nothing that won't heal by dawn.

	Blade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small, gas-powered
	pistol-injector we saw Whistler inject him with earlier. He tries to
	load one of the ampoules into it, but because of his wounds, he's not
	having much luck -- 

				BLADE
			(frustrated)
		I need help with this --

	Karen nods, inserting the ampoule into the gun. Blade shrugs off his
	jacket, holds out his arm. Karen pauses --

				KAREN
		What am I injecting you with?

				BLADE
			(weakly)
		Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin 
		substitute.

	Karen locates a vein, presses the injector against it -- Blade
	tenses, grits his teeth, fights to keep his body thrashing as the
	serum enters his bloodstream. He grips the wall behind him --
	actually digs his nails into the metal surface -- the agony he's
	going through is excruciating, like nothing we could imagine. 

	When it's over, he slumps forward, spent, vulnerable, flushed with
	sweat. Karen stares at him --

				KAREN
		You're one of them, aren't you?

	Blade turns away from Karen, filled with self-loathing. 

				BLADE
		Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, 
		half-vampire.

	Off Karen's surprised reaction, we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	The loading elevator CLANGS to a stop. Blade throws the gate open.
	Karen helps him out. Now that they're safely back, the last of
	Blade's strength seems to dissipate. 

	WHISTLER

	is waiting for them, sitting at a workbench. 

				WHISTLER
		What took you so long?

				BLADE
		Don't even start, old man.

	Blade throws his sword aside, then moves off into the shadows,
	disappearing beyond the curtains. Karen looks to Whistler --

				KAREN
		Why didn't you tell me the truth 
		about him?

				WHISTLER
		We weren't sure we could trust you.

	Whistler sighs, removing his glasses.

				WHISTLER
		Blade's mother was attacked by a 
		vampire while she was pregnant. 
		Ultimately, she died, but her unborn 
		child lived. Unfortunately, he'd 
		undergone certain genetic changes 
		while in the womb --

	Whistler reaches for a pack of cigarettes, pulls one out. He thumbs a
	match, fires up. Takes a long drag --

				WHISTLER
		I found Blade when he was thirteen. 
		He'd been living on the streets, 
		feeding off the homeless. Apparently 
		the Thirst manifested itself at 
		puberty -- 
			(beat)
		I took him for one of them at first, 
		almost killed him, too. But then I 
		realized what he was. 

	CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Frost stands at the window, looking out at the glimmering cityscape
	before him.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Frost turns away from window. Quinn, Mercury, and the other vampires
	from the Black Pearl stand before him. Quinn cradles his amputated
	stump with his newly grown arm. 

				QUINN
		He took my fucking hand! Again!

				FROST
		You seem to be in the habit of losing 
		them fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the 
		amputee lifestyle just suits you.

	The other vampires laugh. Quinn stares them into silence. 

				QUINN
		We need to find him, tonight.

	Frost claps a hand on Quinn's shoulder.

				FROST
		Down, boy. Blade's not going anywhere. 
		I promise. Right now, though, we've 
		more pressing business --
			(off Mercury's look)
		It's time Dragonetti paid the piper. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Whistler studies Karen, exhaling another lungful of smoke.

				WHISTLER
		Blade's unique, you know. A one in a 
		billion anomaly. He can withstand 
		sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he 
		still has the Thirst. 

				KAREN
		What happens if he doesn't take the 
		serum?

				WHISTLER
		The Thirst overcomes him, just like 
		the others. It's not something he can 
		control. 
			(sighs)
		The problem is, time's running out. 
		His body's starting to reject the 
		serum. And so far, all my efforts to 
		find a cure have ended in failure --

				KAREN
		No offense, Whistler, but you're not 
		exactly working with state of the art 
		equipment here. You might have missed 
		something.

				WHISTLER
			(pointedly)
		Which is why you're here. We could use 
		someone with your experience.

	A beat passes between them and Karen knows where she stands now. In
	for a penny, in for a pound. Whistler reaches for Blade's sword.

				WHISTLER
		This used to be mine, you know. It's 
		been passed down through the 
		centuries, from one hunter to the 
		next --

	Whistler extends the sword, sighting down the length of it. He takes
	a few practice parries -- it's obvious he used to be quite skilled in
	the art of swordsmanship.

				KAREN
		Why do you hunt them?

				WHISTLER
		Habit, mostly, just like this. 

	Whistler gestures with his cigarette. He finally stubs it out, his
	wistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke.

				WHISTLER
		I had a family once -- a wife, three 
		daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon 
		Frost came calling one evening --

				KAREN
		He killed them?

				WHISTLER
		Eventually. He toyed with them first. 
		He made me choose, do you understand? 
		Which order they would die in --

	Karen stares at Whistler, horrified.

				KAREN
		How did you escape?

				WHISTLER
		I didn't. He was cruel enough to let 
		me live.
			(slapping his brace)
		Even gave me a souvenir to remember 
		him by.

	Karen nods -- it's all falling into place for her now.

				KAREN
		And now you're using Blade to exact 
		your revenge?

				WHISTLER
			(pointedly)
		Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and 
		I'm not getting any younger, am I?

	Just then, we hear a SCREAM come from Blade's room, sounding more
	like the cry of a beast than a man. Karen takes a step towards
	Blade's room --

				WHISTLER
		I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
		It's best to leave him alone when he's 
		like this.

				KAREN
		I'll take my chances.

	INT. BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Karen enters. It's dark, just a trace of moonlight.

				KAREN
		Blade?

	No answer. Then Karen SEES him -- crouched in the corner of the room
	like some kind of nocturnal animal.

				KAREN
		It's dark in here.

				BLADE
		You get used to the darkness.

	Karen takes a step towards him.

				KAREN
		Whistler told me about your mother. 

	Blade clutches the silver locket in his hand. It swings back and
	forth, like a pendulum.

				BLADE
		I can't close my eyes without hearing 
		her scream.

				KAREN
		Those aren't real memories. No one has 
		that kind of recall.

				BLADE
		I do. I remember from day one. People 
		staring at me, sensing I was 
		different. Watching the fear grow in 
		their eyes, knowing in their hearts I 
		wasn't human.

				KAREN
		If you're not human, then why do you 
		bleed like us? 
		I've seen vampire blood, you don't 
		have it running through your veins.

	Blade looks at Karen, his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight.

				BLADE
		Just get out of here.

				KAREN
		Blade --

	Blade turns, his eyes glowing with preternatural fury. 

				BLADE
		I said, GET OUT!!!

	Karen backs away, startled by Blade's vehemence. She exits, leaving
	him alone with his demons. He holds up one of his empty serum
	ampoules, crushing it in his fist.

				FROST'S VOICE
		Rise and shine, little wing.

	EXT. THE BURNING GROUNDS - JUST BEFORE DAWN

	FADE IN on Dragonetti, his face covered with a black condemned man's
	hood --

	Frost stands before him, grinning like the Cheshire Cat. He's dressed
	from head to toe in a black motorcycle suit -- boots, gloves, a
	visored helmet tucked under one arm. Mercury and Quinn are standing
	nearby, similarly attired. 

	We're on a stretch of rocky coastline, tucked away in a secluded
	cove. Dragonetti has been stripped bare, chained like Prometheus to
	an ancient standing stone. 

				DRAGONETTI
			(straining)
		What is this? Where am I?!

	Frost steps forward, pulling Dragonetti's hood off. Dragonetti stares
	at his surroundings, horrified.

				FROST
		When was the last time you stopped to 
		appreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti? 
		Three, four hundred years? 

	Frost checks his watch, then looks to the ocean. On the horizon, a
	sliver of gold appears. 

				FROST
		How do you like that? Right on time.

				DRAGONETTI
			(snarling)
		The other elders will never let you 
		get away with this!

	Just then, the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS emerge behind Frost, forming a
	circle around Dragonetti. All wear business suits, gloves, along with
	high-tech "sun masks" to protect their faces from the light's lethal
	rays. 

	They stare at Dragonetti like a silent jury. His face darkens, anger
	rising -- but there's a desperation in his eyes now too. He speaks in
	the secret tongue:

				DRAGONETTI
			(subtitled)
		Don't you see, you fools?! He'll 
		betray you too! He's planning on 
		invoking LaMagra himself!

	The vampires just smile and shake their heads.

				FROST
		The wheel turns, old fang. Guess you 
		just got a little too long in the 
		tooth.

	Dragonetti's cries are cut short as Frost forces the aging vampire's
	mouth open, ripping out his fangs with his bare hands. Dragonetti
	GURGLES and SHRIEKS, sounding like a dying animal.

	Frost turns to face the Twelve now, his eyes bright with victory. He
	pulls on his motorcycle helmet, as do Mercury and Quinn. 

	Behind them, Dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no
	avail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him, channeled
	inward by the natural formation of the cove -- 

	Dragonetti HOWLS, his skin beginning sizzle and smoke. Then he
	catches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass. He thrashes about
	as his flesh starts to run from his body.

	THE VAMPIRE ELDERS

	watch, impassive, protected by their masks --

	-- when suddenly, TWELVE FIGURES rise up behind them, clad in bike
	helmets and black leather, just like Frost. The intruders grip each
	of the Elders in a strangle hold, ripping their masks off. 

				FROST
		Dragonetti was right. You were fools 
		to trust me.

	Frost flips down the visor of his helmet even as --

	THE RED SUN

	rises in all its fiery glory.

	One by one, the vampire Elder's heads catch fire, skullflesh sizzling
	away -- burning down the line of them in successively building
	intensity until all twelve EXPLODE in a conflagration of BLINDING
	WHITE LIGHT.

	Frost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer
	intensity of the occult blast -- a blast which sends the skeletal
	bodies of the Elders SLAMMING into the rock wall.

	When it's over, Frost picks himself back up. We SEE that the only
	thing left of Dragonetti and the others are --

	THIRTEEN SHADOW SILHOUETTES

	permanently etched onto the rock's surface, just like the bombing
	victims of Hiroshima. 

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Karen stands at a lab table with Whistler, preparing a number of
	blood sample vials. They are surrounded by host of new medical
	equipment -- from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond.

	Blade emerges from his room, looks to Karen. As if by silent
	agreement, last night's words go unacknowledged. He straps on his
	bandoleer of stakes, secures his scabbard.

				WHISTLER
		Going somewhere?

				BLADE
		China Town. I need more serum.
			(re: new equipment)
		What's all this?

				KAREN
		I made a trip to the hospital last 
		night, borrowed some equipment.

				BLADE
			(sarcastic)
		For your miracle cure? 

				WHISTLER
		She's been making real progress, 
		Blade.
			(to Karen)
		Show him --

	Karen looks to Blade, who shrugs. She opens a refrigerator, removing
	a syringe filled with blue fluid.

				KAREN
		This is sodium citrate. It's an 
		anti-coagulant. We use it to treat 
		blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood 
		is thinner than humans, though. Watch 
		what happens when I introduce some 
		into a sample --

	Karen gestures to the microscope. Blade takes a look --

	BLADE'S POV

	Vampire blood cells swirling about.

	Karen injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells --
	the reaction is immediate. The vampire blood turns black, then begins
	violently bubbling.

	Blade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time -- the
	blood on the slide atomizes, exploding outward in a fine mist which
	bursts apart the glass lens of the scope. 

	Whistler laughs, thrilled with the results.

				WHISTLER
		Can you imagine what a dash of that 
		would do on your sword? 

	Whistler claps his hand on Karen's shoulder in approval, then limps
	away, quickly busying himself with another project. Blade moves to
	follow, but Karen stops him --

				KAREN
		Before you go, I'd like to take a 
		sample of your blood.

	Blade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve. As Karen takes her sample,
	Blade looks to Whistler. The older man brings a handkerchief to his
	lips, coughing into it. 

				KAREN
		Is he sick?

				BLADE
		Cancer.

	Karen watches as Blade's blood flows into the vacutainer. She fills
	the first, then inserts another. 

				KAREN
		You care about him, don't you? 

				BLADE
		We've got a good arrangement, that's 
		all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use 
		them, the vampires die -- end of 
		story.

	Karen finishes. Blade rolls up his sleeve.

				KAREN
			(pointedly)
		My mother used to say that a cold 
		heart is a dead heart.

				BLADE
		Your mother sounds like a Hallmark 
		greeting card. 

	Blade slips his Casulls into a shoulder holster, then shrugs into his
	leather jacket, donning his sunglasses.

				BLADE
		I'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never 
		put much stock in optimism.

	He heads towards the elevator.

	EXT. CHINATOWN, STREETS - DAY

	Blade makes his way down a street lined with vending stalls --
	passing MERCHANTS peddling exotic vegetables and cheap curios,
	butcher shops with rows of roast ducks in the window, tyro GANG-
	BANGERS lounging at the entrance to a video arcade.

	BLADE'S POV

	Even though the streets are crowded, the people seem to make way for
	him, avoiding eye-contact. 

	Blade turns into a dark alley, ducking into the doorway of a hole-in-
	the-wall herbalist shop.

	INT. HERBALIST SHOP - DAY 

	A bell atop the door JINGLES, announcing Blade's arrival. We're in a
	dusty, cave-like room filled with baskets and bottle-lined shelves
	featuring things like "Toad Spleen Extract" and "Barking Deer Wine".
	Joss sticks burn, sending wispy tendrils of incense into the air. 

	At the back of the shop, an elderly CHINESE MAN in a cardigan sits in
	front of a battered television, watching a boxing match. He's eating
	a bowl of litchi fruit. On the counter nearby, a SPIDER MONKEY
	watches attentively. 

				BLADE
		How's it going, Kam?

				KAM
			(re: calendar)
		You're a week early.

				BLADE
		I was in the neighborhood.

	Kam sets his fruit bowl aside, leads Blade through a curtain into a
	back room.

	INT. HERBALIST SHOP, BACK ROOM - DAY

	Kam hands Blade a leather valise. He opens it -- its lined with tiny
	ampoules of scarlet-colored serum. Blade pulls one out, holds it up
	to the light.

				BLADE
		Whistler says I'm building up a 
		resistance to it.

				KAM
		I was afraid that might happen.

				BLADE
		Maybe it's time to start exploring 
		other alternatives.

				KAM
		There's only one alternative to the 
		serum.

	Blade nods. They both know what that "alternative" is. 

				BLADE
		Yeah. I know.

	Blade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket. 

				BLADE
		Thanks, Kam.
			(thinking)
		One other thing. Have you ever heard 
		of a vampire called the Sleeper?

	Kam shakes his head. Blade pulls out the parchment he took from
	Pearl.

				BLADE
		I found this in there archives. I need 
		to find someone who can read their 
		language. 

	Kam studies the parchment.

				KAM
		I've heard about a woman named 
		Miracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a 
		Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives 
		in that tent community down by the 
		city dump. I'm told she only sees 
		people at night. 

	Blade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains.

	EXT. CHINATOWN, STREET - DAY

	Blade emerges from the alley into the sunlight, then hears his name
	WHISPERED on the wind.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Blade.

	Blade spins, scanning his surroundings -- did he really hear his
	name, or was it just the wind?

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Blade.

	Again, the taunting voice calls him. Blade's gaze finally settles
	on --

	A MAN

	sitting on a bench in the deep shade, his face obscured by the
	Chinese newspaper he's reading. There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly
	beside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face. 

				MAN
		Afternoon, Blade.

	The man lowers his newspaper. It's Deacon Frost. He's wearing
	sunglasses, but otherwise, he's seemingly unprotected by the sun. 

	Blade reaches for his .454 -- 

				FROST
		Easy.

	Frost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. We see his claws
	extend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin.

				FROST
		Wouldn't want our little friend here 
		to wind up on the back of a milk 
		carton, would we? 

	Blade reluctantly lowers his hand. Frost smiles. He takes in a deep
	breath of air, savoring it. 

				FROST
		Beautiful day, isn't it? 

				BLADE
			(confused)
		How can you be out here?

				FROST
		I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical 
		research. We've developed a type of 
		sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a 
		few others things. 

	On closer examination we see that Frost is wearing a translucent
	lotion on his face. He touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of
	the lotion between his fingers.

				FROST
		It's not very effective in direct 
		sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, 
		of course, is to be like you, "the 
		Day-walker". 

				BLADE
		I don't buy it.

				FROST
		Why not? The future of our race runs 
		through your bloodstream. You've got 
		the best of both worlds, Blade. All of 
		our strengths and none of our 
		weaknesses.

				BLADE
		Maybe I don't see it that way.

				FROST
		Oh, so it's back to pretending we're 
		human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle 
		Tom routine. You can't keep denying 
		what you are. You're one of us, Blade. 
		You always have been.

				BLADE
		You're wrong.

				FROST
		Am I? You think the humans will ever 
		accept a half-breed like you? They 
		can't. They're afraid of you. 
			(pointedly)
		The humans fear us because we're 
		superior. They fear us because in 
		their hearts they know their race has 
		become obsolete.

	Frost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt. 

				FROST
		Look at them, just an endless stream 
		of cattle in a mad race to the 
		slaughterhouse. 

	Frost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. He
	smacks his lips, sighs contentedly --

				FROST
		The pause that refreshes --
			(offering it to Blade)
		Care for some? Smells good, doesn't 
		it? Pungent, with just an 
		irrepressible hint of iron. 

				BLADE
		Pass.

				FROST
		You sure now? I bled a newborn for 
		this. You won't find a drink that's 
		sweeter. 

	It takes every ounce of Blade's self-control to keep from attacking
	Frost -- and Frost senses this, pressing his sharp thumbnail against
	the child's jugular.

				FROST
		Tell me honestly, do you really get 
		the same rush from that pasteurized 
		piss-serum of yours?
			(off Blade's look)
		You're surprised I know about your 
		serum? You shouldn't be. I know 
		everything about you. 

	Frost leans forward, grinning.

				FROST
		You can't keep walking the razor's 
		edge, Blade. The day will come -- and 
		soon, when you'll have to choose 
		between our kind and their's. If I 
		were you, I'd take care not to wind up 
		on the wrong end of the fang.

	A bead of sweat runs down Frost's neck, washing away a minute amount
	of the sun-blocking cream. The patch of exposed skin instantly
	blackens. Frost gazes upwards at the sun.

				FROST
		Love to continue this chat, but it 
		appears I'm melting.

	Frost rises, taking the little girl by the hand. Blade follows, his
	hand resting on the butt of his Casull.

				BLADE
		You're not going anywhere.

				FROST
			(growling)
		Watch me.

	Frost's eyes flicker towards the street -- a CITY BUS is rumbling by.
	In a heartbeat, Frost hurls the little girl forward --

	-- out into the path of the oncoming bus! 

	Blade has a split-second to act. It's Frost or the girl -- and for a
	moment we actually think he's going to go for Frost --

	-- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms,
	throwing themselves out of the bus' path. The bus misses them by a
	hair. By the time Blade looks up again --

	-- Frost is gone. Blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as
	market-goers gather around him.

	WHIP PAN TO --

	SOMEONE sitting astride a motorcycle, watching Blade from the roof of
	an elevated parking garage. The rider is clad from head to toe in a
	helmet and black leather -- Mercury. 

	EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

	Blade's Olds cruises into the gated grounds. It zips down the ramp
	way into the loading elevator.

	BACK BY THE TRAIN TRACKS --

	Mercury's cycle rolls into frame. She picks up a radio handset and
	keys it.

				MERCURY
			(into radio)
		This is Mercury. Tell Deacon I've 
		found their hiding place.

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

	Blade enters through the loading elevator, finding Karen and Whistler
	hard at work. She turns as he approaches -- SEES him back-lit by the
	sun. She looks pale, the whites of her eyes are streaked with red.

				BLADE
		Any progress?

				KAREN
		Some. It's been slow --

				BLADE
		You don't look so good. 

				KAREN
		I'm just tired, that's all. We've been 
		up all night.

	Blade nods, not buying her explanation. He shoots a glance to
	Whistler, which doesn't go unnoticed by Karen.

				KAREN
		Excuse me.

	Karen turns, heading for the back of the workshop.

	INT. WORKSHOP - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Karen enters a dingy bathroom, turning on the overhead bulb. She
	studies her reflection in the mirror above the sink, then grimaces as
	she peels the dressing from her wound -- the wound is clearly
	infected, gangrenous. 

				BLADE (O.S.)
		It's started.

	Karen spins, startled. Blade stands behind her. He grips her jaw,
	turning her head so he can better view the wound.

				BLADE
		You've got another day or two at most.

	Karen nods, shaken. As she moves to leave, Blade reaches for her arm,
	stopping her.

				BLADE
		For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

				KAREN
		You make it sound like I'm already 
		dead.

	Blade just stares at her. Finally, she pulls away.

	EXT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DUSK

	CLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the
	sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - DUSK

	Windy. Urban desolation. Blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling
	cardboard and plywood squatter's ghetto which has sprung up around
	the city dump. CHILDREN and DOGS forage for salvageable items, while
	in the distance, dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse.

	MOMENTS LATER,

	Blade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and
	ashcan fires. A CROWD quickly closes in around him, suspicious. A
	BRUTISH MAN steps forward, challenging him --

				MAN
		Extranjero. ¿Quien es?

				BLADE
		I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.

	The man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated
	debate, a GAUNT WOMAN steps forward, motioning --

				WOMAN
		This way.

	CUT TO:

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Whistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood
	smear slide through a microscope. 

				KAREN
		All right, let's start with the basics 
		-- why do vampires need to drink 
		blood?

				WHISTLER
		Their own blood can't sustain 
		hemoglobin. 

				KAREN
		Then vampirism is a genetic defect, 
		just like Hemolytic anemia?

	Whistler nods.

				KAREN
		So what about gene therapy?

	Whistler looks intrigued. Karen continues.

				KAREN
		Basically you'd have to re-write the 
		victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA 
		will produce proteins capable of 
		generating hemoglobin. 

				WHISTLER
		How?

				KAREN
		With a retrovirus. It's injected into 
		the bone marrow cells, it causes the 
		host's DNA to mutate. They've been 
		using them to treat Sickle-cell 
		anemia. 

	Whistler can hardly believe what he's hearing.

				WHISTLER
		You're serious? You actually think 
		this could work?

	Karen pauses -- we can see in her expression that there's something
	she's been holding back.

				KAREN
		On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so 
		sure -- 
			(gravely)
		The problem is, Blade didn't contract 
		the vampire virus from a bite like I 
		did. He was born with it. The irony 
		is, I could probably cure every 
		vampire but him.

				WHISTLER
		Then we're back to square one, aren't 
		we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always 
		wins.

	At that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out.
	Karen looks around the room, alarmed. 

				KAREN
		What happened to the power?

				WHISTLER
			(concerned)
		I don't know, but the back-up 
		generator should've kicked in.

	A few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated.
	Whistler moves to the window --

				WHISTLER
		UV floodlights are down too.

	As Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS
	SHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines
	the flashlight in that direction. We hear more sounds now -- water
	draining, glass tinkling.

	Whistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges
	towards the black-out curtains, Karen falling in behind him.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - TANK ROOM - NIGHT

	Whistler and Karen enter, cautious --

	THE TANK

	containing the vampire child has been smashed open. It's empty now,
	with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a
	widening pool -- and a trail of tiny BLOODY FOOTPRINTS leading back
	out into the main workshop.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

	Karen scans the shadows, eyes alert. We hear a WHISPER, then a
	teasing, childish, GIGGLE.

	Whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over
	every inch of the room. And just as he's about to complete his
	circuit --

	THE CHILD

	leaps from where it had been hiding overhead! Karen SCREAMS.
	Whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his
	hand --

	The feral child lands atop Whistler, HISSING like a cobra. Its
	macrocephalic head seems to morph, twisting into grotesque
	proportions. And just as it's about to strike --

	ZZZZING! Whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden
	inside his cane. He lunges forward --

	WHOOSH! The child takes off like a blue streak, sending test tubes
	and medical equipment CRASHING to the floor. It zips past Karen --

				WHISTLER
		Get it!!!

	Karen snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as Whistler
	struggles to his feet --

	Karen sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses
	of the child as it darts through the workshop. She reaches a shelving
	unit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified
	pistols --

	Karen tries to draw a bead on the creature. She FIRES, misses, FIRES
	again -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the
	creature is moving closer and --

	-- suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs
	bared! 

	The child knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat,
	sinking its claws into her neck. Karen chokes, forcing Whistler's
	pistol under the monstrosity's chin --

	-- but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific
	little cherubim of a child -- and Karen hesitates, because the child
	seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and
	hypnotic and --

	-- suddenly Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire
	child's head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature
	slumps --

	Karen cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it
	continues to writhe --

	THUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally
	decapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded.

				WHISTLER
		Understand this -- they are monsters. 
		Hesitate for even a moment, and you've 
		lost.

				FROST (O.S.)
		Words to live by, Whistler.

	Whistler spins, eyes wide. He knows that voice.

	DEACON FROST

	steps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight,
	followed by Mercury and Quinn. 

				FROST
		It's been a long time, hasn't it, "old 
		friend"? 

	EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - MIRACIA'S CABIN - NIGHT

	Blade is led to a plywood cabin crowded with candle-lit altars --
	garish pictures of Saints and demons abound, alongside bottles of
	roots and herbs steeped in alcohol, human bones, voodoo dolls. 

	MIRACIA 

	sits on a sagging couch outside, clutching a deck of well-thumbed
	Bicycle playing cards. She's ancient, with a mouthful of gold-capped
	teeth and cataract-clouded eyes. Blind.

				MIRACIA
		Is something wrong, my friend?

				BLADE
		You're blind --

				MIRACIA
		There are other ways to see. Sit.

	Blade approaches, uneasy. Miracia deals out the playing cards on a
	rickety table, setting them in nine piles which take on a cross
	formation. 

				MIRACIA
		Perhaps you have brought me something 
		-- an offering for the orishas?

	Blade tosses a handful of bills on the table. Miracia nods, then
	flips over the first card in the center pile -- a one-eyed Jack. She
	sighs, grave --

				MIRACIA
		Hold out your hands.

				BLADE
		I didn't come here to get my palms 
		read. I need something translated.

				MIRACIA
		Show me.

	Blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the
	table. Miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper, touching
	her fingertips to her lips.

				MIRACIA
		Sangre. Written in blood. 

	She runs her hands over each line as if it were written in Braille.
	Some of the candles gutter, then extinguish themselves as the wind
	around them rises.

				MIRACIA
		This is an old tongue, from an old 
		world. It concerns LaMagra.

				BLADE
		Who is LaMagra?

				MIRACIA
		The vampire God. This speaks of His 
		return.

	Miracia's fingers search the parchment again.

				MIRACIA
		"-- there will come a Day Walker."
			(reading)
		"His blood will call the Sleeper from 
		beyond the Veil of Tears."

	Blade stares at Miracia, shaken.

				BLADE
		His blood -- ?

	The old woman nods, reaching for a smoldering cigarette.

				MIRACIA
		The Day Walker's blood is a disparador 
		-- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's 
		return. One need only consume it and 
		the spirit of his ancestors will 
		settle upon him.
			(reading)
		"And the Sleeper will rise from the 
		shadows anew, cleansing the world in a 
		Tide of Blood."

				BLADE
			(recalling the phrase)
		"The Blood Tide".

				MIRACIA
			(nodding)
		Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is 
		said that all who feel its taint will 
		succumb to the Thirst. 

				BLADE
		How do I stop it?

	Miracia shrugs, spreading her hands.

				MIRACIA
		The Great Wheel turns, my friend. The 
		Dark is rising. How would you fight a 
		shadow? 

	Miracia sits back, slumping into her chair. The candles have burnt
	themselves down to nothing. 

				MIRACIA
		I am tired. Dawn is coming. 

				BLADE
		But I just got here --

				MIRACIA
		You've been here longer than you 
		think. 

	Blade rises, looking to the horizon. Incredibly, dawn is coming. As
	he stands there, mystified, the wind picks up, sweeping the parchment
	fragment out of his hand. He tries to snatch it back, but the
	fragment is quickly borne away. He watches it disappear into the sky,
	then turns back --

	Miracia is gone. Blade glances around him, but she's nowhere to be
	found. 

	CAMERA PULLS BACK,

	isolating Blade amidst the ghostly squalor. From our vantage point,
	he looks like any other homeless phantom.

	INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

	Blade steps out from the elevator into the workshop --

	The place has been trashed. It looks like a tornado touched down in
	his absence. Blade pulls out one of his .454s, cautious --

				BLADE
		WHISTLER?!

	-- and then he stops dead in his tracks.

	WHISTLER

	has been strung up by his arms against the far wall, tortured and
	left for dead. In response to Blade's voice, a MOAN escapes the dying
	man's lips.

	Blade rushes to the wall, cutting Whistler down with his sword,
	gently lowering him to the floor. As he cradles the old man in his
	arms, Blade sees the primary wound -- two ragged puncture marks along
	Whistler's throat.

				BLADE
		Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to 
		you?

	Whistler opens his eyes, struggling to speak --

				WHISTLER
		Frost took her --

	Whistler spasms and coughs, wincing from the pain.

				BLADE
		Don't try to talk --

				WHISTLER
		Listen. You have to -- finish me off. 
		You don't want me coming back.

				BLADE
		No, we can treat the wounds --

	But Whistler is shaking his hand.

				WHISTLER
		Too far gone, you know that.

	Blade's at a complete loss.

				BLADE
		Whistler, I can't.

	Whistler clutches at Blade's arm, his eyes burning with conviction.

				WHISTLER
		Yes you can. Now get on with it. 

	As much as he'd like to deny it, Blade knows that Whistler is right.
	He pulls a stake from his bandoleer, hesitates.

				BLADE
		Whistler, I --

				WHISTLER
			(cutting him off, more gentle now)
		I know. 
			(forcing a smile)
		Just be quick about it, will you? Do 
		it right.

	Blade fights back tears. With a wretched moan, he turns his head and
	drives the stake into Whistler's chest. Whistler GASPS. Blade wraps
	his arms around the older man, holding him tight as the life runs out
	of him, rocking back and forth --

	After a while, the rocking stops and Blade lays Whistler on the
	floor. Then something catches his eye --

	A SHARP VIEW-CAMCORDER

	resting nearby, labeled, "PLAY ME". Blade reaches for the camcorder,
	cues the tape -- Frost's face appears on the tiny built-in screen.

				FROST
		Hello, Blade. By the time you watch 
		this, Whistler will no doubt be 
		winging his way to Heaven, thanks to 
		your capable hands. If it makes any 
		difference to you, he put up quite a 
		fight.

	Frost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek.

				FROST
		Now, I'm sure you're wondering about 
		Ms. Jansen's well-being. She's alive 
		and kicking -- "ambulatory", as they 
		like to say in the trade. Whether or 
		not she remains so is entirely up to 
		you.
			(beat)
		I'll make this as easy as possible for 
		you, Blade. You can find us at the 
		Edgewood Towers. We'll be waiting with 
		baited breath.

	The tape cuts to static. Blade throws the camcorder against the wall.
	It shatters into a dozen pieces.

	Blade turns now, his eyes falling on the medical equipment Karen
	brought from the hospital. He moves to the refrigerator, removing a
	canister labeled "SODIUM CITRATE". Then he draws his sword. We can
	practically see the wheels turning within his mind --

	MOMENTS LATER,

	Blade stands before the open flames of one of the furnaces, heating
	his sword in the fire. He withdraws it -- it's molten red.

	Blade turns, dousing the molten hot sword into the sodium citrate
	canister. The refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat, causing the
	sword to STEAM and HISS.

	When Blade withdraws the smoking sword, we SEE that the gleaming
	steel has changed colors, taking on a bluish tinge, just like the
	sodium citrate it was immersed in. Blade smiles to himself,
	satisfied.

	CUT TO:

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, INNER CHAMBER - DAY

	Sparse decor in a Neo-Japanese vein. Minimalist lighting. The walls
	are glass. Recirculating pumps send a constant stream of water
	cascading down them.

	Karen is escorted into the room by Mercury. She gestures to a chair
	at the end of a long table. Karen sits. 

	FROST 

	leans forward out of the shadows, resting his elbows on the table,
	hands steepled together. 

				FROST
		Well, here we are, Doctor.

	A cigarette appears in Frost's hand. In the blink of an eye, the
	cigarette is lit, burning. The movements are so quick we barely have
	time to register them. 

				KAREN
		Why haven't you killed me yet? 

				MERCURY
		Deacon likes to play with his food 
		before he eats it.

	Frost laughs. Karen tries to keep calm. The longer she keeps them
	talking, the longer she remains alive.

				KAREN
		How many of you are there?

				FROST
		A few thousand scattered about the 
		globe. In the past, we've had to 
		restrict our numbers for fear of 
		discovery. That won't be necessary 
		after tonight. 

				KAREN
		What happens then?

				FROST
		The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied 
		holy war against the humans. There's a 
		force, you see -- a spirit that exists 
		in our blood. I've discovered a way to 
		invoke it.

				KAREN
		LaMagra --

				FROST
		That's right. The answers were there 
		all along, of course, scribbled down 
		in the forgotten languages of my kind. 
		Waiting for someone with the patience 
		to decipher them. 
		My elders were foolish enough to 
		dismiss them as wives tales. But I 
		knew better. 
			(beat)
		Imagine my surprise when Blade turned 
		out to be the key which would set that 
		force free. 

	Frost sits forward now, impassioned.

				FROST
		LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a 
		spirit, requiring a flesh and blood 
		host in order to manifest himself.

				KAREN
		You.

				FROST
		Who better to usher in the Blood Tide? 

	Karen shakes her head, protesting --

				KAREN
		There's no need for any of this. Your 
		condition can be treated. Whistler and 
		I were working on a cure when --

				FROST
		What makes you think we want to be 
		cured? Blood is only part of the 
		equation. The hunt, the killing, 
		that's what the Thirst is really 
		about.

				KAREN
		But you use blood banks --

				FROST
		Only as a last resort. Preserved blood 
		is inferior. There's no flavor left to 
		it, no life. 
			(rising from his seat)
		Fortunately, I've found a way around 
		that particular obstacle. 

	Frost moves to the end of the room. He pushes a button. With a HUM
	the wall slides open, revealing something Karen wishes she'd never
	seen -- living blood banks.

	THREE SEDATED HUMANS

	have been hooked up to IV feeds which replenish various nutrients as
	their blood is drained from them. Shunts have been implanted in their
	forearms which serve as taps. 

				FROST
		Under these conditions I can keep a 
		donor alive for years, producing 
		anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints 
		of blood.
			(admiring his charges)
		Of course, this is just a pilot 
		program, really. Once the Tide comes, 
		we'll need to expand production. So 
		many more mouths to feed -- 

	Karen turns away, overwhelmed by revulsion. 

				KAREN
		You're a monster.

				FROST
		Why? Because we live at another 
		species' expense? Your people farm 
		cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening 
		them up with steroids? It's called 
		evolution, Doctor. Survival of the 
		fittest. 

	Frost stares at Karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze. 

				FROST
		I have a wake-up call for the human 
		race. You're no longer at the top of 
		the food chain.

	EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - DAY

	BLADE'S POV

	A telephoto view of Frost's penthouse. The windows are polarized,
	blocking out the sun's harsh rays.

	Blade lowers a pair of binoculars. He's standing on the roof of a
	building across the street. He hefts an air-launcher rifle up into
	firing position --

	BANG! An iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air
	between the two buildings, sinking into the concrete facade of
	Frost's penthouse. Blade secures his end of the rope. He slips a
	pulley over the rope, grabs hold of two handles, and leaps off the
	roof ledge!

	WHOOSH! Blade slides towards Frost's penthouse, a good twenty stories
	above street level. A second before he reaches the windows, Blade
	lets go. Momentum sends him CRASHING through in a shower of glass.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	An ALARM is ringing. Sunlight streams in through the broken window.
	TWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light
	are burning up before our eyes. Blade climbs to his feet --

	A THIRD VAMPIRE

	leaps at him. Blade spins, flipping the vampire over his shoulder,
	sending him straight through one of the other windows --

	EXT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	The vampire tumbles earthward, SCREAMING as the sun's rays ignite his
	body, falling like a human comet.

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

	Blade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall --

	INT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY

	To Blade's right is the inner chamber with the "waterfall" walls. As
	ANOTHER VAMPIRE approaches, Blade readies his sword --

				VAMPIRE
		You think I'm afraid of that toothpick 
		of yours?

				BLADE
		You should be. I've made some 
		improvements.

	And with that, Blade thrusts his blackened sword forward, right
	through the vampire's chest. 

	The creature SHRIEKS and atomizes -FWOOSH!- flying apart in a fine-
	beaded spray of blood mist. 

	Up ahead are a set of steel doors with a time-lock mechanism. Blade
	draws a Casull, BLASTS away at the lock, then shoulders the doors
	open --

	INT. FROST'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - DAY

	We are in a windowless, vault-like room dominated by a series of
	high-tech STAINLESS STEEL SARCOPHAGI. Think of a hyperbaric coffin, 
	each unit possessing a small face-plate window through which the 
	sleeping subject can be viewed.

	Blade unsheathes his sword. He grabs the lid of the first
	sarcophagus, HEAVING upward. With a PNEUMATIC HISS, the lid rises,
	belching out a cloud of condensation mist. 

	As the mist clears, revealing the occupant within, Blade raises his
	sword, ready to plunge it downward -- only it's not Deacon Frost who
	rests beneath him, it's --

	VANESSA,

	Blade's mother!!! Although some thirty years have passed since the
	events of our prologue, Vanessa looks exactly the same -- vibrant,
	beautiful, full of life. Her eyes open.

				VANESSA
		Jason. 

	Blade gasps, uncomprehending.

				BLADE
		Mother -- ?!

	Vanessa rises from the sarcophagus, tears staining her cheeks.

				VANESSA
		I've missed you so much, Jason. 
			(drawing closer)
		You have no idea what I've been 
		through, how much I've wanted to see 
		you -- 

	Blade falters, his mind reeling. What he's seeing is incomprehensible
	-- his mother is dead. Yet, here she is in the flesh, reaching out to
	him and --

	-- flashing a mouthful of viper-like fangs! She SNARLS and strikes,
	brutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword
	from his grasp --

	A TRIO OF BLACK-CLAD VAMPIRES

	led by Mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all
	along. They're armed with tasers which they fire en masse --

	Blade is hit by the taser darts from all sides. He writhes as
	electricity courses through him, then collapses in a heap. He labors
	to lift his head, looking up at Vanessa -- 

				BLADE
		But you -- died --

				VANESSA
			(a hellish smile)
		Deacon brought me back. 

				BLADE
		Fight him --

	As if on cue, Frost appears at Vanessa's side, wrapping a proprietary
	arm about her waist, kissing the nape of her neck. She leans into him
	-- an act of practiced intimacy.

				FROST
		She can't. She's one of my thralls 
		now. She has about as much free will 
		as a puppet on a string.
			(looking at Vanessa)
		You love me, don't you, Vanessa? 

				VANESSA
		Yes.

	Frost kisses Vanessa hungrily. Then he kneels and reaches into
	Blade's jacket, retrieving a vial of Blade's serum.

				FROST
		What do we have here? Your precious 
		serum? I don't think you'll be needing 
		this anymore.

	Frost crushes the vial in his fist. Blade struggles to reach Frost,
	stretching a palsied hand upwards --

				BLADE
		Please -- 

				VANESSA
		Listen to your father, Jason. It's 
		going to be a better world.

	Blade stares at Vanessa uncomprehending. 

				FROST
		Don't look so surprised, Blade. You've 
		spent your life looking for the 
		vampire who fathered you. Well you can 
		rest easy now, you've found him.
			(gripping Blade's chin)
		Daddy's here.

	Blade's eyes widen in shock. Frost simply laughs.

				FROST
		It's true, Blade. You've got my blood 
		running through your veins.
			(smiling)
		Thirty years ago. A moonlit street, a 
		woman on her way home alone. You were 
		conceived the night I tore my fangs 
		into your mother's flesh. 

	Frost swings his fist into Blade's skull. Everything goes black. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

	FADE IN as Blade opens his eyes, still groggy, his face beaded with
	sweat. Feverish. His hands have been bound tightly behind his back
	with manacles and chains. 

	KAREN

	sits nearby, watching him. From the steady rocking motion and the
	SOUNDS of traffic outside, it's evident that they are in the back of
	a moving truck.

				KAREN
		Are you all right?

				BLADE
			(weakly)
		I've been better --

				BLADE
		How long have we been driving?

				KAREN
			(shaking her head)
		I don't know. I woke up just before 
		you did --

	As he struggles to sit up, she crosses over to him. Blade shuts his
	eyes for a moment, fighting a wave of pain.

				KAREN
		Is it bad?

				BLADE
			(nodding)
		We get out of this alive, maybe I'll 
		take that miracle cure of yours.

	Karen doesn't respond. Instead she looks away. How in the world is
	she supposed to tell him this?

				KAREN
			(quietly)
		It won't work on you.

				BLADE
		What are you talking about?

	Karen forces herself to meet his gaze.

				KAREN
		Your condition's congenital, the 
		genetic mutations occurred in utero. 
		All the other victims contracted 
		vampirism after birth. 

	Blade stares at Karen, disbelieving. Who could imagine a more
	horrifying irony? She's crying now. She can't help it.

				KAREN
		I can't cure you, Blade. I can cure 
		myself, but I can't cure you.
			(beat)
		I'm so sorry.

	Blade's head sinks, the last vestiges of hope draining out of him.

	And then, as if the final stake were being pounded in, the truck
	lurches to a stop. We hear the ENGINE being killed, then FOOTSTEPS
	approaching, and then a series of BOLTS BEING SHIFTED as --

	-- the back of the truck is thrown open. Frost stands there,
	grinning, flanked by Mercury, Quinn, Vanessa, and a half-dozen other
	VAMPIRE ASSOCIATES. 

				FROST
		Welcome home, children.

	EXT. THE BANK OF EREBUS - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen are dragged from the back of the truck, which is
	revealed now to be an armored car. 

	THE BANK OF EREBUS

	rises up before them. A towering beaux-arts edifice situated in the
	heart of the city's high-priced financial district -- one of the many
	institutions owned and operated by the vampire enclave.

	Frost starts up the marble steps towards a grand, triple-arched
	entrance flanked by Corinthian columns. Karen and Blade are dragged
	along after him. 

	INT. BANK OF EREBUS - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	Frost leads his vampires into a high-ceilinged atrium, moving towards
	a bank of elevators -- one of the doors of which is outfitted with a
	high-tech hand-key ID system.

	Frost places his palm on the ID screen. The screen GLOWS GREEN,
	acknowledging his identity. In response, the doors HISS open.

	INT. SECURITY ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Blade and Karen are pulled inside the elevator. The control panel
	buttons have vampire glyphs, rather than numbers. Frost presses the
	bottom one. The doors close with a WHOOSH and the car descends --
	down, down, down.

	Frost glances over at Karen, smiling amiably.

				FROST
		On its surface, this building houses 
		one of the city's oldest financial 
		institutions -- and for over 
		two-hundred years its served our 
		corporate needs. Look beneath the 
		surface, however, and you'll discover 
		another truth entirely --

	The elevator CHIMES, having arrived at its destination. The doors
	HISS open, revealing 

	INT. THE TEMPLE OF NIGHT 

	A vast, barrel-vaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches
	out before us -- an underground cathedral of sorts, wrought from
	alabaster and marble. Restrained. Elegant. Replete with dark
	splendor.

				FROST
		As above, so below.

	Torches burn in wall sconces, casting everything in a warm, amber
	glow. Frost takes in the beauty of the place.

				FROST
		Welcome to our hall of ancients, 
		Doctor. We call it the Temple of 
		Night.

	Blade and Karen are led to the middle of the room, where a stone
	altar rises up from a dais. Blade is roughly thrown to the ground. He
	kneels there, eyes cast downward. Broken. His system being assaulted
	by the devastating effects of the Thirst. 

	Quinn and Mercury pick their way through Blade's discarded gear.
	Quinn picks up the punching dagger, admiring it. 

	Frost turns to Mercury, who's been holding Blade's scabbarded sword.

				FROST
		Let's see this sword of his.

	Mercury draws the sword, handing it to Frost. He sights down the
	length of it, testing its weight. With a flick of his wrist, he
	lashes out, slashing Blade's cheek open. 

				FROST
		Still quite sharp, I see.

	Blade feebly struggles to rise. Frost clubs him on the back of the
	neck with the sword pommel. Blade crumples. Karen tries to pull free,
	but Quinn holds her tight.

				KAREN
		Blade --

				FROST
		You're wasting your breath, woman. He 
		can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, 
		you see? It already has him in its 
		grip.

	Frost reaches down, dragging Blade's head up by his hair. Karen
	watches on as Frost continues to taunt him.

				FROST
		How long has it been since you had 
		your serum? Twelve hours? More? You 
		must be quite thirsty by now.

	He crouches down so he's eye to eye with Blade.

				FROST
		What does it feel like? Is your blood 
		on fire? Are you burning up inside? 
		Give in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace 
		your true nature.

	Blade shivers, grits his teeth, it's like he's going through heroin
	withdrawal. 

				BLADE
		-- go to hell --

	Frost smiles, his eyes burning with an infernal glow.

				FROST
		I've got news for you, Blade. We're 
		already here.

	Frost turns to the others, motioning.

				FROST
		Take him to the sanctuary. It's time 
		he was bled.

	The other vampires retreat, dragging Blade along with them. Karen is
	left alone with Frost and Quinn.

				FROST
		I'd let you watch the proceedings, 
		Doctor, but I'm afraid that privilege 
		is reserved for members of my own 
		race. Don't worry, though, I've made 
		alternate arrangements for you.

	Frost motions and Quinn drags Karen towards --

	THE MOUTH OF A PIT

	some forty feet deep, its lichen-encrusted stone walls worn smooth
	over time. As Frost gestures to the yawning darkness beneath them,
	Quinn forces Karen towards the edge. 

				FROST
		We call this the Bone Pit. It's where 
		we keep our mistakes, the ones who 
		couldn't successfully make the 
		transition from human to vampire. 

	Frost reaches out, caressing Karen's neck, puncturing the soft flesh
	beneath her chin with a razored fingernail.

				FROST
		They'll feed on anything, given the 
		chance -- animals, corpses, even other 
		vampires.

	Frost nods. Karen struggles against Quinn, but it's no good. In a
	manner of seconds, she's falling --

	INT. BONE PIT - NIGHT

	-- making a decidedly rough landing on a heap of bones far below. She
	GROANS, taking stock of her battered body.

	UP ABOVE,

	Deacon watches from the lip of the pit, amused. 

				FROST
		Of course, a strapping young woman 
		like yourself -- well I think you just 
		might be considered finger food.

	And with that, he's gone, stepping away from the pit.

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

	We are in a small, elevated antechamber which is situated above the
	main vampire sanctuary.

	BLADE, 

	now weakened to the point of collapse, is being lashed to a rack-like
	device by iron chains. 

	Mercury and her cohorts move efficiently, quickly securing him. When
	they are through, the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of
	winch-driven chains. 

	With every turn of the winch crank, the chains are drawn tighter,
	causing Blade to CRY OUT, until at last, he is suspended in mid-air,
	spread-eagle. 

	FROST

	approaches, still carrying Blade's sword.

				FROST
		It's been a long road, hasn't it? Such 
		a pity Whistler led you so far astray. 

	Frost cocks his head to the side, studying Blade's face.

				FROST
		I don't blame you, though. I want you 
		to know that. Even after all you've 
		done. I understand, Blade, I really 
		do. It's the human side of you which 
		has corrupted your reasoning, made you 
		weak. But we'll take care of that, 
		won't we?

	Blade struggles to lift his head, forcing himself to match Frost's
	gaze, shaking with hatred.

				BLADE
		I'd kill myself -- before I turned 
		into something like you.

	Frost just smiles and shakes his head.

				FROST
		No you wouldn't. I'm going to bleed 
		you dry, Blade. All the poison that 
		makes you human. 
			(drawing closer)
		When the Tide comes, you'll be begging 
		me put you through the Change. 

	Frost lifts up Blade's sword, methodically slitting Blade's wrists
	one by one. He makes the cuts lengthwise, opening up the cephalic and
	basilic veins with surgical precision.

	Blood wells up from the fresh wounds, running down Blade's forearms,
	collecting in a cistern beneath his feet. 

	Frost watches the steady, inexorable process, then nods, satisfied.
	He looks to the others who are gathered behind him, watching on with
	silent reverence.

				FROST
		It's done. We should ready ourselves 
		for the ritual of invocation.

	Frost leads Mercury, Quinn, and the others from the sanctuary.

	Blade struggles futilely against his bonds, crying out in
	frustration, his body eventually sagging from exhaustion. 

				VANESSA (O.S.)
		There's no use fighting us, Jason. 

	Blade looks up, focusing now on --

	VANESSA, 

	who has remained behind. Blade stares at her. As terrible as his
	physical torment is, his mother's betrayal is infinitely worse.

				BLADE
		How could you be a part of this?

				VANESSA
		These are my people now. I'm one of 
		them.

				BLADE
		You don't have to be. 

				VANESSA
		You don't understand. I've killed, 
		I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it. 

	She draws closer, caressing her son's face. There's just a hint of
	creepy eroticism in her action, a dash of incest. 

				VANESSA
		I wish you could see the world as I 
		do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no 
		turning back from that.

				BLADE
		I don't believe that.

				VANESSA
		You will. Time is on our side. Sooner 
		or later, the Thirst always wins.

	Vanessa turns away now. Blade cries after her --

				BLADE
		Mother!

	Vanessa pauses, looking back, smiling cruelly.

				VANESSA
		Your mother died the night you
		were born. 

	And with that, she's gone, melting into the shadows. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE BONE PIT - NIGHT 

	Karen rises, wary, taking in her shadowed surroundings. 

	HEAPS OF HUMAN BONES

	are piled against the pit walls -- skulls, rib-cages, femurs, tibias
	-- all picked clean of flesh. Some of the skulls have large, canine-
	like fangs -- the remnants, no doubt, of long-deceased vampires.

	Suddenly we hear a WHISPER of sorts, the soft CLINKING of bone
	fragments grinding together --

	Karen spins, trying to place the source of the sound. Then she hears
	the SOUND again. Behind her now, closer.

				REVENANT (O.S.)
		Karennnnn --

	Karen looks up with a growing sense of dread.

	A FACE

	emerges from the darkness. Pallid, cadaverous, shedding its
	desiccated flesh. Lidless eyes like black marbles slick with
	Vaseline. A mouth like a raw wound. 

				REVENANT
		Karreennnnnn. I never thought I'd see 
		you againnnnn.

	Karen backs away, realizing who she's standing before.

				KAREN
		Curtis?!

	What used to be Curtis SNARLS, knocking Karen back into the drift-
	pile of bones. It pins her to the ground, kneeling above her,
	gurgling through its gutted trachea.

				CURTIS REVENANT
		Tell, me, Karennn -- ever have second 
		thoughts -- about us?

	Karen SCREAMS, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it
	lunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a
	pathetic approximation of a French kiss.

	She fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur,
	blindly swinging it upward --

	CRACK! The blow shatters the Curtis-thing's jaw. It rears back,
	falling to the side. 

	Karen crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and
	again --

	CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it
	back until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head
	hangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it
	advances, dragging itself back up.

	Sobbing, Karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a
	makeshift dagger.

	Curtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. At the last moment,
	Karen ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into Curtis' chest --

	Curtis impales himself, right through the heart. For one split-
	second, his eyes widen in surprise --

	-- and then he goes into a death-spasm, vomiting up a spray of
	caustic vampire blood-bile, spattering Karen. She sinks to her knees,
	GASPING, as the thing that used to be Curtis shrivels up, melting
	away into burbling puddle.

	After a beat, Karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her
	hands over the lichen-slick surface, searching for a way out. The
	mortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling. 

	Karen looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs.
	She pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds,
	working as a makeshift piton.

	Karen reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the
	first. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two
	makeshift pitons. Again, they hold.

	Trembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging
	solely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she
	manages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another
	foot above the left.

	In this slow, torturous manner, Karen begins to climb her way up out
	of the pit.

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade hangs from his chains, head slack, eyes half-lidded and
	lusterless. His skin has grown ashen as his life's blood has been
	bled away.

	Mercury appears before him, accompanied by Quinn. She bends in close
	to kiss Blade lightly on the lips.

				MERCURY
		It won't be long now, lover. 

	Quinn draws alongside her, hefting Blade's punching dagger. He places
	it against Blade's throat, slowly applying pressure. At this point,
	Blade's too weak to even resist.

				QUINN
		We should finish him off.

				MERCURY
			(shaking her head)
		No. Deacon wants him turned.

	Quinn releases Blade, disgusted. 

				QUINN
		Fucking waste, if you ask me.

	As Mercury and Quinn exit, the CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the cistern
	beneath Blade's feet. We follow the blood which has collected there
	as it flows into a crude drain and --

	INT. SANCTUARY - NIGHT 

	-- emerges from the ceiling of the sanctuary below. The stream of
	blood is directed down the channels of a spiral column, where it
	finally pools into a waiting chalice.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	the sanctuary in full. A large circular chamber, the perimeter of
	which is lined with recessed alcoves housing the remains of the
	vampire ancients, set into the sanctuary walls like cells in a hive.

	DEACON FROST

	stands in the center of the chamber, allowing Vanessa to clothe him
	in ceremonial regalia -- gleaming, centuries-old armor. He pauses,
	kissing her hungrily.

	Having finished suiting up, he turns to face the vampires who have
	been faithful to his cause -- Mercury, Quinn, a host of others. A
	hush settles upon them. There's an excitement in the air, a sense
	that something remarkable is about to happen.

				FROST
		Tonight is the night we've waited our 
		entire lives for. Tonight, the 
		blood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the 
		world. Tonight, the Age of Man comes 
		to an end. 

	The vampires bellow out a CHORUS OF CHEERS, their voices resonating
	off the stone walls like thunder. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BONE PIT - NIGHT

	Karen's hands appear over the lip of the bone pit. She heaves herself
	up, collapsing onto the floor --

	-- but there's no time to rest. Even now she can hear the VAMPIRES
	CHEERING. She drags herself to her feet, letting the voices guide
	her.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Karen slips around a corner, guarded, searching. She SEES Blade
	strung up before her, seemingly lifeless.

	Karen studies the chains which bind Blade, following them back to
	their source at the winch. She releases the brake on the winch crank,
	sending the chains RATTLING down through the overhead pulleys which
	suspend them. 

	Blade crumples to the floor, lying still. Karen is at his side in an
	instant --

				KAREN
			(whispering, urgent)
		Blade.

	Blade's eyes flicker open, fixing on her. Inhuman. He's shaking
	like an alcoholic going into delirium tremens.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Vanessa hands Frost the chalice containing Blade's blood. He lifts it
	up for all to see. The vampires begin to chant en masse, some long-
	forgotten invocation in the vampire tongue.

				FROST
			(grinning, to himself)
		"And what rough beast, its hour come 
		round at last, slouches towards 
		Bethlehem to be born?"

	Frost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade tries to sit up, gripping Karen's wrist --

				BLADE
		Get out of here --

				KAREN
		I'm not leaving without you.

				BLADE
		You don't understand. The Thirst --

	He clutches his stomach, experiencing phenomenal pain.

				BLADE
			(gasping)
		-- tearing me -- apart.

				KAREN
		I know. Take some of my blood.

				BLADE
		No --

				KAREN
		It's the only way. You know that. 
		We'll never get out of here alive if 
		you don't.

	Blade suppresses a shudder. Simply keeping himself from attacking her
	takes every ounce of his resolve.

				BLADE
		I can't -- I won't be able to stop --

				KAREN
		Yes you will. The human side of you is 
		stronger. I know it is.

	Karen matches Blade's gaze, steeling herself. The truth is, she's
	terrified. 

	Blade stares back at her. At this moment, he wants what Karen is
	offering more than anything he's ever desired. And so he rises --

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Frost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force
	seizes his body. He throws his head back, eyes rolling to white,
	flinging the chalice aside.

	And as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch, we SEE the
	stone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder --
	as if some force within were trying to break free --

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Karen turns her head to the side, baring her neck, offering herself
	to Blade. Blade opens his mouth. His canines elongate. He lowers his
	head --

	-- and starts to feed. Karen involuntarily stiffens as Blade's teeth
	puncture her skin and we --

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Frost shakes, possessed by an unseen force. A wind picks up from
	nowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange
	HUMMING. 

	Suddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN. A WRAITH-LIKE SPIRIT rushes
	outward in a fountain of light, penetrating Frost's body.

	Then ANOTHER TOMB SPLITS APART. Then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER -- until a
	torrent of SPIRIT-WRAITHS are surging into Frost, buffeting him about
	like a scarecrow in a cyclone.

	Mercury, Vanessa, and the other vampires back away, apprehensive,
	humbled by what they're witnessing.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	Blade moans, sinking his teeth deeper. Karen's head rolls back. Her
	eyes open -- glassy, unseeing -- as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her. 

	She shudders, her breath quickening, falling into a synchronous
	rhythm with Blade's. Her fingers dig deep into his back, clawing
	downward, tearing into him -- 

	She's not Karen anymore -- she's a red blood cell, an erythrocyte,
	spinning in a river of plasma, roaring up Blade's femoral artery,
	racing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the
	deafening breath of God, which blots all other sounds out of
	existence and we're --

	CUTTING BACK AND FORTH NOW

	between Frost's transformation and Blade's, each of them growing
	stronger by the second, caught in an ever-increasing feedback loop of
	expanding energy until --

				BLADE
		NO!!!!

	Blade tears himself from Karen, his pulse racing as -- 

	CUT TO:

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	-- the invocation of LaMagra reaches critical mass. Frost is consumed
	by a hellish force, unable to withstand the onslaught of spirit
	energy any longer. 

	CUT TO:

	INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

	-- Karen clawing at Blade, tears streaming down her cheeks.

				KAREN
		Don't stop --

	But Blade grips her by her shoulders, shoving her back. Karen stares
	at Blade, wide-eyed, as if waking from a trance. She touches the raw
	wounds on her neck, shaken --

				KAREN
		My God --

	Blade rises to his full height. His strength has more than returned,
	it's been doubled by the infusion of real blood. And there's
	something else in his gaze now too -- an animal fury that was missing
	before. Blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness. 

				KAREN
			(hesitant)
		Are you -- all right?

	Blade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists, SNAPPING them apart
	like toys. He flexes his hands -- fingernails lengthening to tapered
	points. And he smiles, offering us a view of his canines, which have
	elongated into fangs.

				BLADE
			(near-demonic)
		Never been better.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	The aftermath. Smoke hangs heavy in the air, occluding the area where
	Frost had stood. As it dissipates, Mercury and the others creep
	forward, apprehensive --

				MERCURY
		Deacon?

	FROST

	stands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes.
	As he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes -- burning with an
	awesome, inner fire. 

				FROST
		No longer.

				BLADE (O.S.)
		Frost!!!

	All heads turn --

	BLADE 

	stands at the balcony overhead, Karen at his side. He leaps from it,
	somersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a
	predatory cat.

				BLADE
		Who dies first?

				FROST
			(growling, to the others)
		Take him.

	Quinn GROWLS, stepping forward, armed with Blade's punching dagger.
	He offers his second "new hand" up for view. 

				QUINN
		Grew another hand for you sweetmeat --
			(tossing the dagger to his new hand)
		-- and now I'm gonna kill you with it.

	Quinn charges. Blade meets the vampire head-on, dropping into a low
	kick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. He spins
	behind Quinn -- 

				BLADE
		Let's see if you can grow a new one
		of these!

	Blade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket
	sleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle-wire which he twists
	around Quinn's throat. 

	Blade tightens the wire, decapitating Quinn. The headless body
	staggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. Blade scoops up his
	punching dagger --

				BLADE
		Next?

	Mercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. Blade
	launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, SNAPPING
	its neck --

	Mercury has Blade's .454 Casulls. She aims them at him --

				MERCURY
		Have a taste of your own medicine!

	As she FIRES, Blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from
	her hand. The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up
	by --

	KAREN,

	who takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.

	Meanwhile, Blade traps Mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping
	her over his shoulder. He hefts his Casull, BLASTING her into
	eternity --

	A bloodbath ensues. Blade moves like speed-personified, FIRING off
	one, two, THREE HEADSHOTS with brain-numbing accuracy, cutting down
	the vampires where they stand. 

	It's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and
	-CLICK-CA-CHING-CLICK!- Blade and Karen have spent their bullets
	and --

				FROST (O.S.)
		Enough!!!

	Blade turns to face --

	FROST, 

	who's advancing, clutching Blade's own sword in his hand. He thrusts
	the sword forward --

	Blade presses the grip-trigger on his punching dagger -CHING!- the
	two side blades spread out. We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on
	metal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the
	dagger blades --

	For a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together,
	then, Frost forces Blade backwards --

	What happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever
	exposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge
	and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.

	Frost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge
	biting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword
	for another strike --

	-- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm
	off at the shoulder --

	The severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To
	Frost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding
	red, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm-
	stump to re-attach itself!

	Undaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section,
	meeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his
	dagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again.

	Blade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding
	what has happened.

				FROST
		You're too late, Blade. I'm already 
		changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper 
		has awakened. I'm not just Frost 
		anymore. I'm becoming a god now, 
		blood incarnate.

	Even as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph,
	bleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't
	walk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of
	animated blood! A blood demon.

	ON KAREN,

	as she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's
	discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the
	periphery of her vision --

	VANESSA

	rushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in
	an eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning
	her. 

				VANESSA
		Did you think I'd forgotten you, you 
		little whore?

	BACK TO FROST,

	who towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid-
	like form.

				FROST
		You can't hurt me anymore. 

	WHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING
	WITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly --

	-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the
	blink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying
	behind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger --

	Once again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a
	series of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back
	again in a series of split-second transformations.

	Blade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time --

	WHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million
	zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to
	pin-point his foe's next manifestation.

				BLADE
		Where are you?!

	Frost's voice answers from all directions.

				FROST
		Everywhere.

	A DROPLET OF BLOOD

	spatters the floor at Blade's feet. Blade looks up --

	A SHOWER OF BLOOD

	rains from above, coalescing into Frost as he sweeps down on Blade
	like a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor. 

				FROST
		You want my blood so much?! Take it!

	Frost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts
	of blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist
	around Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's
	head in a bubble of blood.

	Blade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he
	could dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!

	BACK TO VANESSA

	as she wraps a hand around Karen's throat, choking her.

	As Karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip
	pocket, digging something out -- Whistler's vampire mace canister!

	She forces it up between them, triggering a jet of TOXIC MIST into
	Vanessa's face --

	Vanessa recoils, HOWLING, her head smoking as if it were doused with
	formic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. Karen lunges for
	Blade's sword --

	BACK TO FROST AND BLADE

	Blade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles
	stream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask
	of insanity.

				FROST
		I was wrong about you, Blade. You were 
		never one of us. You're a traitor to 
		your race. 

				KAREN (O.S.)
		Get away from him!

	Frost looks up -- Karen is wielding Blade's sword. She brings it down
	on Frost, severing the blood-tendrils which envelope Blade. The
	blood-bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from Blade's face. He
	gasps, chokes in air --

	Frost backs away, horrified. His blood-tendrils don't reform.
	Instead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline
	powder.

				KAREN
		Blade!

	Karen flings the sword at Blade. 

	THE SWORD 

	spins end over end, its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating
	pinwheels of candlelight as Blade catches the weapon by its hilt.

	Blade rises, advancing on Frost, sword outstretched and Frost
	retreats, uncertain now.

				BLADE
		Guess you're not quite as invulnerable 
		as you thought.

				FROST
		You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and 
		my transition will be complete. Even 
		your sword won't be able to affect me 
		then.

				BLADE
		You don't have a few minutes, Frost.

	Frost eyes Blade warily, then lunges towards Vanessa, sweeping behind
	her. Blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, Frost
	spins Vanessa around, using her body as a shield!

	Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his
	mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's
	poisonous mace. Piteous, really. 

	Frost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of Blade's to exploit.

				FROST
			(laughing cruelly)
		Just as I thought. Still chained to 
		your mother's breast after all these 
		years.

	In the same instant, Vanessa's features morph, taking on the angelic,
	youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo.

				FROST
			(gloating)
		You're too human, Blade. 

				BLADE
			(steeling himself)
		It's because I'm human that I can do 
		this.

	Frost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for --

	Blade is already LUNGING forward, driving the sword-point through
	Vanessa's chest, on into Frost's heart! It strikes the stone behind
	them, SHATTERING and --

	Frost and Vanessa HOWL AS ONE, their SCREAMS rising to an unendurable
	intensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding
	ball of light and ATOMIZING BLOOD.

	Blade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the
	backlash of occult energy as a near tidal WAVE of blood surges over
	him -- 

	EXT. BANK OF EREBUS - CITY STREET - NIGHT

	Every door and window of the bank is BLOWN OUTWARD from the force of
	the EXPLOSION. While along the street, manhole covers flip from their
	moorings, spinning up into the air like dimes, being buoyed by
	geysers of blood.

	INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT

	Silence, just the steady DRIP-DRIP of liquid draining. The underworld
	temple gleams with a crimson sheen now. 

	ON BLADE 

	as he stirs. He's been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force
	of the blast, soaked to the quick by blood. He rises to his feet,
	retrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon. At his feet -- 

	THE SWORDBLADE 

	lies in pieces. Amidst them, we find the singed remains of the locket
	-- Vanessa's face barely recognizable beneath the grime. Blade stoops
	to pick it up.

				KAREN (O.S.)
		Blade?

	Blade turns. Karen moves to him, searching his eyes. Which side of
	Blade's soul has won out? Human or vampire?

	Then she SEES the tears rimming Blade's eyes, the first he's shed in
	a lifetime. Human. 

	They embrace, holding each other that way for a long, long time. And
	we --

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK OF EREBUS - DAWN

	Blade and Karen stand on the rooftop, watching as dawn slowly creeps
	across the silent city.

				KAREN
		I never imagined I'd be so happy to 
		see the sun rise --
			(turning to him)
		It's over, isn't it?

				BLADE
		For them. But for me --

	He lifts his face towards the rising sun, letting its warmth wash
	over his upturned face.

				BLADE
		I feel like it's finally beginning.

	And on that note we leave them -- TWO FIGURES, silhouetted against
	the new day.

	FADE TO BLACK.

	THE END

                                ****************

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION LOCKER ROOM - DAY               1

        THE EYE                                                 2

        It's magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of green
        and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments
        surround the undulating center.

        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuations of the iris.

        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
        looks like an over-stuffed kid.  "LEON" it says on
        his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's
        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
        his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed
        in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans
        whir above their heads.

                                LEON
                  Okay if I talk?

        Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                LEON
                  I kinda get nervous when I
                  take tests.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't move.

                                LEON
                  Sorry.

        He tries not to move but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                LEON
                  Already had I.Q. test this year --
                  but I don't think I never had a...

                                HOLDEN
                         (cutting in)
                  Reaction time is a factor in this,
                  so please pay attention.  Answer
                  quickly as you can.

        Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.
        Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke
        response.

                                HOLDEN
                  You're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you look down and see a...

                                LEON
                  What one?

        It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                HOLDEN
                  What?

                                LEON
                  What desert?

                                HOLDEN
                  Doesn't make any difference what
                  desert -- it's completely
                  hypothetical.

                                LEON
                  But how come I'd be there?

                                HOLDEN
                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you
                  want to be by yourself -- who
                  knows.  So you look down and
                  see a tortoise.  It's crawling
                  towards you...

                                LEON
                  A tortoise.  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  Know what a turtle is?

                                LEON
                  Of course.

                                HOLDEN
                  Same thing.

                                LEON
                  I never seen a turtle.

        He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                LEON
                  But I understand what you mean.

                                HOLDEN
                  You reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, Leon.

        Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
        in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                LEON
                  You make these questions, Mr.
                  Holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not
                  without your help.  But you're
                  not helping.

        Leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                LEON
                  Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

                                HOLDEN
                  I mean you're not helping!
                  Why is that, Leon?

        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside
        of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS
        a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach.
        Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes
        through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean
        as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the
        bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the
        floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he
        stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,
        FIRES at the machine on the table.

        There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff
        is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as
        Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins
        to blink, faint but steady.

        EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                     3

        The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe
        the end, of the beginning of a day.

        The train that follows, cuts through the night at 400
        miles an hour.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      4

        No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long,
        insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed
        lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for
        the passenger half way down.

        His eyes closed, head rested against the glass.  Ten
        years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a
        track man or a welter-weight.  The body looks it, but
        the face has seen some time -- not all of it good.

        INT. TRAIN - REFRESHMENT DISPENSER - NIGHT              5

        Deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the
        mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      6

        Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and
        drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
        sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up
        staring at his reflection in the window.  Runs a
        hand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leans
        closer and peers through the glass.

        Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SAN
        ANGELES, THREE MINUTES.

        EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                   7

        The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with-
        out a sound.  Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard
        disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the
        sweltering night.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   8

        Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his
        shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow
        passage under orbs of yellow light.

        EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT                                   9

        Deckard unlocks his car and gets in.  Turns the ig-
        nition and hits a sensor.  The dash console glows
        and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
        things off.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  It was 97 degrees in the city and
                  no hope of improvement.  Not bad
                  if you're a lizard.  But two hours
                  earlier I was drinking Acquavit
                  with an Eskimo lady in North East
                  Alaska.  That's a tough change to
                  make.  It was so good, I didn't
                  want to leave, so I left a day
                  early.

        A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the
        panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
        sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and
        caller.  The last one is repeated five times.  Deckard
        sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.

                                DECKARD
                  Contact.  This is Blade Runner One
                  calling Com-fast 27.

        The SOUND OF A CHIME precedes the mechanical female
        voice that answers.

                                VOICE
                  Blade Runner One, stand by please.

        A pause.  Followed by a husky male voice.

                                VOICE
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  Yah, Gaff.

                                GAFF (VOICE)
                  Where the hell you been?

                                DECKARD
                  You know where I been.  I been on
                  vacation.

                                GAFF
                  Next time you go on vacation,
                  do me a favor, let us know where
                  it is.

                                DECKARD
                  What's up?

                                GAFF
                  Holden got hit.

        There is a pause.  That was bad news.

                                DECKARD
                  Bad?

                                GAFF
                  Severed spine.  You'd better get
                  in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll see you in a minute.

        The ENGINE REVS, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
        the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot.

        INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT                        10

        An enormous grey vault of a building.  A businesslike
        Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief-
        case and police ID pinned to his coat.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6,
                  The Tyrell Corporation's new pride
                  and joy.  Holden was administering
                  the Voight-Kampff test when one
                  nailed him.

        The door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks
        through.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The Nexus-6 must be fast because
                  Holden was as quick as they come.
                  The report said there were six of
                  them.  Three males and three female.
                  Led by a combat model called Roy
                  Batty.

        INT. INSPECTOR BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT                  11

        The INSPECTOR is in his fifties.  The deep creases in
        his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say
        brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the
        wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe
        trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of
        the desk reading the print-out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  They escaped from the colonies
                  two weeks ago.  Killed twenty-
                  three people and jumped a shuttle.
                  An aerial patrol found the ship
                  in the desert.  No crew.

        Bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
        whiskey.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Bryant's got a liver problem.  A
                  couple years back he handed me a
                  bottle and said have a drink for
                  another man.  I been drinking
                  for him ever since.

        Deckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant
        just poured for him.

                                DECKARD
                  Six, huh?

                                BRYANT
                  Five.  Three nights ago one of
                  them managed to break into the
                  Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two
                  guards and got as far as the
                  Genetic Sector before he got
                  fried going through an electro-
                  field.

                                DECKARD
                  What was he after?

                                BRYANT
                  There wasn't much left of him,
                  so we can't be sure.  But bio-
                  chemical data and morphology records
                  of the Nexus-6 were reported
                  missing.  Going on the possibility
                  they might try to infiltrate we
                  send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
                  tests on the new employees.  Guess
                  he found himself one.

        A grim pause.

                                DECKARD
                  You got a machine on it yet?

                                BRYANT
                  We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that
                  picked up Holden's alarm.  Its
                  guess is that all five are in
                  the city.

                                DECKARD
                  Where do we start?

        Bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.

                                BRYANT
                  The Tyrell Corporation has a
                  demo model.  Check it out on the
                  Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance
                  the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
                  to detect.  If that's the case,
                  everybody's up shit creek.

                                DECKARD
                  What was the cover on the one that
                  got Holden?

                                BRYANT
                  Industrial refuse.

                                DECKARD
                  Garbage man?

        Bryant nods.

                                DECKARD
                  Did personnel have an address on
                  him?

        Bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket,
        copies down a number and hands it over.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll go take a look.

        Deckard stands and holds up his drink.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant
        watches Deckard down the whiskey.  Deckard puts down
        the glass and turns to leave.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The big incentive to emigrate was
                  still free labor.  If the public
                  found out that their door-prizes
                  might kill them, they might not be
                  so hot to go up there.  This was
                  one of the worst one's we had and
                  Bryant was worried.  He wanted to
                  tell me to be discrete or something.
                  But I didn't give him a chance.

        EXT. LEON'S HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT                      12

        An electrical storm is brewing.  Deckard stands out-
        side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,
        as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden
        downpour.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                         13

        A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
        balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;
        Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other
        lower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,
        cramped and darkly alive.

        Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
        crowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating
        as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of
        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.

        A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as
        he turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door
        that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened
        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
        his hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words
        which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.
        The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and
        shuts the door.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                      14

        The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no
        more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
        outs of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the door
        he's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then
        knocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
        opens it.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                15

        An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in
        and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a
        place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
        clean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless
        basin is perfectly folded.

        Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He
        looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.
        The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks
        under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the
        mattress.

        The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.
        Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes
        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
        fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-
        lessness, he lifts off the lid.

        It contains a little stack of photos bound with a
        rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp
        by the balcony window and turns it on.

        A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of
        anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.
        The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the
        sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded
        polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of
        simple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious
        collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies
        them with interest.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               16

        Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands
        in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers
        looking like he'd never been touched by the light of
        day.

        Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,
        watching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearing
        his coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is
        more intent, smarter and angry.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               17

        For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash
        something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears
        into the crowd.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                18

        Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the
        window.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      19

        Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to
        match, but he's a graceful runner.  Looks like he could
        do it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alley
        behind him and he's not out of breath.

        EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT                                  20

        Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto
        a narrow street.  The Asian Quarter.

        INT. CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT                            21

        A seamy as well as steamy little place.  Counter and
        small tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over their
        fuming bowls jabbering and slurping.

        The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-
        D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV
        announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty
        in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes
        a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Choose from a variety of seventy
                  nine different personality types.
                  Each and every one a loyal trouble-
                  free companion given to you upon
                  your arrival absolutely free...

        The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray
        Bolger type gentleman's gentleman who clicks his heels,
        snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the
        next.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  To use as personal body servant
                  to tireless field hand -- the
                  custom tailored humanoid robot,
                  designed especially for your
                  needs.

        The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and
        the woman seated at the table by the window are.

        The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind
        and blue-eyed.  MARY looks like an American dream mom,
        right out of "Father Knows Best."

        The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor,
        short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant,
        but the eyes are grey and chilling.  ROY BATTY is a
        presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what
        goes on around him.

        Leon has just come through the door behind them.  Try-
        ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches
        their table and kneels .  Batty doesn't bother to look
        at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his
        quiet voice.

                                BATTY
                  Did you get your precious 'things'?

                                LEON
                  Somebody was already there.

                                BATTY
                  Police.

                                LEON
                  Just a man.

                                BATTY
                  Police man.

        Leon looks sullen.

                                BATTY
                  Why don't you have a seat.

        There's one next to him.  Leon pulls it over and sits.

                                BATTY
                  Enjoy the view.

        From the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit
        so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem
        almost invisible.  The view they're "enjoying" is
        through the window.  Outside the neon side in the win-
        dow directly across the street says:  HANNIBAL CHEW,
        MEMBERS.

        INT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT                       22

        Chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled
        eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him
        looks like a Charles Dickens invention.

        He's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched
        over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand.  After
        a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent
        smile.

                                CHEW
                  Well, you're right.  This little
                  honey has a couple of defective cones.

        He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his
        client.

        SEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has
        gone too far, too fast.  Premature old age has made
        his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The
        house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  Se-
        bastian is a closet genius.

                                CHEW
                  You're a regular perfectionist,
                  Sebastian.

        Sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic
        Mr. Chew.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  It's gotta be right for my
                  customer.

                                CHEW
                  Your customer, eh?

        Chew snickers and beckons.  Sebastian follows his down
        a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  There's
        a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  Chew
        tugs it on and they go through.  The big door slams
        shut behind them.

        INT. COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                          23

        Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in-
        struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a
        morgue.  The glass-doored compartments in the walls
        look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office
        boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed
        box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into
        the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
        an eye.

        Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered
        to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and
        studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through
        his pockets.

                                CHEW
                  You got a pocket-charger, boy?

        Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like
        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket
        and steps closer.  The back of the eye is touched with
        the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring
        back at them.

                                CHEW
                  Is that good enough for your
                  customer?

        Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods.  Chew reseals the
        eye taking his time.  He can afford to, he's wearing
        his coat.

                                CHEW
                  How much is he paying you?

        In place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat,
        stares at the bag like he didn't hear.

                                CHEW
                  Well, when do you get paid?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Soon as I finish the job.

                                CHEW
                  When might that be?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Day after tomorrow.

                                CHEW
                  Oh!  Day after tomorrow.

        Sebastian nods.  Chew stares at the poor bastard, con-
        cerned in spite of himself.

                                CHEW
                  The rich hate to pay, Sebastian.
                  A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting.
                  Pay the little guy last.  You should
                  charge twice as much.  It'll make
                  him feel better.

        Sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll
        do.  Chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thanks, Mr. Chew.

        Chew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes
        through quick as a dog.

        EXT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S STORE - STREET - NIGHT             24

        Sebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he
        came for and there's a hopeful spring to his walk as
        he heads for his truck.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S AMBULANCE - NIGHT                      25

        It's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights.
        The lettering on the side reads "J.R. SEBASTIAN -
        ANIMOID EXPRESS."  Sebastian gets in, starts up the
        engine and suddenly realizes he's not alone.  It's a
        jolt that causes him to yelp.

        PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up
        with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for
        a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-
        ing.

        But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.
        Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her
        and opens the door.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hey!  You forgot your...

        He holds up the bag.  Hesitantly she reaches for it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How come you were in my truck?

                                PRIS
                  I was tired and didn't have any
                  place to go.

        She stares at him, hand on her case, looking lost.
        Sebastian isn't good at this, but he tries.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You can get back in if you want...

        She can't make up her mind.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

        She gets in.  Both of them are silent.  People are not
        Sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this
        girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age --
        it gives him courage.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What's your name?

                                PRIS
                  Pris.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

                                PRIS
                  Hi.

        So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
        while what comes next.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!  Where do you want to go?

        She shrugs.  That leaves him a lot of responsibility.
        He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You want to go home?

                                PRIS
                  I don't have one.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh.

        What do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like
        she's lost out of some "Welcome to Sunny Arizona"
        poster?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Where are your folks?

                                PRIS
                  They left.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What about friends?

                                PRIS
                  I have some, but I have to find
                  out where they are staying.

        She leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash.
        Her body would win prizes, from any angle.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, where should I take you?

        She looks at him,a shadow of enticement in her clear
        blue eyes.

                                PRIS
                  We scared each other pretty good
                  didn't we?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  We sure did.

        She giggles and laughs.

                                PRIS
                  I'm hungry, J.F.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I've got stuff.  If you wanna go
                  to my place?

                                PRIS
                  I was hoping you'd say that.

        Sebastian's face is normally on the grey side, but it
        just turned red.  He turns on the ignition and they
        pull away from the curb.

        INT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    26

        Speeding along the freeway.  The terminal in the com-
        munications console lit.  Deckard's right hand just
        finished a punch-up.  The screen flashes back.

        REQUEST

        Deckard punches up.  Letters flash across the screen:

        ESPER

        Screen flashes back:

        CLEARANCE

        Deckard punches up.

        BLADE RUNNER ONE CODE ML-33

        Pause.

        Screen flashes:

        STAND BY.

        Deckard's voice has been heard over the preceding.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Machines can be helpful sometimes,
                  but they can also be a pain in the
                  ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger
                  and you might wind up at a steel-
                  mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once
                  in a while -- it's their personalities
                  that usually get me.  Somebody once
                  said that man makes machines in his own
                  image.  If that's true, whoever made
                  Esper should have been shot.

                                ESPER
                  This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go
                  ahead please.

        Esper's deep melodious voice is anxious to please, and
        oiled with a touch of self-pity.

                                DECKARD
                  You equipped for random questions?

                                ESPER
                  Why, yes, of course.

                                DECKARD
                  You start.

                                ESPER
                  The five in question are third
                  generation Nexus Sixes, constructed
                  of skin-flesh culture, selected
                  enogenic transfer conversion

                  and developed for emigration
                  program.  Are you with me?

                                DECKARD
                  How do I stop one?

                                ESPER
                  Unlike a five, they can sustain
                  massive traumas to several parts
                  of the body without debilitating
                  another.  Sever a leg and it will
                  perform quicker on the remaining leg
                  than the fastest man can run,

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, but...

                                ESPER
                  I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable
                  zone is the base of the skull,
                  the occipital bone.  A direct hit
                  is a positive retirement.

        The communication is interrupted by a BELL which is
        immediately followed by a stern, MECHANICAL VOICE.

                                VOICE
                  You are in violation of traffic

        In his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad
        motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds
        of hell.  They draw silently alongside.  Deckard
        presses his I.D. to the window.

        The cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his
        partner accelerate, vanish in the night.  And Deckard's
        car does too.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT                              27

        A district of silence and ruin.  The street is strewn
        with refuse.  The building looks vacant.  A ten storey
        condo gone to shit.  The vandals have come and gone
        long ago.

        Sebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb.
        MR. DEETCHUM, the old Watchman, sitting in the building
        entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic
        book.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      28

        Well stocked with items of survival, all labeled and
        stacked.  And shelved along the walls and hung from the
        ceiling is a menagerie of animoids.  Like so many broken
        toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastian's wise hands.
        
        Sebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a
        stereo scope.  The tool in his right hand is a sensor
        probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en-
        graver.

        The object of his concentration is a maze-like chip
        configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified
        under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a
        large city.  The needle-like sensor probe moves care-
        fully over the contours of the configuration, testing
        the bonds.

        Suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!

        Pris is light on her feet.  She's standing behind him
        with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand.

                                PRIS
                  Whatcha doin'?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You scared me.

        But he's happy to see her.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'm working.

        She's changed her dress and made up her face.  Looks a
        little older and sexier.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You look... better.

                                PRIS
                  Just better.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Beautiful.

                                PRIS
                  Thanks.

        He watches her as she prowls around the room, looking
        at this and that, eating her sandwich.

                                PRIS
                  And you live in this building all
                  by yourself?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yeah, I live here pretty much
                  alone right now...

        Trying to make light of it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No housing shortage around here...
                  plenty of room for everybody.

        She sprawls on the couch studying him.

                                PRIS
                  How old are you?

        He can't meet her eyes.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Twenty.

                                PRIS
                  What's your problem?

        It's not an easy subject.  His voice is barely audible.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Methuselah Syndrome.

                                PRIS
                  What's that?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  My glands.  They grow old too fast.

                                PRIS
                  Is that why you're still here?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

        There is a silence.  He steals a glance at her.

                                PRIS
                  I like you just the way you are.

        Under the desk he bats his knees together.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Ah, you get hold of your friends?

                                PRIS
                  As a matter of fact I did.  They've
                  got some work to do tonight, but
                  they're gonna come tomorrow.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Good.

        The implications catch up.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I can sleep on the couch.

        A little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs
        up.

                                MOUSE
                  Don't let the bed bugs bite!

        Taking their cue from the mouse, some of the more
        talented animoids toot, flap and wheel about.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        29

        It's dark except for the glow of the terminal.  A tired
        Deckard sits in front of it.  Esper sounds like he's
        been talking for hours.

        A long pause.

                                ESPER
                  Here's something you might find
                  interesting.  They have been built
                  to emulate the human in every way
                  except in its emotional spectrum.
                  However, after a period of time
                  it is only logical that such a
                  'mechanism' would create its own
                  emotional responses, hate, love,
                  fear, anger, envy.

                                DECKARD
                  I know all that.

                                ESPER
                  What about a summary then.

                                DECKARD
                  I think we're through for the night.

        Deckard starts to reach for the panel.

                                ESPER
                  Mr. Deckard.

        Hesitates.

                                DECKARD
                  Yes?

                                ESPER
                  Do you have something against
                  science?

                                DECKARD
                  Not if it works.

                                ESPER
                  And what in your estimation works?

                                DECKARD
                  The umbrella.

        Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the
        terminal off button before Esper can respond and the
        machine goes dead.  He sits there for a moment then
        flips on the lamp.  Leon's snap-shots are spread out
        before him.

        INT. SPINNER - DAY                                      30

        A police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into
        a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Every government that could was
                  racing to populate their colonial
                  territory.  But emigrants needed
                  incentive.  Over-population and
                  the greenhouse factor didn't seem
                  to be enough; but owning a human
                  look-a-like had lots of appeal.
                  It was big industry, the competition
                  was stiff and Tyrell was top of the
                  line.

        EXT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           31

        The spinner gently touches down.  The hatch drops open
        and Deckard steps out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  His claim to fame was making a
                  product more human than human and
                  sometimes the 'more' turned out to
                  be a problem.  This wasn't just an
                  escaped andy who broke his owner's
                  arm -- there were twenty-eight
                  people dead and the pressure was
                  on.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           32

        Deckard walks up to a desk, hands his I.D. to a guard
        who checks it against a list on a screen.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But so far they'd always managed
                  to keep it quiet.  Not to say
                  that once in a while there wasn't
                  bad publicity.  Some fanatic
                  bitching about equal rights for
                  andies or an occasional trade union
                  proclaiming it was aun-American for
                  automatons to take jobs away from
                  humans on the colony.

        The guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button
        and Deckard walks away.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But what's more American than good
                  old supply and demand?  The
                  Government needed them, industry
                  made them and the church backed
                  them.  The big religious boys
                  said that Androids, no matter how
                  human, were objects; only God
                  could make people. I'm not religious,
                  but I was inclined to agree.
                  Otherwise I'd be out of a job.

        The elevator door slides open.  The young lady inside
        would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in
        the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting.

                                RACHAEL
                  Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is
                  Rachael.

        Deckard tips his head to her and steps in.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY                  33

        No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes
        closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi-
        ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty
        is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead.

        The door slides open and they continue down the corri-

                                 RACHAEL
                  It seems your department doesn't
                  believe out new unit is to the
                  public benefit.

                                 DECKARD
                  A humanoid robot is like any other
                  machine, it can be a benefit or a
                  hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's
                  not our problem.

                                 RACHAEL
                  But because your department can't
                  do an adequate job in detecting
                  the miniscule number at large,
                  it's a problem.  Correct, Mr.
                  Deckard?

        Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking
        at the animals.  Small northern animals in neat "en-
        vironmental" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon
        and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops
        him.  The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
        off them.

                                RACHAEL
                  You like our owl?

        Deckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens
        its yellow eyes and blinks at them.

                                DECKARD
                  It's artificial?

                                RACHAEL
                  Of course not.

        Hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards
        the exit without looking back.

        The exit is another tube.  Just big enough for two.  No
        room for excess.  He tries to ignore her cool appraising
        stare.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're in a very unique position,
                  Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the
                  future of this entire organization
                  according to how you work your
                  little test.

        Deckard has nothing to say.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you apprehensive?

                                DECKARD
                  Why should I be?

                                RACHAEL
                  For the responsibility of your
                  power.  Being a police bureaucrat,
                  you've got more than your share.

        The door slides open.  Deckard looks down at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You got it wrong, girl.  I work
                  with the bureau not for them.

        He lets it sink in.

                                DECKARD
                  My job isn't to detect
                  malfunctioning andies, it's to
                  eliminate them.  The more the
                  better.

        He walks out of the elevator first.

        INT. INNER SANCTUM OF DR. TYRELL - DAY                  34

        The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience
        reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like
        glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  Dr. Tyrell is a
        fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained
        from steroids and surgery.  Dapper and trim, he leans
        against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket
        watch.  The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE
        BREWING in the background.

        Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of
        Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule
        and face another door, this one befitting the decor of
        the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
        they enter.

                                RACHAEL
                  Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please
                  sit down.  Would you care for a cup
                  of coffee?

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

                                TYRELL
                  Black?

                                DECKARD
                  Please.

        Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
        cups and hands one to Deckard.  The congenial light in
        his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth.

                                TYRELL
                  Somehow, I didn't expect that the
                  man who did the dirty work would
                  be the man to do the technical
                  work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard.

        He hands Deckard a cup of coffee.

                                TYRELL
                  Is this to be an empathy test?

                                DECKARD
                  Yes.

                                TYRELL
                  Capillary dilation of the so-called
                  blush response?  Plus fluctuation
                  of the pupil, plus involuntary
                  dilation of the iris?

        Deckard nods.

                                TYRELL
                  May I ask a personal question?

                                DECKARD
                  Go ahead.

                                TYRELL
                  Have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake?

                                DECKARD
                  No.

                                TYRELL
                  But in your profession that is a
                  risk.

                                DECKARD
                  Nothing is infallible, but so far
                  the Voight-Kampff scale bas been
                  foolproof.

                                TYRELL
                  Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a
                  machine can be a hazard.  The
                  Voight-Kampff scale is a machine,
                  isn't it?

                                DECKARD
                  One that relies on human
                  interpretation.  Where's the
                  subject?

                                TYRELL
                  Sitting next to you.

        Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell.  Delighted,
        Tyrell takes a cup of coffee.

        Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and
        starts fishing out the apparatus.

        THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF                                       35

        Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot
        with light, the pupil contracting.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Ready.

                                RACHAEL
                  Go ahead.

        In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both
        gauges are at rest.  Dr. Tyrell stands silhouetted behind
        Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam
        trained on her eye.  Wire mesh discs are attached to her
        cheeks.

                                DECKARD
                  You're given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday.

        The needles in both gauges swing violently past green to
        red, then subside.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd
                  report the person who gave it to
                  me to the police.

                                DECKARD
                  You have a little boy.  He shows
                  you his butterfly collection, plus
                  the killing jar.

        Again the gauges register, but not so far.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd take him to the doctor.

                                DECKARD
                  You're watching T.V. and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on your
                  wrist.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd kill it.

        Both needles go to red.  Deckard makes a note, takes a
        sip of coffee and continues.

                                DECKARD
                  In a magazine you come across a
                  full-page photo of a nude girl.

                                RACHAEL
                  Is this testing whether I'm an
                  android or a lesbian?

                                DECKARD
                  You show the picture to your husband.
                  He likes it and hangs it on the wall.
                  The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

                                RACHEL
                  I wouldn't let him.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  I should be enough for him.

        Deckard frowns, then smiles.  His smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around.

                                DECKARD
                  You become pregnant by a man who
                  runs off with your best friend,
                  and you decide to get an abortion.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd never get an abortion.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  In your opinion.

                                RACHAEL
                  It would be my child.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like you speaks from
                  experience.

        He notes the needles.  One goes green and the other
        remains inert.

                                DECKARD
                  Last question.  You're watching
                  an old movie.  It shows a banquet in
                  progress, the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters.

                                RACHAEL
                  Ugh.

        Both needles swing swiftly.

                                DECKARD
                  The entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice.

        Needles move less.

                                DECKARD
                  The raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog.

        Deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
        switches off his beam.

                                DECKARD
                  Lights please.

        The lights come on.

                                TYRELL
                  Well?

                                DECKARD
                  If she is, the machine works.

                                TYRELL
                  The machine works.  She is.

        Rachael sits very still.  Except her eyes -- they go to
        Tyrell and hang on.  He stares back at her as he speaks.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions did it take?

                                DECKARD
                  Thirteen.

        Rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles
        around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell.
        His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  She's hang-
        ing by a thread.

        Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.

                                DECKARD
                  She didn't know?

                                TYRELL
                  Memory implant.  She was programmed.
                  But I think she has transcended
                  her conditioning.  I think she was
                  beginning to suspect.

        Rachael nods fixedly.  Careful not to let go her grasp.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions does it usually
                  take, Mr. Deckard?

                                DECKARD
                  Five, maybe six.

        Slowly, carefully, Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael
        and turns towards Deckard, who is starting to put away
        his equipment.

                                TYRELL
                  You're going to have to be on your
                  toes, my friend.

        Deckard glances back at him.

                                TYRELL
                  It's a complex problem and we
                  wouldn't want anything to happen
                  to you.

        Less of a man might shrink at the end of Deckard's look,
        but not Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  For the good of all, I recommend
                  you take Rachael with you.
                  Considering her uniqueness, I'm
                  sure she could prove quite helpful.

        Deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of Tyrell's
        style.  He turns away and starts packing up the Voight-
        Kampff.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

        Deckard is ready to go.

                                TYRELL
                  And how is it one man will be able
                  to cover so much ground?

                                DECKARD
                  Discreetly.

                                TYRELL
                  All pertinent information is
                  being fed into your departmental
                  computer, an Esper 231 -- I
                  believe -- and a photo over-lay
                  packet is being produced.

        Deckard opens the door.

                                TYRELL
                  Mr. Deckard, I think it would be
                  wise to reconsider my offer.

        Rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her
        feet flat on the floor, alone is the word.

        Trying to keep the fury out of it, Deckard's voice
        comes out in a whisper.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        On the last word, Rachael glances up at him and Deckard
        turns away. The outer door slides open and he goes
        through it.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     36

        As seen through the windshield from the passenger side
        of a vintage Dusenberg.  The headlights cut through the
        dark, illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road.  A
        downgrade.

        A sign slides by stating:  "Caution Curves Ahead."
        Good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop
        to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left.

        The steady HUM of the ENGINE and the HISS of the TIRES
        will remain, but the location suddenly changes to:

        INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                       37

        A pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm.  The
        young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug.
        Her back to the viewer.  As she bends over to vacuum
        beneath the couch, exposing her beautiful ass, an
        admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired MALE
        VOICE intercedes.

                                VOICE
                  Let's keep our eyes on the road,
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Sorry.

        Abruptly the VIEW FLASHES BACK TO:

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     38

        The moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing
        over the hood of the car.  The road is getting steeper
        and the corners sharper.  Rags of mist skim by as the
        Dusenberg picks up speed.  It is becoming a riveting
        ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        39

        Swift, soft clouds overhead.  In the cold shine of
        the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples
        and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the
        frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue-white snow,
        melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich
        brown earth.

                                VOICE
                  Come on, stay with the machine.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     40

        The Dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating
        up the road.  Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four-
        wheel drifts.  Not a pleasant sensation if you don't
        like roller-coasters.

        The Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
        hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend.

        Good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into
        high and screws on.

        EXT. LAKE - DAY                                         41

        Cold and gray.  The current running strong.  The nose
        of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling
        for the shore.

        This is cold remote country, wild and untouched.  A sky
        bluer than the Madonna's cloak.  The kayak banks and
        the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach
        towards a little camp.

                                VOICE
                  We're going to have to start the
                  sequence again if you don't stay
                  with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  How do you know I'm not?

                                VOICE
                  You're not responding to the
                  stimulus.  I can see right here,
                  I'm not getting a reading.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  I'm tired of this.

                                VOICE
                  Almost through.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     42

        In the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen-
        ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by
        the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled.  And the
        passenger's view snaps back to the road.

        Suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach-
        ing bend.  Large ones, of a bus or a truck.  Blinding.

        The Dusenberg is going too fast to stop.  No room to
        pass.  HORNS BLAST.  The Dusenberg brakes, goes into a
        broadside skid.  The hands of the passenger reach out
        and grip the mahogany dash.  Brakes locked, TIRES
        SCREAMING, skidding.  The Dusenberg tears through the
        railing and plunges into space.  The last view of the
        passenger is pure vertigo.  Silence.

        INT. DOCTOR WHEELER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                43

        The good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which
        resembles a pin-ball machine.  Displayed under its
        surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
        read-outs indicating the results of the test.

        Deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which
        it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no
        worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to
        the doctor's desk.

                                DECKARD
                  So how did I do?

        Dr. Wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise
        of compassion in his sunken eyes.

                                WHEELER
                  Nerves of steel.

                                DECKARD
                  No rust?

                                WHEELER
                  I didn't say that.  Your motivity
                  rate checked out a little slower
                  than last time.

                                DECKARD
                  Meaning?

                                WHEELER
                  Meaning you don't run as fast as
                  you used to.

        Deckard starts to dress.

                                WHEELER
                  During the road test...

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah?

                                WHEELER
                  Your mind kept wandering.  That
                  bothered me.

                                DECKARD
                  Huh huh.

                                WHEELER
                  Considering the nature of your
                  work, that could be unhealthy.

                                DECKARD
                  True.

        Wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger
        comes down on the section illuminating Deckard's simple
        statistics.

                                WHEELER
                  You got a birthday coming up.

        Deckard bends over slipping on his shoes.  Wheeler looks
        up, concerned.

                                WHEELER
                  But you haven't put in for
                  emigration.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.

                                WHEELER
                  You're going to be over the limit.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, I could make you a long
                  list of complaints about this
                  fucken city but I still rather be
                  here than up there.

                                WHEELER
                  What if you change your mind?

                                DECKARD
                  They'll change the limit before
                  I change my mind.

                                WHEELER
                  You sure?

                                DECKARD
                  Never been more sure of anything
                  in my life.

        Deckard is ready to go.  Looking at Wheeler, a little
        touched with his concern.

                                DECKARD
                  Why didn't you go?

                                WHEELER
                  Too old.

                                DECKARD
                  But if you could?

        Wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head.

                                WHEELER
                  My job is here.

                                DECKARD
                  Me too.

        They shake hands and Deckard walks.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON             44

        The referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep
        up with the two Mexican light-weights pounding the shit
        out of each other.  If not for the fuzz and the silence,
        the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think
        you were ringside at the Garden.  It's a good fight but
        Pris isn't watching.

        She's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
        nails.  The room is so quiet you can almost hear the
        polish.  She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE
        form above STOPS HER

        It sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR, but so quiet,
        sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  She
        stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at
        Sebastian.

        On the other side of the room, in his own world,
        Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering
        gossamer strands with a laser.

        Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
        quietly behind her.  If the animoids nestled around
        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd
        be the only ones in the room who did.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-     45
        NOON

        Pris moving smoothly past the doors, some of them open
        and warped offering sights and shadow and decay.

        INT. FIRE STAIRS - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-  46
        NOON

        The gloom in here is like the light of the empty well.
        Her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the
        hollow silence.

        INT. THE FLOOR ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       47
        AFTERNOON

        She's running now, down the hall, stops at the apart-
        ment directly above Sebastian's and opens the door.

        INT. APARTMENT ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       48
        AFTERNOON

        Mary turns her head as Pris comes in.  She's sitting in
        a chair.  The only piece of furniture in the room.
        It's broken and tilts at a funny angle.  She nods and
        Pris nods back.

        Batty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly
        from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck.

                                BATTY
                  What's going on down there?

                                PRIS
                  He's not ready yet.

                                BATTY
                  When?

                                PRIS
                  Tomorrow, he says.

        Batty nods he can't wait.  Pris glances at Mary and
        gives a frigid little smile.  Pris backs out and closes
        the door behind her.  Batty blows air through his
        nostrils.  Like an animal.

        EXT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    49

        The sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk.
        Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckard's car
        as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off-
        ramp curve.

        EXT./INT. CAR - STREETS - NIGHT                         50

        Moving through the dark city streets.  Deckard turns a
        corner and guns it up a long, steep hill.

        EXT. STREET - DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               51

        At the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and
        disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise.

        INT. CORRIDOR DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               52

        He's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped
        plastic plate and stops in front of his door.  It's
        riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of
        his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock,
        the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door
        shut behind him.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        53

        He slips on the light and crosses the front room.
        Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved
        in or is just moving out.

        As he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND
        him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out
        in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got
        shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but
        direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then
        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
        floor.

                                RACHAEL
                  Was that your dinner?

        Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.  I called and found out
                  you were on your way home.  These
                  were already delivered to your
                  department but I thought you
                  should have copies as soon as
                  possible.

        She's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
        pack.  But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to
        recede.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's the Nexus information you
                  wanted.

        He takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks
        must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily.
        He doesn't even want to ask.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        He realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and
        sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring
        at each other.  The situation makes awkward silence.
        At least for him.  She's looking at him like she's
        got something to say but isn't saying it.

                                DECKARD
                  Is there anything else?

                                RACHAEL
                  I know you think it complicates
                  your work, but I'm here to help.

                                DECKARD
                  I've already got more help than
                  I need.

                                RACHAEL
                  I think you need more help than
                  you've got.

        He doesn't, but she's not backing off.

                                RACHAEL
                  There's two reasons a man rejects
                  help.  Either because he's so good
                  at what he does he doesn't think
                  he needs it, or he's so insecure
                  he can't admit it.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either
                  way, but the answer is still no.

                                RACHAEL
                  Two of us might be more effective
                  than one.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        She smiles.

                                RACHAEL
                  No you don't.

        She lets it sink in.

                                RACHAEL
                  You use your equipment, don't you?

                                DECKARD
                  So?

                                RACHAEL
                  So, I'm a piece of equipment.
                  Use me.

        It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long
        one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do
        something about such an offer but...

        Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to
        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put-
        ting it back on the plate.

                                DECKARD
                  That's okay, I'll get it...

        He bends down to help, but she's already done it.
        Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes
        diminishes the distance even more.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do I make you nervous?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.

        And she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the
        plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor,
        almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her.
        She says it plain and simple.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's strange to suddenly realize
                  that what you thought was your
                  life is actually someone else's
                  fabrication.

        Deckard nods.  He feels it, but doesn't know what to
        do about it.

                                DECKARD
                  I can imagine.

                                RACHAEL
                  Can you?  I couldn't.

        These are not some of Deckard's finer moments.  But she
        doesn't seem to notice.

                                RACHAEL
                  A part of me is glad.  I think I
                  feel more.  I don't like who I was
                  before.

        Deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is
        glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen.

        In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks
        around for a place to put the plate, but things have
        piled up on him in here.  He contemplates the refrig-
        erator.

                                DECKARD
                  So why do you think they were
                  after their records.

        He's a lot more comfortable talking shop.

                                RACHAEL
                  They probably want to find out
                  when they were made.

                                DECKARD
                  Right.

        He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out.
        She's writing something on a card.

                                RACHAEL
                  I guess the date of your birth is
                  important if you know you're not
                  made to last.

        No way he can keep his foot out of it.  She looks up and
        hands him the card.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's my number.  If you need me.

        She goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before
        going through.

                                RACHAEL
                  You better get better locks --
                  if you want to keep me out.

        She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says
        she's talking about all kinds of locks.  Deckard looks
        like he might ask her to stay, but...

                                RACHAEL
                  Good night.

        And she's gone.

                                DECKARD
                  Night.

        He looks down at the number.  It's the back side of a
        snapshot.   He turns it over.  The picture of a man
        and a woman.  The little girl between them looks like
        a six-year old Rachael.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        54

        He's sitting in front of his console studying pictures
        of Nexus Sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless
        and unadorned on his monitor.

        The over-lay machine is transforming each image with
        instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors,
        age, youth, hats, glasses, etc.  All in rapid succession,
        running the gambit from ominous to beautiful.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The possibilities were infinite.
                  They could change their appearances
                  but not their future.
                  Like she said, it was short.
                  Longevity is what they were after.
                  The garbage man even wanted a past.
                  Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but
                  I knew she was right.  The market
                  worked on turn-over.  Built-in
                  obsolescence was the name of the
                  game.  That meant her too.  It
                  was something I didn't want to
                  think about.

        On top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with
        a spoon stuck in it.  Deckard puts out his cigarette
        and reaches for them as the PHONE RINGS.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  Bryant here.  Regarding the
                  rundown you requested on job
                  applicants, Esper's concluded that
                  the only irregular category that
                  Tyrell's got is the entertainment
                  section.  You better get on it.

                                DECKARD
                  I was just about to have my dinner.

                                BRYANT
                  If you hurry you'll get back
                  before it gets cold.  I got a
                  spinner on your roof in five
                  minutes.  Good luck.

        Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans.  He didn't
        want them anyway.  He gets up and walks to the bedroom.
        Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds
        his ankle laser and straps it on.

        EXT. CITY - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - NIGHT                     55

        The spinner skirts through the canyons of the city.
        Deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the
        maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks
        swing by below.  The tops of larger buildings shimmer
        with advertisements and weather announcements.

        INT. SPINNER - OVER CITY - NIGHT                        56

        Deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen-
        ing to Esper.

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind.  Do they have that
                  knowledge?

                                ESPER

        Back to business.

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, gimme a run-down on the

        EXT./INT. SPINNER - LANDING AREA - NIGHT                57

        Deckard taking it down.  About to pull it in an already
        crowded lot, but the sign flashes "FULL."  Deckard
        doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any-
        way when a Chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and
        waves him off.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck.

        Pissed, Deckard veers away and buzzes low over and
        around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a
        lot of room around here.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      58

        Finally brings it down between two buildings hardly
        enough clearance, but he jockeys the machine into an
        alley, touches down and runs it slowly along the surface
        -- parking it by a sign that says "NO PARKING."

        EXT. STREET - TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                      59

        Not many people.  Wind blowing.  A nest of garish
        small-time clubs.

        Deckard emerges from one, goes into the next.  The
        pulsing neon over the entry says "TAFFEY'S BAR."

        INT. TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                               60

        Crowded in here.  BONGO MUSIC.  Deckard is at the bar
        sitting next to a big-bellied man in a black beard who's
        looking through a viewer.  On the small stage in the
        background AMAZING RAMA is eating razor blades, a part
        of her juggling routine.

        Deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a
        door at the rear.

        INT. TAFFEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                            61

        Taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "Chicken
        Hawk" collector of young girls.

        It must be so, there's one in the bed.  Thin, pale,
        about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her
        fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead,
        lying flat on her back in Taffey's crowded little
        room.

        Taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow
        shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like
        a seal.  But at the moment he's not present.

        There's a KNOCK at the DOOR, then the SOUND of a TOILET
        FLUSHING.  Taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart
        pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches
        the door like the guilty fucker he is.  He looks through
        the peeper.

        Deckard is out there holding up his I.D.

                                DECKARD
                  Taffey Lewis?

                                TAFFEY
                  Yes?

                                DECKARD
                  Can I come in?

        There is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not
        to think of a way to say no.  The door opens and Deckard
        enters.  Except for the drool coming out of the corner of
        her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, Venus doesn't
        move a muscle.

                                TAFFEY
                  Excuse my niece there... She's
                  studying for an exam.

        Deckard takes the  Identikit hard copies our of his
        pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them
        out on the table.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like  you to take a look at
                  these pictures.

                                TAFFEY
                  Of course.

        Taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures
        from about two inches away.

                                TAFFEY
                  You see I lost my contacts a
                  couple of days ago around here
                  somewhere and my sight is a
                  little... What am I supposed
                  to be looking for?

                                DECKARD
                  Do you recognize any of
                  them?

        He stops at Zhora.

                                TAFFEY
                  This one looks familiar, but
                  I don't know.  Naw.  There's
                  one came in today looks a
                  little like this one but...

                                DECKARD
                  What did she want?

                                TAFFEY
                  Who?

                                DECKARD
                  The girl that doesn't look
                  like that girl.

                                TAFFEY
                  Nothing.  She wanted to know
                  about suck night.

                                DECKARD
                  What night?

                                TAFFEY
                  I didn't know if I wanted to
                  handle her -- I already got
                  a snake act.  But my partner
                  goes down there to the Opera
                  House on suck night to book
                  the good ones.

                                DECKARD
                  What's suck night?

                                TAFFEY
                  That's what we call in the
                  trade, audition free-for-
                  alls and most of it sucks.
                  Bit I don't think that's
                  her.

                                DECKARD
                  You talking about the Opera
                  House on the Main?

        Taffey nods.  Deckard goes to the door and turns.

                                DECKARD
                  Book the good ones for where?

                                TAFFEY
                  Lots of places.  The tours,
                  the clubs, the Silicone shows,
                  private parties.

                                DECKARD
                  What shows?

                                TAFFEY
                  Silicone Valley.  Lots of
                  these science guys never
                  leave that place.  We book
                  two shows a month in there.
                  Those big time techs and bio-
                  guys might be real high zoners
                  up here, but when it comes
                  to the arts, they like it loud
                  and lewd.

        It's starting to get a little gooey.  Deckard tips his
        head good night and backs out of the door.

        INT. THE OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                        62

        Onstage four Mexican acrobats, in matching metallic
        jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of
        a human wheel.  From the P.A. system the Announcer's
        voice blares through the cavernous theatre.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Let's hear it for the Hermano
                  Brothers.

        Scattered APPLAUSE.  Hand in hand, the Hermano Brothers
        bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Next we're gonna see a little
                  charmer who keeps her dancing
                  partner in a basket!  She
                  comes to us all the way from
                  exotic Casablanca.  'Salome.'

        The old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version
        of "In a Persian Market" as SALOME dances onstage.
        She's a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer
        costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in
        the right places.  She kneels ceremoniously center
        stage and sets the basket down before her.  Carefully
        removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four-
        foot harlequin-patterned python.  Grinding her hips
        to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out
        like an offering.  Sounds of approval from the audience.
        The gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer,
        as she weaves sensuously around the floor.

        INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                  63

        To scattered APPLAUSE, HOOTS and WHISTLES, Salome
        flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul-
        ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the
        narrow corridor to her dressing room.  She's about
        to enter when:

                                DECKARD
                  Excuse me, Miss Salome.

        She turns.  Deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum-
        ble, sleazy persistence.  He comes closer with his
        shit-eating grin.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like to have a word with you
                  if I could.

        Salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels
        -- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion
        of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                SALOME
                  Yeah?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm with the American Federation
                  of Variety Artists...

        He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't worry, I'm not here to make
                  you join -- that's not my department.

        He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm an investigator for the
                  Confidential Committee on Moral
                  Abuses.

        She nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                DECKARD
                  There's been reports of management
                  sexually abusing the artists in
                  this place.

                                SALOME
                  I don't know nothing about it.

                                DECKARD
                  You haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in any
                  way?

        She's definitely puzzled.

                                SALOME
                  How do you mean 'exploited'?

                                DECKARD
                  Like to get this position.  Did
                  you or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                SALOME
                  Are you for real?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh, yeah.
                  You'd be surprised what goes on
                  around here.  I'd like to check
                  the dressing room if I could.

                                SALOME
                  What the fuck for?

                                DECKARD
                  For holes.

        This guy might be an asshole but he's funny.

                                SALOME
                  I don't believe this.

        She shrugs and they go in.

        INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                              64

        Musty and cramped.  A portable shower, a dressing table
        and not much else.  Salome takes the snake from around
        her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table.  Deck-
        ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights.

                                DECKARD
                  It that mother real?

                                SALOME
                  Of course he's not real.  You think
                  I'd be working here if I could
                  afford a real snake?

                                DECKARD
                  It's a good job.

                                SALOME
                  You mean the snake.

        Deckard nods.  There's not much costume to take off but
        she's doing it.

                                SALOME
                  The best.

                                DECKARD
                  Does it eat?

                                SALOME
                  Come on.

        His hand reaches out to touch it.  As his fingers make
        contact there's an electric "snap."  He jerks his hand
        back from the shock.

                                SALOME
                  Jeezus!

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                SALOME
                  Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck
                  mine, huh?

        She slides behind the screen and turns on the shower.
        Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room
        like he's inspecting the walls.

                                DECKARD
                  They have their ways of doing
                  their dirty work without the
                  victim knowing what's going on.

        His eyes are moving over everything she's got.

                                DECKARD
                  You'd be surprised what a guy'll
                  go through to get a glimpse of a
                  beautiful body.

                                SALOME
                  I bet I would.

                                DECKARD
                  Little dirty holes the bastards
                  drill in the wall so they can
                  watch a lady undress.

        And to his amazement he actually spots one.  It's down
        low on the wall.  Not a good idea to turn his back on
        work but he can't resist.

                                SALOME
                  And what if somebody did try to
                  'exploit' me?  Who do I go to?

        Through the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat
        legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Me.

                                SALOME
                  And who do I go to about you?

        He looks back.  She's some out of the shower dripping
        nude.  She's taken off her black wig.  Her hair is
        short and blonde.

        Deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit.
        He stares at her a moment too long.

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmmmm?

        Deckard grins and she returns it.

        She takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
        body.  The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue
        flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  Absently,
        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.

                                ZHORA
                  You ever get the feeling things
                  aren't the way they seem?

        Her hand closes around the snake's head.  Deckard sees
        it coming but can't move fast enough.  She strikes him
        so hard it knocks him off his feet.  Before he hits the
        floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  The snake whistles
        through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way.
        It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor.
        He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.

        INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                 65

        Deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through
        a door at the other end of the hall.  He sprints after
        her, arrives at the door and flings it open.  Black-
        ness.  The SOUND of her high heels CLATTER down the
        metal steps.

        EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                       66

        It's raining heavily.

        The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-
        fic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,
        hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur-
        ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly
        lit stands.   Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of
        place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to
        run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can.
        Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping,
        trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
        shelter.

        She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.

        Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
        ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped-
        estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them
        and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop or you're dead!

        She doesn't.  The beam flashes through the air, but
        she's already around the corner.

        With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move
        so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps
        in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a
        stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be-
        hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast.

        The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
        him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-
        tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and
        jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas-
        senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
        face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
        plasters her against the door.

        Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the
        street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast.
        Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands
        over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before
        she dies.

        Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
        over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it.

        Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street,
        trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's
        running fast, but the car is faster.

        As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids
        broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he
        rolls out FIRING.

        Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except...

        The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes
        through.

        It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front-
        ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made
        and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
        Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
        sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's
        laser.  But she doesn't.

        His last shot burns a hole through the base of her
        skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed
        takes what's left of her through the last two windows
        and into the street where she runs into a parked car
        with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
        it.

        Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for-
        ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something
        for everybody and they're coming from all directions.

        Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look.

        It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome
        and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast
        of metal and flesh.

        Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted.  So much commo-
        tion he doesn't notice THREE COPS closing in from
        behind.

                                COP
                  Drop it!

        Deckard has his back to them.  They're fanned out and
        crouched, ready to fire.  Deckard drops his laser.  Two
        of them rush up, spin him around while the third does a
        frisk.

        TWO MORE COPS arrive, wary and wild-eyed, pushing the
        people back -- his is not a good place for cops.

        Deckard's ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking
        him.  With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to
        the SERGEANT covering the action.

                                SERGEANT
                  On your belly!

        Deckard's not in the mood for it.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, Sergeant...

        He's reaching for his ID.  The Cop with the rubber
        billy hits him in the head.

        One thrill after another.  Somebody in the crowd YEOWLS.
        The last thing Deckard hears as he falls.  The Cop
        reaches inside Deckard's coat for the concealed weapon
        they missed, but it's an ID card.  He looks at it for a
        moment, then looks up.

                                COP
                  Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop.

        An embarrassing situation.

                                SERGEANT
                  Clear this fuckin' crowd.

        The Cops start pushing.  And for one split second one
        of the crowd looks a lot like Leon.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT               67

        Your standard low class crapper.  Bryant is planted
        firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
        rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his
        anger.  This is a public place, he doesn't want to
        yell.

                                BRYANT
                  Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't
                  change procedure.  A little known
                  fact can become a well-known fact
                  and part of our job, Deckard, is
                  to make sure that doesn't happen.
                  Now how can be do that if you blow
                  one away in front of a fuckin'
                  audience.

        It's not the sort of question that expects an answer.
        Deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll
        all go away.

                                BRYANT
                  Well?

        Deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel.
        Bryant slaps one in his hand.

                                DECKARD
                  She was gonna get away.

                                BRYANT
                  Then let her get away.  I thought
                  you were a pro -- you're supposed
                  to be a fuckin' tracker!

        Bryant takes a couple of deep breaths.

                                BRYANT
                  I'd say you got a little carried
                  away.

        Deckard's voice is barely audible.

                                DECKARD
                  I didn't like her.

                                BRYANT
                  You didn't like her!?

        He slams the handle on one of the urinals.

                                BRYANT
                  You start liking or disliking
                  andies it's time to hang it up.

        The PLUMPING ROARS and SUCKS and DIES.  There's nothing
        to do but nod.  Deckard nods.  Poor bastard has had a
        rough night.  Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
        hands it to him.  Deckard puts it to his mouth and
        Bryant watches Deckard's Adam's apple like he's count-
        ing the swallows.  Deckard hands it back empty.  Bryant
        caps it, puts it back in his pocket.

                                BRYANT
                  Look, go home.  Get some rest.
                  Take an aspirin.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

        Bryant shuffles out like an old bear.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - BAR - NIGHT                      68

        Cheap whiskey and bad wine.  That's the kind of place
        this is.  It's near closing.  But still a few at the
        bar.  Alcoholic silhouettes.

        In the b.g. Deckard comes down the passage from the
        men's room and stops at the phone.  He gets a number
        out of his pocket and calls it.  As he talks he leans
        against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy.

        Not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
        and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
        himself.

        Deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a
        stool.  The BARTENDER's a big lady with tits like sand
        bags and a voice that plays no favorites.

                                BARTENDER
                  I can't protect your drinks,
                  mister; while you was in the
                  potty, this hummer snatched it.

        Deckard glances at his stool-mate.  A huge MAN, slumped
        over the bar like a beached whale.

                                DECKARD
                  No problem.  Gimme another.

        The whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly
        Russian accent.

                                RUSSIAN
                  Forgive me.  I thought was free
                  drink.  I will pay.

                                DECKARD
                  Forget it.

        But the big man's digging through his pockets.  Deck-
        ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head.
        It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in
        his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your
        heart.  But it's Leon.

                                LEON
                  I think I have no money.

                                DECKARD
                  It's okay.  Forget it.

                                LEON
                  But I would like to buy you drink.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll but you one.  What'll you
                  have?

                                LEON
                  Vodka!

                                DECKARD
                  Shot of vodka, please.

                                LEON
                  Thank you very much.

                                DECKARD
                  My pleasure.

        Deckard brings out his smokes.  Offers one.  Leon takes
        it and they light up.  The drinks come.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach-
        es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and
        slaps that down too.  It's done with such pride that
        Deckard has to look.

                                LEON
                  You want to see my friends?

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry, don't have the time.

                                LEON
                  No problem.

        Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.

                                DECKARD
                  Those cockroaches?

                                LEON
                  Ya.

        Deckard looks interested.  One of them starts to scamp-
        er away, but Leon walls off the next with his huge hand.

                                DECKARD
                  How long you had these guys?

                                LEON
                  Two months.  But this one is not
                  guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

        Leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches
        to hear.

                                LEON
                  Usually Blackie waits until Igor
                  is eating; then, when his back is
                  turned, he tries to take advantage
                  of Anna.

        Deckard nods, definitely interested.  He signals the
        bartender for another round.  The drinks arrive.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Their eyes meet at the bottom.

                                LEON
                  You never saw a cockroach make
                  love?

        Deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to.

        Leon smiles slyly.

                                LEON
                  We will try.

        Leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
        it on the bar.  They both lean down and watch intently.
        The drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches
        are not cooperating.

                                LEON
                  It must be that he is not hungry
                  or maybe she is not hot.

        Leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
        back in their box.  He holds up the last and kisses it.

                                LEON
                  You like to kiss her goodbye.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

                                BARTENDER
                  Make sure you take your girlfriends
                  with you when you leave.

        What neither of them notices is that between Leon's
        fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh.

        Deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.

                                LEON
                  I like you.

                                DECKARD
                  I like you too.

                                LEON
                  One more, eh?

                                DECKARD
                  I gotta piss.

        Deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in
        a stiff wind and stops.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'll piss outside.

        Leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
        the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit.

        EXT. ALLEY - OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                    69

        Deckard reels out.  The door swings shut and he's sober
        as hell and moving fast.  Around the big trash dumpster
        alongside the building, he plasters himself against the
        wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door.  He's in a
        good spot with a perfect line of fire.  Moments go by
        and he's glad for the time to steady himself.  The
        SOUND of his BREATHING, the HUM of the city and the
        quiet.

        Suddenly from behind, Deckard is swept off his feet and
        twirled around in Leon's bear-trap embrace.

        Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls
        out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon is so
        fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand.

        Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the wall.

                                LEON
                  How come you know where Zhora was
                  so quick?

        His hand is lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's
        hair.

                                DECKARD
                  I showed pictures.  Somebody
                  recognized her.  I went to see.

        Deckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run.

                                LEON
                  How old am I?

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.

        The grip tightens and twists.

                                LEON
                  My birthday is April 10, 2015.
                  How long do I live?

                                DECKARD
                  Four years.

        He lets go.

                                LEON
                  More than you.

        Deckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down
        faster, like a hammer.

                                LEON
                  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.

        Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.

                                LEON
                  But that's how it is to be a
                  slave.  The future is sealed off,
                  he grovels, he waits.

        Even hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun,
        but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley.

        Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
        scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot,
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.

                                LEON
                  Sex, reproduction, security, the
                  simple things.  But no way to
                  satisfy them.  To be homesick
                  with no place to go.  Potential
                  with no way to use it.  Lots of
                  little oversights in the Nexus 6.

        He slams Deckard into the wall.

                                LEON
                  I tell you, nothing is worse
                  than having an itch you can never
                  scratch.

        Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles,
        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next
        one.

        Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
        tion of smashing Deckard's skull.

        The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from
        satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his
        neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog.  Dead.

        Rachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there
        looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward
        and drops Deckard's gun by his side.

        Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
        up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her,
        panting, spits blood and almost smiles.

                                DECKARD
                  Like I said, I don't need your
                  help.

        After a long moment, she bends down to touch him.

                                RACHAEL
                  You look terrible, you know that?

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT             70

        He's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast,
        water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking
        just a little wicked in his balmy luxury.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I knew a cop once who was involved
                  in a high-speed chase.  They shot
                  out one of his tires and he went
                  over a cliff at hundred and fifty
                  miles an hour.  They found him in
                  the morning with a broken skull,
                  six fractured ribs and second-
                  degree burns.  On the way to the
                  hospital he made a play for the
                  nurse.

        He takes a drink and clears his throat.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey!  I thought you were supposed
                  to be taking care of me.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  What do you need?

        He doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink.
        Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll,
        and stands there looking down at him.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't just stand there looking at
                  me.  It's not polite.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do you want me to do?

                                DECKARD
                  Sit.

        She sits on the edge of the tub.

                                DECKARD
                  Gimme your arm.

        She's wearing a short-sleeved dress.  It's a long, del-
        icate arm and Deckard holds it, inspecting it like a
        maestro with a Stradivarius.  He looks up at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You ever take a bath with a man
                  before?

                                RACHAEL
                  There's a lot I haven't done with
                  a man before.

        He's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
        her arm.  Starting with her wrist and running the bar
        to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  She
        watches, not quite sure of the ritual.

        He pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould-
        ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under
        her arm into the privacy of her dress.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're getting me wet.

        Oh, yes.  For a moment Deckard stares at her like some
        furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other
        hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            71

        The bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard
        looks like something that was washed up in it.  He's
        spread out flat, face creased and puffed.

        His eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  His
        hands are more reliable.  They search over the bed,
        but find it bare.  He edges his head over the side,
        looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  He
        gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  Then
        sits again, resting his head in his hands.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING           72

        Deckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it.  It's
        been a long night.  Nothing a new tongue and a trans-
        fusion wouldn't put right.  He moves a couple of inches
        to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING        73

        Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on
        his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap
        and having no luck.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  Sorry, I am not in at the moment,
                  but if you'll leave your name and
                  number I'll return your call as
                  soon as I can.

        That's not soon enough.  Deckard hangs up, puts the
        phone on the floor and leans back on the couch.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck you, then.

        INT. MR. DEETCHUM'S APARTMENT - MORNING                 74

        The rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny
        wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at
        the ceiling.  Between crows there's a TAPPING at the
        door.

        You might call this a "barnyard" apartment.  There's
        straw on the floor and several hens roosting against
        the back wall.  The front door opens a few inches and
        Sebastian pokes his head in.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum?  Hello?

        Nobody seems to be home except his chickens.  As Sebas-
        tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose
        charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Now, now, Waddles.

        Seeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder, Waddles
        veers off from the attack.  As Sebastian crosses the
        room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hello, Wrigley.

        He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting
        them into a bowl he's brought.  He puts down the bowl
        and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the
        payment and puts the money on a plate.  He's about to
        leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very
                  good care of you people.

        Pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser
        with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets
        his bowel of eggs and leaves.

        Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for
        a long drink.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S FLOOR - MORNING             75

        Sebastian arrives on his floor, walks down the hall to
        his apartment, opens the door, walks in.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        76

        He turns to close door, comes face to face with Roy
        Batty.  Sebastian drops his bowl of eggs.  Batty's
        hand flashes out and catches it.

                                BATTY
                  Whoops.

        Smiling, Batty hands them back to Sebastian, who is
        too startled to speak.

        Pris runs up and gives Batty and Mary a big hug, steps
        back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen-
        ager.

                                PRIS
                  This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

                                BATTY
                  Hello, glad to meet you.

        He pumps Sebastian's free hand.

                                PRIS
                  And my Aunt Mary.

        Sebastian turns and there's Aunt Mary, modest and warm.

                                PRIS
                  And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian,
                  everybody.

        Sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex-
        cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention.

                                BATTY
                  Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.
                  If you hadn't come along...

                                MARY
                  We were worried to death.  It's
                  awfully kind of you.

        Sebastian is nodding and smiling.

                                BATTY
                  We're not used to the big city.
                  Where we come from it's not so
                  easy to get lost.

                                MARY
                  You certainly have a nice place
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  Well stocked.

        Batty looks around admiringly.  Sebastian mumbles some-
        thing that sounds like "Thank you."

                                PRIS
                  Sebastian doesn't like to go out
                  too much.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I keep a lot of provisions right
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  I like a man who stays put.  An
                  admirable thing to be able to
                  sustain yourself in these times.
                  You live here all by yourself, do
                  you?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, no, not really.  There's
                  Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman,
                  he lives on the first floor.

        Everybody nods.  A long pause.

                                MARY
                  We haven't found it easy, Mr.
                  Sebastian.

        They glance around the room, waiting for Sebastian to
        pick up the ball.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How about breakfast, I was just
                  going to make some.

                                BATTY
                  If it wouldn't be too much of a
                  bother... a little bite to eat
                  would be...

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

                                BATTY
                  Well, actually

                                MARY
                  We're famished.

        Sebastian is truly happy.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Okay, then.  You make yourselves
                  comfortable and I'll bring the
                  food right out.

        He disappears into the kitchen.  Batty looks happy with
        the way things are going.

                                BATTY
                  Charming.

        Pris comes up close.  Her tone muted but demanding.

                                PRIS
                  Well?

        Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even
        more pugnacious.

                                PRIS
                  I want to know what's going on.

        There's a punitive edge to Batty's response.

                                BATTY
                  There's only three of us left.

        Pris is shocked.  Her whisper comes out a hiss.

                                PRIS
                  Then we're stupid and we'll die.

                                BATTY
                  Not if everybody is doing their
                  job here at home.  How are things
                  at home?

        A little spotted pig on the table sits up.

                                PIG
                  Home again, jiggidy jig.

        They all turn and stare at the pig.  Batty is delighted.

                                PRIS
                  I don't trust him.  I don't think
                  he knows what he's doing.

        The BELL-TONE from the microwave goes off in the kitchen.

                                BATTY
                  He knows what he's doing.

                                MARY
                  If he won't cooperate?

                                BATTY
                  Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants
                  to be appreciated.  We'll
                  appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

        INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR AND ROOM - DAY                   77

        Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an
        iron lung.  A little above his head, facing him, is a
        bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions.

        Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend.

        Holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't
        move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate
        the canary.

                                DECKARD
                  How are you doing, old man?

        Holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper
        that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm
                  not really great, but I feel just
                  great.  How you like my new suit?

                                DECKARD
                  Well, you don't have to worry
                  about getting it wrinkled.

        Holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little
        spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't make me laugh.  It makes me
                  pee.

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                HOLDEN
                  Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee.
                  So how are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm doing okay.

                                HOLDEN
                  From what I hear you're doing
                  great.  Bryant tells me you're
                  going like a god damn one-man
                  army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.
                         (pause)
                  But that's what I wanted to talk
                  to you about.

                                HOLDEN
                  Money?

                                DECKARD
                  No.  I got a problem.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let's hear it.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'm starting to empathize
                  with these Nexus-sixes.

        Holden giggles.  Starts to laugh again.  A blue light
        on the panel begins to turn very bright.  They both
        notice it.

                                DECKARD
                  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm taking a piss.

        They wait for the light to abate.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let me ask you something, Deck.
                  You been having intimate relations
                  with one of these units?

        Deckard doesn't deny it.  Holden smiles like a cherub.

                                HOLDEN
                  That's what I thought... one of
                  the liabilities of the trade --
                  you has sex with your prey, old
                  buddy.  That's bound to create
                  problems, unless you're a black
                  widow.

        Deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling.

                                DECKARD
                  What about -- not sex -- but love?

        Holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of
        his voice, but he can't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Love is just another name for sex.
                  Love is sexy and sex is lovely --
                  I don't care what you call it, an
                  android can't have it.

                                DECKARD
                  These aren't just...

                                HOLDEN
                  I know what they are, Deck --
                  Look, maybe they can pretend to
                  feel, but far as the raw, hot
                  emotions of the old heart -- no
                  way.

        Holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.

                                HOLDEN
                  Believe me, take it from an old
                  pro, no matter how good we get,
                  we're never gonna make an
                  artificial anything that can
                  feel.  It's a contradiction.
                  You might as well go fuck your
                  washing machine.

        Holden laughs, Deckard doesn't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Just go out there and keep up
                  the good work.

        Holden's whispers have become harder to hear.

                                HOLDEN
                  Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting
                  sleepy.  It's been good talking
                  to you.

        Deckard stands.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        But he's already asleep.  Deckard stands there a moment
        looking at him, then walks out.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          78

        He's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative.
        There's a SOUND.  His eyes move to the door.  Those
        locks are opening again.  Rachael comes in.  Looks
        surprised to see him.  Him too.

                                RACHAEL
                  I told you I'd come back.

                                DECKARD
                  You did?

                                RACHAEL
                  You didn't hear me.  You were
                  sleeping.

        He likes that.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you glad I'm here?

        He is.  She's spunky.  Hasn't seen this place in the
        daytime.  Pleased, he watched her move around the mess.
        She spots a little framed photograph.  Picks it up.
        It's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail.

                                RACHAEL
                  Who is this?

                                DECKARD
                  Me and my dad.

                                RACHAEL
                  Where is he?

                                DECKARD
                  Dead.

                                RACHAEL
                  Oh.

        She puts it down and comes to him.

                                RACHAEL
                  How come you're not on the job?

                                DECKARD
                  I am.  Part of my job is to sit
                  on a couch and try and figure
                  things out.

                                RACHAEL
                  How are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  Not too good.

        She sits next to him.

        Pleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight
        ahead.  He looks at her.  She looks at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do people do in the afternoon?

                                DECKARD
                  If they are smart, they take
                  naps.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAY                            79

        They're under the sheet.  Rachael is on her back, look-
        ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over
        the pillow.  Deckard lies next to her, a man studying
        a treasure.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you dream?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  Sometimes.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wish I could.

        His hand moves over her shoulder.

                                DECKARD
                  Wishing is a kind of dreaming.

        His hand goes under the sheet.

                                RACHAEL
                  I mean asleep.

        She feels good.  He moves closer.

                                RACHAEL
                  Did you cry when your father
                  died?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's another thing I can't
                  do.

        He kisses her lightly on the cheek.

                                RACHAEL
                  Nobody is freer than when he
                  dreams.  I read that.

                                DECKARD
                  It wasn't very good last night,
                  was it?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know, I have nothing
                  to compare it to.  I guess I
                  thought there was something
                  more to it.

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know... I think I missed
                  something.

                                DECKARD
                  Like?

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm not sure.  Is there a
                  secret?

        Her face is close.  She's looking right at him.  Her
        lips are right there.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.  If there is I'd
                  like to find it.

        Slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her
        body.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        80

        Batty, Pris and Mary sit at the table staring at their
        host.  Sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to
        his mouth, looking from face to face.  Although nothing
        is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at
        home with them as he is with his animoids.

                                BATTY
                  Why are you staring at us?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're just all so... so different.

        Batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and
        Sebastian is certainly getting it.

                                BATTY
                  What, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're androids.

        A long pause.

                                PRIS
                  What makes you think so?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're all so perfect.

        Sebastian is smiling from ear to ear.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What generation are you?

                                BATTY
                  Nexus - 6.
        
        Sebastian whistles.  Mary's head is shaking slightly.
        Pris gets up and moves to the couch.  Batty couldn't
        be more pleased.

                                BATTY
                  We can trust Sebastian, ladies.
                  He's been working with mechanisms
                  all his life.  He's a wizard and
                  a very perceptive man.

        Sebastian looks like a kid on Christmas Eve.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Could you...

        His voice is trembling.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Show me something?

                                BATTY
                  Like what?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Like...

        Like a million things, but he's too excited to think of
        one.

                                BATTY
                  We're not computers, Sebastian,
                  we're physical.

        Pris perks up proudly.

                                PRIS
                  I think, therefore I am.

                                BATTY
                  Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

        It's a command Pris is pleased to obey.  She sits quiet-
        ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper.
        Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming.

        Those hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster
        than the eye can see and slam down on either side of
        her, digging into the material with such ferocity that
        Sebastian jumps.  She plunges into the guts of the couch
        up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff-
        ing.  Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like
        an angel.

        Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
        he's just seen the devil.  He laughs nervously, glad
        that the devil is a friend.

                                BATTY
                  We have a lot in common.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You mean that you can't come here
                  and I can't go there?

                                BATTY
                  Not only that, but we have smiliar
                  problems.  Accelerated decrepitude.
                  But we don't want to die quite yet.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Of course not.

                                BATTY
                  You could help us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I don't know much about biomechanics,
                  Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out
                  of my league.

                                BATTY
                  If we don't find help soon, Pris
                  hasn't got long to live.

        Sebastian sneaks a glance.  Pris is staring at him with
        big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved
        but helpless.

                                BATTY
                  What about your friend, the man
                  who owns this building?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Dr. Tyrell?

        Batty nods.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He's not really my friend.  I just
                  do a job for him now and then.

                                BATTY
                  Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He could?

                                BATTY
                  His company made us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'd be happy to mention it to him.

                                BATTY
                  Be better if I could talk to him
                  in person.  But he's not an easy
                  man to get to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No.

                                BATTY
                  When do you deliver your project?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  This afternoon.

        Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's
        eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Will you help us?

        There's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he
        wanted to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.

        Pris sits up smiling.  Mary sighs a breath of relief
        and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude.

                                BATTY
                  I'm sure glad you found us,
                  Sebastian.  What do you think,
                  Mary?

                                MARY
                  I don't think there is another
                  human being in this whole world
                  who would have helped us.

                                BATTY
                  Pris?

        Pris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him.

        That has a lot of impact.  Sebastian looks around try-
        ing to keep the tears from coming.

                                BATTY
                  You're our best and only friend.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY                  81

        Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's
        shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around
        the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a
        man who died a voluptuous death.

                                RACHAEL
                  When was the last time you cleaned
                  this place?

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmm?

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever cleaned your
                  apartment?

                                DECKARD
                  Don't be fooled by appearances.

                                RACHAEL
                  It appears to be dirty -- why don't
                  you get somebody?

        He rolls over to admire her legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Because they would ruin the
                  arrangement.

        He kisses the back of her thigh.

                                RACHAEL
                  They could clean around the
                  arrangement.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like people snooping around
                  my stuff.

        He kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the
        bathroom.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  There's a vacuum in the front room
                  closet is you wanna give it a try.

        Rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into
        the front room and opens the closet door.  The vacuum is
        not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  As
        she starts to plug it in --

                                DECKARD
                  Oh no, don't do that.

        He's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway.

                                RACHAEL
                  But if I don't plug it in how can
                  I...

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind the plug, just go
                  through the motions.

                                RACHAEL
                  But then how can you...

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like the noise.  Just
                  practice.  Practice makes perfect.

        She stares at him like he's nuts.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me
                  how you would do it.

        Reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the
        thing.

                                DECKARD
                  How about under the couch there.
                  Come on.

        She bends over to get it.  Deckard pulls up a chair and
        sits down with his chin in his hands.  She looks back
        at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  This feels stupid.

                                DECKARD
                  Good for a smart girl to feel
                  stupid.  Part of your education.

        She drops the vacuum and sits on the floor.  Deckard
        gets up and comes towards her.  Her eyes travel halfway
        down his sheet and she leaves.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're sick, Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  I never felt better.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             82

        Mansion and opulent grounds.  Sebastian's humble truck
        parked among richer relations, including a spinner and
        a 1928 Dusenberg.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION - DUSK                              83

        The den.  It contains a collection of big game trophies,
        and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and
        proper with an "egg" the size of a basketball in his
        lap.

        Old Hannibal Chew was right, the rich make you wait.
        Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between
        the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION POOL - DUSK                         84

        Tyrell's young WIFE sits on the diving board watching
        her husband in the pool with their youngest TOT.  And
        two older LADS swim around trying to outdo each other
        for their dad's attention.

        From the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the
        fun, then continues with a tray of mugs towards the
        house.

        EXT. PLATEAU - DUSK                                     85

        And beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds, a
        figure stands watching, waiting like a bird of prey.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             86

        On a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, Tyrell
        turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom.
        The moment is sweetened by the LOW PLAINTIVE BELLOW of
        one of the animals.

        He strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro-
        ceeds up the steps and into his mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 87

        Next to a tray of cookies and milk, Sebastian sits pa-
        tiently with the "egg" in his lap.  As the door opens
        he gets to his feet expectantly.  It's STYLES, Tyrell's
        bodyguard.  He could play the Giant in Jack and The
        Beanstalk.

                                STYLES
                  Okay, I'll take that now.

        Sebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but
        Styles takes it and is almost through the door when
        Sebastian stops him.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Wait!

        He almost forgot.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Can't fly without the pilot.

        Sebastian hands him a little box.  Styles stuffs it in
        his pocket and shuts the door behind him.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - NIGHT                            88

        Motionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat-
        ues in the grass.  Suddenly they swing their shaggy
        heads to watch something pass.

        In the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious
        beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DINING ROOM - NIGHT                         89

        It's a medieval-sized hall.  The piece de resistance is
        an 18th Century, English painting of an Arab stallion,
        gleaming like coal over the CRACKLING fireplace.

        The entire family is seated at the table which glitters
        for the festive occasion.  Presents gathered around the
        oldest child.

        Styles hands the "egg" to Tyrell.  A hush falls over
        the table.  This is Dad's big present.  Tyrell sets is
        down before the boy.

        IAN is a fresh, slim lad who is ten today.  He looks up
        at his father, then, beaming, pries open the "egg's"
        hinged lid.  Tyrell's hand goes to his pocket and the
        griffon steps out of the shell.

                                IAN
                  Oh!

        Basically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage,
        the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no
        more than eight pounds.  It cranes its neck and testing
        its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the
        edge of the table and into the air.

        The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats
        its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling.  Turn-
        ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a
        dive.

        Delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon
        swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length
        of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over
        the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan.

        Reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and
        flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads
        its tail and comes in for an awkward landing.  They're
        laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and
        knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian.

                                IAN
                  Papa!  Did you make this?

                                TYRELL
                  No.  We can make man, but not a
                  griffon.

        He bends down and kisses his wife.

                                TYRELL
                  Have to give the cottage industry
                  a chance too.

        Pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 90

        Tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk.  Sebastian
        hands down the invoices.  Tyrell glances over them and
        writes out a check.

        He looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against
        the wall, by the door.  For a fraction of a second he's
        shocked, but recovers fast.

                                TYRELL
                  A friend of yours, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes, this is someone who wants to
                  talk to you, Dr. Tyrell.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Oh?

        Very slowly Tyrell's hand moves towards the back side
        of the desk.

                                BATTY
                  To act without understanding could
                  lead to the very thing the act
                  seeks to avoid.

        What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning.  Tyrell
        decides to heed it.

                                BATTY
                  A little talk it all I need.

        Tyrell looks at Sebastian.  Considers consequences.
        Back to Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to talk in private
                  then.

        Batty thinks it over.

                                BATTY
                  Yeah.  It might be better if we
                  talk in private, Sebastian.  Why
                  don't you go home.

                                TYRELL
                  Here's your check, my boy.  Thank
                  you.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you, Dr. Tyrell.  I'll see
                  you later.

        He slips out closing the door behind him.  Opens it
        again and sticks his head it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Was everything okay?

                                TYRELL
                  Just beautiful.

        He's gone.

        If Tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing
        it.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm surprised you didn't come to
                  me sooner.

                                BATTY
                  It's not an easy thing to meet
                  your maker.

                                TYRELL
                  And what can he do for you?

                                BATTY
                  Can the maker repair what he makes?

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to be modified?

                                BATTY
                  Had in mind something a little more
                  radical.

                                TYRELL
                  What's the problem?

                                BATTY
                  Death.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm afraid that's a little out of
                  my...

        Batty cuts in with a whisper.

                                BATTY
                  I want more life, fucker.

                                TYRELL
                  Come here.

        Batty walks forward.

                                TYRELL
                  Sit down.

        Batty does.

                                TYRELL
                  The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.
                  To make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system, at least by men, makers
                  or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence
                  can't be revised once it's
                  established.

                                BATTY
                  Why?

                                TYRELL
                  Because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation give
                  rise to revertant colonies -- like
                  rats leaving a sinking ship.  The
                  ship sinks.

                                BATTY
                  What about E.M.S. recombination?

                                TYRELL
                  We've already tried it -- ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
                  creates a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table.

        Batty nods grimly.

                                BATTY
                  Then a repressor protein that blocks
                  the operating cells.

                                TYRELL
                  Wouldn't obstruct replication, but
                  it does give rise to an error in
                  replication, so that the newly
                  formed DNA strand carries a
                  mutation and you're got a virus
                  again... but all this is academic
                  -- you are made as good as we could
                  make you.

                                BATTY
                  But not to last.

                                TYRELL
                  Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are
                  made to last -- as least they were.
                  But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari.
                  A high strung racing car -- built
                  to win, not to last.

        Batty smiles bitterly.

                                TYRELL
                  Also you're too valuable to
                  experiment with.

                                BATTY
                  I am?

        Tyrell can't help a flash of pride.

                                TYRELL
                  The bast of all possible androids.
                  We're proud of our prodigal son --
                  glad you're returned.  You're quite
                  a prize.

        Shoulders hunched, Batty looks down, an uncharacteristic
        note of guilt in his voice.

                                BATTY
                  I've done some questionable things.

                                TYRELL
                  Also extraordinary things.

                                BATTY
                  Nothing the God of biomechanics
                  wouldn't let you in heaven for.

        They share a laugh.  In spite of himself, there's a look
        of relief in Tyrell's face as Batty extends his hand.
        Tyrell takes it and they shake.  The reverence in Bat-
        ty's eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile.  The smile
        turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
        crack.  Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty
        stifles it.

        Tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking
        into his face.  Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's
        head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the
        man's head like a melon.  The mess is not small.

        Palms up, like a surgeon, Batty walks to the drapes and
        wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out
        of the room.

        INT. TYRELL - HALL TO KITCHEN - NIGHT                   90A

        Styles is coming down the hall.  He sees Batty coming
        towards him.  Styles looks at him curiously, this is not
        one of the guests.  As they close, Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  Could you tell me where the
                  bathroom is?

        Styles doesn't get a chance to answer.  Batty's hand has
        torn into his crotch.  The man is lifted off the floor,
        up the wall and held a moment.  Whatever is encased in
        his pelvis is pulverized.  Batty lets go.  Styles hits
        the floor.  He died of shock.  Grinding his teeth, Batty
        continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES.

        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                91

        The birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit.  They're
        waiting for Dad.  Mrs. Tyrell looks around to find Batty
        observing from the doorway.

        A little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor-
        porate wife, she smiles.

                                MRS. TYRELL
                  May I help you?

        Batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets.

        INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    92

        In the sink the faucet is on.  The water pink with
        blood.  Batty is washing his hands.

        A portly maid emerges from the pantry.  Batty looks up.
        She stops, embarrassed at being caught.  Her eyes no-
        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
        door.  When she looks back, Batty is right in front of
        her.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                          93

        Books scattered on the bed.  Rachael sitting cross-
        legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite
        shots of nature.  Deckard is next to her, watching her
        like a lover, like a father.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She'd never seen the great outdoors.
                  Never even seen books on the
                  subject.  She went through
                  everything I had, and we talked.
                  And there were subjects we didn't
                  discuss and they were words we
                  didn't say, I couldn't say, like
                  death, like future, like real.  But
                  it was hard because she was curious
                  and full of questions.  She was
                  more alive than anyone I'd ever
                  known.

        She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with
        no need to comment.  It's in her eyes.  She stares at
        him, a revelation taking shape.

                                RACHAEL
                  You and I are good friends, huh?

        He considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the
        wonder of it.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's so easy.

        Convinced and not convinced, he nods his head.  She
        laughs at his solemnity.  She's irresistible.  Deckard's
        pretty irresistible himself.

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever known anybody a long
                  time?

                                DECKARD
                  You mean a woman?

                                RACHAEL
                  Uh-huh.

                                DECKARD
                  What's a long time?

                                RACHAEL
                  Ten years.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.  Nobody could stand me that
                  long.

        The CHIME on the PHONE next to the bed GOES OFF.  He
        reaches out and brings it to his ear.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  She's not with you?

                                DECKARD
                  Who.

        A pause.

                                BRYANT
                  Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth
                  floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia
                  South.

                                DECKARD
                  Got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his
                  family and half his staff were just
                  massacred.  The cat is about to get
                  out of the bag.  Pressure is
                  definitely on.  The Nexus program
                  is terminated.  When you finish
                  there, locate Nexus designated Rachael
                  and retire.

        Deckard says nothing.

                                BRYANT
                  If you don't, we will.  It has to
                  be total, Deckard.  That's an order
                  from as high as it comes.  Got it?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  I got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Go.

        He hangs up the receiver and gets up.  She watches him
        from the bed.  The gun goes into his belt.  He loads
        the ankle job and straps it on.  She watches every move.

                                RACHAEL
                  Why do you call it retire, why
                  don't you call it murder?

                                DECKARD
                  Because it's not.

                                RACHAEL
                  Don't you think anything that can
                  suffer deserves to be considered?

                                DECKARD
                  Andies only simulate suffering --
                  if they're programmed for it.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you think I simulated what
                  happened between us?

                                DECKARD
                  No, I don't.

        Without looking at her, he puts on his jacket.

        He's standing in the middle of the floor with his back
        to her.  He turns and they're facing one another.
        Neither of them moves.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't leave here.  Don't open the
                  door, don't answer the phone.

                                RACHAEL
                  What difference will it make?

                                DECKARD
                  Just wait here.

        He goes to the door.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what I think?

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  That some of the folks around here
                  are more programmed then me.

        He has to laugh.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what else I think?

                                DECAKRD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  This was the best day of my life.

        He turns and goes through the door.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      94

        Sebastian is putting his work table in order, but his
        mind is not with it and his hands are trembling.

        Batty, Pris and Mary are on the other side of the room
        talking:  their voices low.

                                MARY
                  Let's go while there is still
                  time.

                                BATTY
                  Where?

                                MARY
                  Anywhere.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  What's the point?

                                MARY
                  Not to be trapped.

                                BATTY
                  You underestimate the trap, Mary.

        Sebastian has almost reached the door.

                                BATTY
                  Where are you going, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Just thought I'd...

                                BATTY
                  No, you stay here with us.  Out
                  last night together.

        They all watch.

        Sebastian walks away from the door.

                                BATTY
                  Think of yourself as a light, Mary.
                  Shine before you're turned off.

        She's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to
        Pris.  She and Batty hold a look that burns.

        Sebastian is by the window.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Someone is coming here.

        Batty goes to the window and looks down.

                                BATTY
                  One man.
                         (he smiles)
                  He must be good.

                                MARY
                  Then go get him.

                                BATTY
                  That wouldn't be very sporting.

        Sebastian looks ready to bolt.  Batty puts an arm
        around him.

                                PRIS
                  I want to do it.

                                BATTY
                  Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a
                  little for everybody.  A
                  masterpiece.

        A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Turn out the lights, Pris.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      95

        In the dim, nocturnal light, Deckard crosses into the
        courtyard fronting the building and stops.  He looks
        around.  Nobody there, just silence.

        He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-
        dows off to one side of the entry.

        His head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS.

        Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
        pavement thirty feet below.

        Deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-
        tered window on the next-to-top floor.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT                96

        Not much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he
        crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of
        least exposure.  He looks around.  Elevator and stair-
        well.

        Close to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep-
        ing an eye on the stairwell door.

        Stepping to one side, he hits the button.  The elevator
        door slides open.  He reaches in, presses a button and
        as the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between
        the doors, jamming the operation.

        Deckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the
        lobby floor.  He pauses a moment in front of the stair-
        well door, then pushes it open and:

        INT. STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97

        Steps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he
        spins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in-
        to the figure hovering to his left.

        The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into
        the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his
        chest... but he was already dead.

        Deckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the
        old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were
        feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard
        gets to his feet.

        The stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot
        touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters
        the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young
        girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY
        STOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his
        laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,
        descends the basement stairs.

        INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT                                   98

        At the bottom he faces a corridor.  The FAINT HUM OF
        MACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end.
        The HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there.
        Each door is fitted with a small window.  Deckard
        steps to the side and peers through.

        INT. GYM - NIGHT                                        99

        It's a gym.  The mirror-lined walls are cracked and
        tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.
        The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two
        weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away
        like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.

        She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the
        shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.
        Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly
        swaying.

        Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
        the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,
        keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
        door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-
        ing.  Deckard's in his element.

        Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It
        isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his
        eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.

        It's not something he has time to consider.  In the
        mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.
        Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,
        crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
        neck.

        Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't
        notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood
        to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.
        As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'
        fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens
        like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his
        eyes roll back into his head.

                                PRIS
                  Naughty, naughty.

        She lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot
        into his back.  He's propelled fifteen feet across the
        room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.
        Pris flies off the rings and comes at him.

        Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-
        ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,
        she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the
        floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches
        out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
        the machine.

        It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally
        an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing
        on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A
        bad place for flesh and bone.

        But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-
        year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds
        his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull
        his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but
        it's welded in hers.

        His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,
        wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
        his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard
        hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up
        and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard
        rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
        driver.

        Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.
        Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him
        across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of
        work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.

        He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.
        It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like
        it was ice, weight stand in tow.

        Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces
        it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound
        dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It
        knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his
        foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets
        her with a roundhouse in the face.

        She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell
        over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her
        life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts
        him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and
        lands in a heap.

        No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She
        rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-
        head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down
        for the kill, she freezes.

        Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.
        As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.

        He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and
        takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming
        her rage.  He FIRES as she comes.

        The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but
        her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily
        in front of her as she charges forward.

        He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a
        rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
        next to Deckard.  Dead.

        He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls
        over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-
        gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.
        The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It
        might not sound like a war cry, but it is.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   100

        Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors
        and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                  101

        Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his
        loads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shoot
        the next thing that moves and find out later if he was
        right or wrong.

        INT. STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT                   101A

        On the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyes
        move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.
        None.  He continues up the stairs.

        INT. NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT                                102

        On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.
        Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the
        hall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.
        Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If
        somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.

        He kicks the door open and dives through head first
        and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the
        far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's
        a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both
        closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No
        response from either door.

        Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly
        Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the
        closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.

        Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand
        out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
        it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed
        monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her
        body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.
        Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary
        falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.

        Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
        closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes
        off her.

        Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his
        hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in
        his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.

        A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.

        A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.
        A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
        gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the
        couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet
        in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the
        apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster
        dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:

                                DECKARD
                  Hello, Roy.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103

        Deckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time,
        he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor.
        He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door,
        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG.
        The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is
        empty.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104

        Moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he
        gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he
        turns the know and pushed open the door.

        INT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105

        Except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's
        nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to-
        wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds
        like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the
        hallway.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106

        Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the
        hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap
        and gym shoes, he's nude.

                                BATTY
                  You wanna play?

        Deckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway.
        Pops out again.

                                BATTY
                  Not very sporting to fire on an
                  unarmed opponent.  I thought you
                  were supposed to be good.  Aren't
                  you the man?!

        The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman-
        che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his
        insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol-
        len, trembling from the thrill of it.

                                BATTY
                  This is how we do it up there, lad!
                  Come on!

        In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the
        hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast
        that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur
        crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh.

        Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact
        of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be-
        hind him.

        He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head.
        Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face.
        Batty kneels next to him.

                                BATTY
                  Not hurt, are you?  You better get
                  it up or I'm going to have to kill
                  you.  Unless you're alive you can't
                  play.  And if you don't play, you
                  don't get to be alive.

        Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales
        and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with
        his chest and starts to push.

                                BATTY
                  That's the spirit.

        Like a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's
        on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the
        doors.

        Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and
        picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall,
        towards the jeering voice.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Come on, Deckard, show me what you
                  got!  I'm right here on the other
                  side of the door.  But you gotta
                  shoot straight 'cause I'm fast!

        Deckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and
        FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty.

        INT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107

        The full length mirror on the other side of the room
        SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand
        and steps in closer.

                                BATTY
                  Straight doesn't seem to be good
                  enough.

        They're face to face.

                                BATTY
                  You don't have a chance, do you?

        In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops
        his head to the side.

                                BATTY
                  Looks like I'm gonna have to scale
                  it down for you.  Give you a
                  handicap.  I won't run through any
                  more walls.  Okay?  I promise to
                  use the doors.  Okay?

        Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud-
        denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out
        the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar
        and rams his head into the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Come on, let's use that brain!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108

        He drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his
        head into the wall again.

                                BATTY
                  Think!  We need a little
                  resilience around here!

        He yanks him further and bashes his head again.

                                BATTY
                  Where are those balls of yours?!
                  Let's see a little bravery!

        The storm passes.

        Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry.

                                BATTY
                  That was irrational of me -- not
                  to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't
                  happen again.

        He drops him.

                                BATTY
                  I'll be down the hall when you're
                  ready.

        Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors.

        Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo-
        ment, then punches it with his fist.

        On his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath
        so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No
        sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby.
        He doesn't bother.

        Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He
        had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but
        he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns.

        On the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land-
        ing below, looking up at him.

                                BATTY
                  Where you going?

        He wait a moment for Deckard's answer.

                                BATTY
                  No cheating.  A promise is a
                  promise.  I'll honor the
                  handicapped, but we gotta play on
                  the top floor.  You go get your
                  laser gun now.  And I'll give you
                  a few seconds before I come.

        Deckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles.

        Deckard's running down the corridor.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  One!

        Halfway down the hall he finds his laser.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Two!

        Deckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment
        above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard
        considers it.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  No fair jumping through holes.  You
                  might get hurt doing that!  THREE!

        Deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door
        and goes in.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109

        His eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage.
        He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is
        dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails
        protruding.  Too small.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110

        Batty's coming up the steps.

                                BATTY
                  Five!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111

        Deckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers
        the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with
        a line to the door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112

        Batty's coming down the center, listening at the doors.

                                BATTY
                  Six!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113

        Deckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at
        his hand.  It's trembling.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Seven!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114

        Batty's standing in front of a door, listening.

                                BATTY
                  Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in
                  here, I don't think.  Eight!

        He goes to the next door.

                                BATTY
                  Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like
                  it.  Nine!

        Batty moves to the next.  The door to Deckard.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      115

        Deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk
        about a hair trigger... Silence.  Batty's FEET are heard
        CREAKING AWAY.  Deckard looks around.  Runs a hand over
        the wall behind him.  Batty's FEET COME BACK.  A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Ten!

        The door explodes!

        A shape hurtles across the room.  Deckard pivots, fol-
        lowing it with RAPID FIRE.  It's a TV.  He spins back.
        but Batty's already on him.  He gets one SHOT off be-
        fore Batty's got his hand.  There's a hole over Batty's
        right eye.  Blood running down his face, dripping on
        Deckard.  The right side of his face isn't working too
        good.  The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut --
        his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.

                                BATTY
                  One point for you.

        The would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes
        it more malignant.  He throws Deckard against the far
        wall.  Deckard FIRES.  Hits Batty in the shoulder.

                                BATTY
                  Ho ho!  Try it again!

        He comes at Deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in
        fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement
        as Deckard tries to get a shot, FIRING AWAY until his
        laser's empty.  Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up
        against him.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Don't you like me?
                  I'm what we've made!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           116

        He's backing Deckard out the door.  Deckard trips and
        falls.  There's fear on his face.  The strength is gone.
        Something is starting to crack.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover
                  of Faster, Bigger and Better?!

        Deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.

                                BATTY
                  It's time to die.

        Deckard throws the laser at him.  It misses.  Batty
        throws his head back and laughs.  A one-eyed colossus
        about to eat the world.  Suddenly he stops.  His eye
        moves over the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Ah!

        He reaches out and pinches something.  His lips compress
        as he yanks it out of the wall.  It's a ten-penny nail.

        He holds it out to Deckard and drops it.  Deckard
        catches it.

                                BATTY
                  That's for you.

        One side of Batty's face smiles savagely.

                                BATTY
                  Stick it in your ear and push.
                  If that doesn't work, try the
                  eye.

        Deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at
        his executioner.

                                BATTY
                  Believe me, it'll be better
                  for you than what I'm about
                  to do.

        Batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire
        his victim to more action.  It doesn't look like it.

                                BATTY
                  Well?

        Deckard springs to his feet and bolts.  But instead of
        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
        door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT                   117

        Provocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei-
        surely towards the door.  Deckard's terrified scream
        and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him.  Batty speeds
        up and moves into the room.

        The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out,
        bellowing in the wind.

                                BATTY
                  Crap.

        He walks up to the window.  Deckard comes away from the
        wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed
        at the base of Batty's skull.  Batty starts to lean
        over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he
        knows.  He spins...

        Deckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls
        like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.

        Deckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his
        head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe
        again.
        
        On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's
        ankle.

        With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
        banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-
        ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the
        hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops
        the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead
        fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.

        Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He
        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           118

        Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along.
        He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the
        last couple feet to the stairwell.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119

        Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's
        body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,
        then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-
        ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the
        edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds
        and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As
        Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the
        railing.

        Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement
        floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost
        four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.
        
        With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-
        ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's
        fingers are starting to slip.

        His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over
        Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything
        he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The
        thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.

        The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but
        Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.
        He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.
        He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
        left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-
        hand grip.

        Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't
        be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over
        the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
        onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.

        And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly
        clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's
        his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware
        of.

        Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one
        foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120

        Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into
        the morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has
        begun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
        very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard
        is glad to see it.

        For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
        breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the
        street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to
        fall.

        Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-
        lapses on the front seat.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121

        In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a
        chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The
        only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING
        that comes from the bed.

        Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies
        sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.

        Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down
        at her.

        Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
        the bed.

        Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.

        EXT. COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY                        122

        Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He
        and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion-
        al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold
        shine of an icy dream.

        The clouds overhead are soft and swift.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She wanted to go to a place I knew.
                  Out of the city.  Like one of those
                  pictures she saw.  Where there were
                  trees but no buildings.

        Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream
        by.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  We had a good time.  She told me a
                  funny story and I taught her a
                  song.  A song about monkeys and
                  elephants.  And it made us laugh so
                  hard we couldn't sing.

        EXT. WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY                              123

        Deckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and
        hushed before them.

        Down an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light
        slanting through the clean, hard limbs.

        The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in
        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.

        Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her
        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking
        lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she
        stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard.
        Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on
        knowing.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        124

        Deckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly,
        mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  His
        gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears
        running down his pale cheeks.

        But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted
        snow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into the
        silence of the freezing white landscape.

        EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                    125

        Deckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along like
        some metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of the
        long, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-
        ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silence
        astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN.

        INT. CAR - NIGHT                                        126

        Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-
        ing straight ahead.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I told myself over and over again,
                  if I hadn't done it, they would
                  have.

                  I didn't go back to the city, not
                  that city, I didn't want the job.

                  She said the great advantage of
                  being alive was to have a choice.
                  And she chose.  And a part of me
                  was almost glad.  Not because she
                  was gone but because this way they
                  could never touch her.

                  As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,
                  but he wasn't dead.  For a long
                  time I wanted to kill him.  But
                  what was the point?  There were too
                  many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.
                  Maybe real and unreal could never
                  be separated.  The secret never
                  found.  But I got as close with
                  her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd
                  stay with me a long time.  I guess
                  we made each other real.

        And the ruby lights of Deckard's car disappear into
        the darkness.
        
        
        
        					THE END

                                ****************

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION LOCKER ROOM - DAY               1

        THE EYE                                                 2

        It's magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of green
        and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments
        surround the undulating center.

        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuations of the iris.

        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
        looks like an over-stuffed kid.  "LEON" it says on
        his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's
        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
        his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed
        in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans
        whir above their heads.

                                LEON
                  Okay if I talk?

        Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                LEON
                  I kinda get nervous when I
                  take tests.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't move.

                                LEON
                  Sorry.

        He tries not to move but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                LEON
                  Already had I.Q. test this year --
                  but I don't think I never had a...

                                HOLDEN
                         (cutting in)
                  Reaction time is a factor in this,
                  so please pay attention.  Answer
                  quickly as you can.

        Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.
        Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke
        response.

                                HOLDEN
                  You're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you look down and see a...

                                LEON
                  What one?

        It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                HOLDEN
                  What?

                                LEON
                  What desert?

                                HOLDEN
                  Doesn't make any difference what
                  desert -- it's completely
                  hypothetical.

                                LEON
                  But how come I'd be there?

                                HOLDEN
                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you
                  want to be by yourself -- who
                  knows.  So you look down and
                  see a tortoise.  It's crawling
                  towards you...

                                LEON
                  A tortoise.  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  Know what a turtle is?

                                LEON
                  Of course.

                                HOLDEN
                  Same thing.

                                LEON
                  I never seen a turtle.

        He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                LEON
                  But I understand what you mean.

                                HOLDEN
                  You reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, Leon.

        Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
        in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                LEON
                  You make these questions, Mr.
                  Holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not
                  without your help.  But you're
                  not helping.

        Leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                LEON
                  Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

                                HOLDEN
                  I mean you're not helping!
                  Why is that, Leon?

        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside
        of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS
        a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach.
        Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes
        through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean
        as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the
        bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the
        floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he
        stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,
        FIRES at the machine on the table.

        There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff
        is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as
        Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins
        to blink, faint but steady.

        EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                     3

        The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe
        the end, of the beginning of a day.

        The train that follows, cuts through the night at 400
        miles an hour.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      4

        No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long,
        insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed
        lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for
        the passenger half way down.

        His eyes closed, head rested against the glass.  Ten
        years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a
        track man or a welter-weight.  The body looks it, but
        the face has seen some time -- not all of it good.

        INT. TRAIN - REFRESHMENT DISPENSER - NIGHT              5

        Deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the
        mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      6

        Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and
        drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
        sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up
        staring at his reflection in the window.  Runs a
        hand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leans
        closer and peers through the glass.

        Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SAN
        ANGELES, THREE MINUTES.

        EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                   7

        The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with-
        out a sound.  Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard
        disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the
        sweltering night.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   8

        Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his
        shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow
        passage under orbs of yellow light.

        EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT                                   9

        Deckard unlocks his car and gets in.  Turns the ig-
        nition and hits a sensor.  The dash console glows
        and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
        things off.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  It was 97 degrees in the city and
                  no hope of improvement.  Not bad
                  if you're a lizard.  But two hours
                  earlier I was drinking Acquavit
                  with an Eskimo lady in North East
                  Alaska.  That's a tough change to
                  make.  It was so good, I didn't
                  want to leave, so I left a day
                  early.

        A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the
        panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
        sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and
        caller.  The last one is repeated five times.  Deckard
        sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.

                                DECKARD
                  Contact.  This is Blade Runner One
                  calling Com-fast 27.

        The SOUND OF A CHIME precedes the mechanical female
        voice that answers.

                                VOICE
                  Blade Runner One, stand by please.

        A pause.  Followed by a husky male voice.

                                VOICE
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  Yah, Gaff.

                                GAFF (VOICE)
                  Where the hell you been?

                                DECKARD
                  You know where I been.  I been on
                  vacation.

                                GAFF
                  Next time you go on vacation,
                  do me a favor, let us know where
                  it is.

                                DECKARD
                  What's up?

                                GAFF
                  Holden got hit.

        There is a pause.  That was bad news.

                                DECKARD
                  Bad?

                                GAFF
                  Severed spine.  You'd better get
                  in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll see you in a minute.

        The ENGINE REVS, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
        the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot.

        INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT                        10

        An enormous grey vault of a building.  A businesslike
        Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief-
        case and police ID pinned to his coat.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6,
                  The Tyrell Corporation's new pride
                  and joy.  Holden was administering
                  the Voight-Kampff test when one
                  nailed him.

        The door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks
        through.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The Nexus-6 must be fast because
                  Holden was as quick as they come.
                  The report said there were six of
                  them.  Three males and three female.
                  Led by a combat model called Roy
                  Batty.

        INT. INSPECTOR BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT                  11

        The INSPECTOR is in his fifties.  The deep creases in
        his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say
        brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the
        wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe
        trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of
        the desk reading the print-out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  They escaped from the colonies
                  two weeks ago.  Killed twenty-
                  three people and jumped a shuttle.
                  An aerial patrol found the ship
                  in the desert.  No crew.

        Bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
        whiskey.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Bryant's got a liver problem.  A
                  couple years back he handed me a
                  bottle and said have a drink for
                  another man.  I been drinking
                  for him ever since.

        Deckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant
        just poured for him.

                                DECKARD
                  Six, huh?

                                BRYANT
                  Five.  Three nights ago one of
                  them managed to break into the
                  Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two
                  guards and got as far as the
                  Genetic Sector before he got
                  fried going through an electro-
                  field.

                                DECKARD
                  What was he after?

                                BRYANT
                  There wasn't much left of him,
                  so we can't be sure.  But bio-
                  chemical data and morphology records
                  of the Nexus-6 were reported
                  missing.  Going on the possibility
                  they might try to infiltrate we
                  send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
                  tests on the new employees.  Guess
                  he found himself one.

        A grim pause.

                                DECKARD
                  You got a machine on it yet?

                                BRYANT
                  We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that
                  picked up Holden's alarm.  Its
                  guess is that all five are in
                  the city.

                                DECKARD
                  Where do we start?

        Bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.

                                BRYANT
                  The Tyrell Corporation has a
                  demo model.  Check it out on the
                  Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance
                  the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
                  to detect.  If that's the case,
                  everybody's up shit creek.

                                DECKARD
                  What was the cover on the one that
                  got Holden?

                                BRYANT
                  Industrial refuse.

                                DECKARD
                  Garbage man?

        Bryant nods.

                                DECKARD
                  Did personnel have an address on
                  him?

        Bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket,
        copies down a number and hands it over.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll go take a look.

        Deckard stands and holds up his drink.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant
        watches Deckard down the whiskey.  Deckard puts down
        the glass and turns to leave.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The big incentive to emigrate was
                  still free labor.  If the public
                  found out that their door-prizes
                  might kill them, they might not be
                  so hot to go up there.  This was
                  one of the worst one's we had and
                  Bryant was worried.  He wanted to
                  tell me to be discrete or something.
                  But I didn't give him a chance.

        EXT. LEON'S HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT                      12

        An electrical storm is brewing.  Deckard stands out-
        side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,
        as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden
        downpour.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                         13

        A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
        balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;
        Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other
        lower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,
        cramped and darkly alive.

        Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
        crowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating
        as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of
        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.

        A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as
        he turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door
        that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened
        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
        his hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words
        which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.
        The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and
        shuts the door.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                      14

        The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no
        more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
        outs of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the door
        he's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then
        knocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
        opens it.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                15

        An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in
        and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a
        place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
        clean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless
        basin is perfectly folded.

        Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He
        looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.
        The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks
        under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the
        mattress.

        The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.
        Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes
        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
        fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-
        lessness, he lifts off the lid.

        It contains a little stack of photos bound with a
        rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp
        by the balcony window and turns it on.

        A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of
        anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.
        The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the
        sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded
        polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of
        simple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious
        collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies
        them with interest.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               16

        Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands
        in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers
        looking like he'd never been touched by the light of
        day.

        Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,
        watching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearing
        his coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is
        more intent, smarter and angry.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               17

        For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash
        something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears
        into the crowd.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                18

        Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the
        window.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      19

        Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to
        match, but he's a graceful runner.  Looks like he could
        do it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alley
        behind him and he's not out of breath.

        EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT                                  20

        Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto
        a narrow street.  The Asian Quarter.

        INT. CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT                            21

        A seamy as well as steamy little place.  Counter and
        small tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over their
        fuming bowls jabbering and slurping.

        The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-
        D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV
        announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty
        in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes
        a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Choose from a variety of seventy
                  nine different personality types.
                  Each and every one a loyal trouble-
                  free companion given to you upon
                  your arrival absolutely free...

        The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray
        Bolger type gentleman's gentleman who clicks his heels,
        snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the
        next.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  To use as personal body servant
                  to tireless field hand -- the
                  custom tailored humanoid robot,
                  designed especially for your
                  needs.

        The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and
        the woman seated at the table by the window are.

        The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind
        and blue-eyed.  MARY looks like an American dream mom,
        right out of "Father Knows Best."

        The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor,
        short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant,
        but the eyes are grey and chilling.  ROY BATTY is a
        presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what
        goes on around him.

        Leon has just come through the door behind them.  Try-
        ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches
        their table and kneels .  Batty doesn't bother to look
        at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his
        quiet voice.

                                BATTY
                  Did you get your precious 'things'?

                                LEON
                  Somebody was already there.

                                BATTY
                  Police.

                                LEON
                  Just a man.

                                BATTY
                  Police man.

        Leon looks sullen.

                                BATTY
                  Why don't you have a seat.

        There's one next to him.  Leon pulls it over and sits.

                                BATTY
                  Enjoy the view.

        From the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit
        so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem
        almost invisible.  The view they're "enjoying" is
        through the window.  Outside the neon side in the win-
        dow directly across the street says:  HANNIBAL CHEW,
        MEMBERS.

        INT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT                       22

        Chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled
        eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him
        looks like a Charles Dickens invention.

        He's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched
        over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand.  After
        a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent
        smile.

                                CHEW
                  Well, you're right.  This little
                  honey has a couple of defective cones.

        He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his
        client.

        SEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has
        gone too far, too fast.  Premature old age has made
        his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The
        house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  Se-
        bastian is a closet genius.

                                CHEW
                  You're a regular perfectionist,
                  Sebastian.

        Sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic
        Mr. Chew.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  It's gotta be right for my
                  customer.

                                CHEW
                  Your customer, eh?

        Chew snickers and beckons.  Sebastian follows his down
        a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  There's
        a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  Chew
        tugs it on and they go through.  The big door slams
        shut behind them.

        INT. COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                          23

        Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in-
        struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a
        morgue.  The glass-doored compartments in the walls
        look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office
        boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed
        box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into
        the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
        an eye.

        Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered
        to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and
        studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through
        his pockets.

                                CHEW
                  You got a pocket-charger, boy?

        Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like
        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket
        and steps closer.  The back of the eye is touched with
        the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring
        back at them.

                                CHEW
                  Is that good enough for your
                  customer?

        Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods.  Chew reseals the
        eye taking his time.  He can afford to, he's wearing
        his coat.

                                CHEW
                  How much is he paying you?

        In place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat,
        stares at the bag like he didn't hear.

                                CHEW
                  Well, when do you get paid?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Soon as I finish the job.

                                CHEW
                  When might that be?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Day after tomorrow.

                                CHEW
                  Oh!  Day after tomorrow.

        Sebastian nods.  Chew stares at the poor bastard, con-
        cerned in spite of himself.

                                CHEW
                  The rich hate to pay, Sebastian.
                  A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting.
                  Pay the little guy last.  You should
                  charge twice as much.  It'll make
                  him feel better.

        Sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll
        do.  Chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thanks, Mr. Chew.

        Chew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes
        through quick as a dog.

        EXT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S STORE - STREET - NIGHT             24

        Sebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he
        came for and there's a hopeful spring to his walk as
        he heads for his truck.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S AMBULANCE - NIGHT                      25

        It's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights.
        The lettering on the side reads "J.R. SEBASTIAN -
        ANIMOID EXPRESS."  Sebastian gets in, starts up the
        engine and suddenly realizes he's not alone.  It's a
        jolt that causes him to yelp.

        PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up
        with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for
        a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-
        ing.

        But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.
        Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her
        and opens the door.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hey!  You forgot your...

        He holds up the bag.  Hesitantly she reaches for it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How come you were in my truck?

                                PRIS
                  I was tired and didn't have any
                  place to go.

        She stares at him, hand on her case, looking lost.
        Sebastian isn't good at this, but he tries.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You can get back in if you want...

        She can't make up her mind.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

        She gets in.  Both of them are silent.  People are not
        Sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this
        girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age --
        it gives him courage.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What's your name?

                                PRIS
                  Pris.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

                                PRIS
                  Hi.

        So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
        while what comes next.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!  Where do you want to go?

        She shrugs.  That leaves him a lot of responsibility.
        He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You want to go home?

                                PRIS
                  I don't have one.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh.

        What do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like
        she's lost out of some "Welcome to Sunny Arizona"
        poster?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Where are your folks?

                                PRIS
                  They left.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What about friends?

                                PRIS
                  I have some, but I have to find
                  out where they are staying.

        She leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash.
        Her body would win prizes, from any angle.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, where should I take you?

        She looks at him,a shadow of enticement in her clear
        blue eyes.

                                PRIS
                  We scared each other pretty good
                  didn't we?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  We sure did.

        She giggles and laughs.

                                PRIS
                  I'm hungry, J.F.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I've got stuff.  If you wanna go
                  to my place?

                                PRIS
                  I was hoping you'd say that.

        Sebastian's face is normally on the grey side, but it
        just turned red.  He turns on the ignition and they
        pull away from the curb.

        INT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    26

        Speeding along the freeway.  The terminal in the com-
        munications console lit.  Deckard's right hand just
        finished a punch-up.  The screen flashes back.

        REQUEST

        Deckard punches up.  Letters flash across the screen:

        ESPER

        Screen flashes back:

        CLEARANCE

        Deckard punches up.

        BLADE RUNNER ONE CODE ML-33

        Pause.

        Screen flashes:

        STAND BY.

        Deckard's voice has been heard over the preceding.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Machines can be helpful sometimes,
                  but they can also be a pain in the
                  ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger
                  and you might wind up at a steel-
                  mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once
                  in a while -- it's their personalities
                  that usually get me.  Somebody once
                  said that man makes machines in his own
                  image.  If that's true, whoever made
                  Esper should have been shot.

                                ESPER
                  This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go
                  ahead please.

        Esper's deep melodious voice is anxious to please, and
        oiled with a touch of self-pity.

                                DECKARD
                  You equipped for random questions?

                                ESPER
                  Why, yes, of course.

                                DECKARD
                  You start.

                                ESPER
                  The five in question are third
                  generation Nexus Sixes, constructed
                  of skin-flesh culture, selected

                  program.  Are you with me?

                                DECKARD
                  How do I stop one?

                                ESPER
                  Unlike a five, they can sustain
                  massive traumas to several parts
                  of the body without debilitating
                  another.  Sever a leg and it will
                  perform quicker on the remaining leg
                  than the fastest man can run,

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, but...

                                ESPER
                  I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable
                  zone is the base of the skull,
                  the occipital bone.  A direct hit
                  is a positive retirement.

        The communication is interrupted by a BELL which is
        immediately followed by a stern, MECHANICAL VOICE.

                                VOICE

        In his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad
        motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds
        of hell.  They draw silently alongside.  Deckard
        presses his I.D. to the window.

        The cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his
        partner accelerate, vanish in the night.  And Deckard's
        car does too.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT                              27

        A district of silence and ruin.  The street is strewn
        with refuse.  The building looks vacant.  A ten storey
        condo gone to shit.  The vandals have come and gone
        long ago.

        Sebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb.
        MR. DEETCHUM, the old Watchman, sitting in the building
        entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic
        book.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      28

        Well stocked with items of survival, all labeled and
        stacked.  And shelved along the walls and hung from the
        ceiling is a menagerie of animoids.  Like so many broken
        toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastian's wise hands.
        
        Sebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a
        stereo scope.  The tool in his right hand is a sensor
        probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en-
        graver.

        The object of his concentration is a maze-like chip
        configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified
        under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a
        large city.  The needle-like sensor probe moves care-
        fully over the contours of the configuration, testing
        the bonds.

        Suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!

        Pris is light on her feet.  She's standing behind him
        with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand.

                                PRIS
                  Whatcha doin'?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You scared me.

        But he's happy to see her.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'm working.

        She's changed her dress and made up her face.  Looks a
        little older and sexier.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You look... better.

                                PRIS
                  Just better.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Beautiful.

                                PRIS
                  Thanks.

        He watches her as she prowls around the room, looking
        at this and that, eating her sandwich.

                                PRIS
                  And you live in this building all
                  by yourself?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yeah, I live here pretty much
                  alone right now...

        Trying to make light of it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No housing shortage around here...
                  plenty of room for everybody.

        She sprawls on the couch studying him.

                                PRIS
                  How old are you?

        He can't meet her eyes.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Twenty.

                                PRIS
                  What's your problem?

        It's not an easy subject.  His voice is barely audible.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Methuselah Syndrome.

                                PRIS
                  What's that?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  My glands.  They grow old too fast.

                                PRIS
                  Is that why you're still here?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

        There is a silence.  He steals a glance at her.

                                PRIS
                  I like you just the way you are.

        Under the desk he bats his knees together.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Ah, you get hold of your friends?

                                PRIS
                  As a matter of fact I did.  They've
                  got some work to do tonight, but
                  they're gonna come tomorrow.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Good.

        The implications catch up.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I can sleep on the couch.

        A little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs
        up.

                                MOUSE
                  Don't let the bed bugs bite!

        Taking their cue from the mouse, some of the more
        talented animoids toot, flap and wheel about.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        29

        It's dark except for the glow of the terminal.  A tired
        Deckard sits in front of it.  Esper sounds like he's
        been talking for hours.

        A long pause.

                                ESPER
                  Here's something you might find
                  interesting.  They have been built
                  to emulate the human in every way
                  except in its emotional spectrum.
                  However, after a period of time
                  it is only logical that such a
                  'mechanism' would create its own
                  emotional responses, hate, love,
                  fear, anger, envy.

                                DECKARD
                  I know all that.

                                ESPER
                  What about a summary then.

                                DECKARD
                  I think we're through for the night.

        Deckard starts to reach for the panel.

                                ESPER
                  Mr. Deckard.

        Hesitates.

                                DECKARD
                  Yes?

                                ESPER
                  Do you have something against
                  science?

                                DECKARD
                  Not if it works.

                                ESPER
                  And what in your estimation works?

                                DECKARD
                  The umbrella.

        Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the
        terminal off button before Esper can respond and the
        machine goes dead.  He sits there for a moment then
        flips on the lamp.  Leon's snap-shots are spread out
        before him.

        INT. SPINNER - DAY                                      30

        A police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into
        a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Every government that could was
                  racing to populate their colonial
                  territory.  But emigrants needed
                  incentive.  Over-population and
                  the greenhouse factor didn't seem
                  to be enough; but owning a human
                  look-a-like had lots of appeal.
                  It was big industry, the competition
                  was stiff and Tyrell was top of the
                  line.

        EXT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           31

        The spinner gently touches down.  The hatch drops open
        and Deckard steps out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  His claim to fame was making a
                  product more human than human and
                  sometimes the 'more' turned out to
                  be a problem.  This wasn't just an
                  escaped andy who broke his owner's
                  arm -- there were twenty-eight
                  people dead and the pressure was
                  on.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           32

        Deckard walks up to a desk, hands his I.D. to a guard
        who checks it against a list on a screen.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But so far they'd always managed
                  to keep it quiet.  Not to say
                  that once in a while there wasn't
                  bad publicity.  Some fanatic
                  bitching about equal rights for
                  andies or an occasional trade union
                  proclaiming it was aun-American for
                  automatons to take jobs away from
                  humans on the colony.

        The guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button
        and Deckard walks away.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But what's more American than good
                  old supply and demand?  The
                  Government needed them, industry
                  made them and the church backed
                  them.  The big religious boys
                  said that Androids, no matter how
                  human, were objects; only God
                  could make people. I'm not religious,
                  but I was inclined to agree.
                  Otherwise I'd be out of a job.

        The elevator door slides open.  The young lady inside
        would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in
        the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting.

                                RACHAEL
                  Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is
                  Rachael.

        Deckard tips his head to her and steps in.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY                  33

        No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes
        closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi-
        ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty
        is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION CORRIDOR - DAY                  33A

        The door slides open and they continue down the corri-
        dor.

                                 RACHAEL
                  It seems your department doesn't
                  believe out new unit is to the
                  public benefit.

                                 DECKARD
                  A humanoid robot is like any other
                  machine, it can be a benefit or a
                  hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's
                  not our problem.

                                 RACHAEL
                  But because your department can't
                  do an adequate job in detecting
                  the miniscule number at large,
                  it's a problem.  Correct, Mr.
                  Deckard?

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - AIR-FILTERED CORRIDOR - DAY   33B

        They pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor.
        Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking
        at the animals.  Small northern animals in neat "en-
        vironmental" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon
        and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops
        him.  The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
        off them.

                                RACHAEL
                  You like our owl?

        Deckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens
        its yellow eyes and blinks at them.

                                DECKARD
                  It's artificial?

                                RACHAEL
                  Of course not.

        Hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards
        the exit without looking back.

        The exit is another tube.  Just big enough for two.  No
        room for excess.  He tries to ignore her cool appraising
        stare.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're in a very unique position,
                  Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the
                  future of this entire organization
                  according to how you work your
                  little test.

        Deckard has nothing to say.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you apprehensive?

                                DECKARD
                  Why should I be?

                                RACHAEL
                  For the responsibility of your
                  power.  Being a police bureaucrat,
                  you've got more than your share.

        The door slides open.  Deckard looks down at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You got it wrong, girl.  I work
                  with the bureau not for them.

        He lets it sink in.

                                DECKARD
                  My job isn't to detect
                  malfunctioning andies, it's to
                  eliminate them.  The more the
                  better.

        He walks out of the elevator first.

        INT. INNER SANCTUM OF DR. TYRELL - DAY                  34

        The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience
        reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like
        glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  Dr. Tyrell is a
        fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained
        from steroids and surgery.  Dapper and trim, he leans
        against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket
        watch.  The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE
        BREWING in the background.

        Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of
        Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule
        and face another door, this one befitting the decor of
        the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
        they enter.

                                RACHAEL
                  Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please
                  sit down.  Would you care for a cup
                  of coffee?

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

                                TYRELL
                  Black?

                                DECKARD
                  Please.

        Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
        cups and hands one to Deckard.  The congenial light in
        his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth.

                                TYRELL
                  Somehow, I didn't expect that the
                  man who did the dirty work would
                  be the man to do the technical
                  work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard.

        He hands Deckard a cup of coffee.

                                TYRELL
                  Is this to be an empathy test?

                                DECKARD
                  Yes.

                                TYRELL
                  Capillary dilation of the so-called
                  blush response?  Plus fluctuation
                  of the pupil, plus involuntary
                  dilation of the iris?

        Deckard nods.

                                TYRELL
                  May I ask a personal question?

                                DECKARD
                  Go ahead.

                                TYRELL
                  Have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake?

                                DECKARD
                  No.

                                TYRELL
                  But in your profession that is a
                  risk.

                                DECKARD
                  Nothing is infallible, but so far
                  the Voight-Kampff scale bas been
                  foolproof.

                                TYRELL
                  Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a
                  machine can be a hazard.  The
                  Voight-Kampff scale is a machine,
                  isn't it?

                                DECKARD
                  One that relies on human
                  interpretation.  Where's the
                  subject?

                                TYRELL
                  Sitting next to you.

        Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell.  Delighted,
        Tyrell takes a cup of coffee.

        Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and
        starts fishing out the apparatus.

        THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF                                       35

        Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot
        with light, the pupil contracting.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Ready.

                                RACHAEL
                  Go ahead.

        In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both
        gauges are at rest.  Dr. Tyrell stands silhouetted behind
        Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam
        trained on her eye.  Wire mesh discs are attached to her
        cheeks.

                                DECKARD
                  You're given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday.

        The needles in both gauges swing violently past green to
        red, then subside.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd
                  report the person who gave it to
                  me to the police.

                                DECKARD
                  You have a little boy.  He shows
                  you his butterfly collection, plus
                  the killing jar.

        Again the gauges register, but not so far.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd take him to the doctor.

                                DECKARD
                  You're watching T.V. and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on your
                  wrist.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd kill it.

        Both needles go to red.  Deckard makes a note, takes a
        sip of coffee and continues.

                                DECKARD
                  In a magazine you come across a
                  full-page photo of a nude girl.

                                RACHAEL
                  Is this testing whether I'm an
                  android or a lesbian?

                                DECKARD
                  You show the picture to your husband.
                  He likes it and hangs it on the wall.
                  The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

                                RACHEL
                  I wouldn't let him.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  I should be enough for him.

        Deckard frowns, then smiles.  His smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around.

                                DECKARD
                  You become pregnant by a man who
                  runs off with your best friend,
                  and you decide to get an abortion.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd never get an abortion.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  In your opinion.

                                RACHAEL
                  It would be my child.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like you speaks from
                  experience.

        He notes the needles.  One goes green and the other
        remains inert.

                                DECKARD
                  Last question.  You're watching
                  an old movie.  It shows a banquet in
                  progress, the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters.

                                RACHAEL
                  Ugh.

        Both needles swing swiftly.

                                DECKARD
                  The entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice.

        Needles move less.

                                DECKARD
                  The raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog.

        Deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
        switches off his beam.

                                DECKARD
                  Lights please.

        The lights come on.

                                TYRELL
                  Well?

                                DECKARD
                  If she is, the machine works.

                                TYRELL
                  The machine works.  She is.

        Rachael sits very still.  Except her eyes -- they go to
        Tyrell and hang on.  He stares back at her as he speaks.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions did it take?

                                DECKARD
                  Thirteen.

        Rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles
        around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell.
        His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  She's hang-
        ing by a thread.

        Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.

                                DECKARD
                  She didn't know?

                                TYRELL
                  Memory implant.  She was programmed.
                  But I think she has transcended
                  her conditioning.  I think she was
                  beginning to suspect.

        Rachael nods fixedly.  Careful not to let go her grasp.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions does it usually
                  take, Mr. Deckard?

                                DECKARD
                  Five, maybe six.

        Slowly, carefully, Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael
        and turns towards Deckard, who is starting to put away
        his equipment.

                                TYRELL
                  You're going to have to be on your
                  toes, my friend.

        Deckard glances back at him.

                                TYRELL
                  It's a complex problem and we
                  wouldn't want anything to happen
                  to you.

        Less of a man might shrink at the end of Deckard's look,
        but not Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  For the good of all, I recommend
                  you take Rachael with you.
                  Considering her uniqueness, I'm
                  sure she could prove quite helpful.

        Deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of Tyrell's
        style.  He turns away and starts packing up the Voight-
        Kampff.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

        Deckard is ready to go.

                                TYRELL
                  And how is it one man will be able
                  to cover so much ground?

                                DECKARD
                  Discreetly.

                                TYRELL
                  All pertinent information is
                  being fed into your departmental
                  computer, an Esper 231 -- I
                  believe -- and a photo over-lay
                  packet is being produced.

        Deckard opens the door.

                                TYRELL
                  Mr. Deckard, I think it would be
                  wise to reconsider my offer.

        Rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her
        feet flat on the floor, alone is the word.

        Trying to keep the fury out of it, Deckard's voice
        comes out in a whisper.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        On the last word, Rachael glances up at him and Deckard
        turns away. The outer door slides open and he goes
        through it.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     36

        As seen through the windshield from the passenger side
        of a vintage Dusenberg.  The headlights cut through the
        dark, illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road.  A
        downgrade.

        A sign slides by stating:  "Caution Curves Ahead."
        Good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop
        to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left.

        The steady HUM of the ENGINE and the HISS of the TIRES
        will remain, but the location suddenly changes to:

        INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                       37

        A pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm.  The
        young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug.
        Her back to the viewer.  As she bends over to vacuum
        beneath the couch, exposing her beautiful ass, an
        admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired MALE
        VOICE intercedes.

                                VOICE
                  Let's keep our eyes on the road,
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Sorry.

        Abruptly the VIEW FLASHES BACK TO:

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     38

        The moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing
        over the hood of the car.  The road is getting steeper
        and the corners sharper.  Rags of mist skim by as the
        Dusenberg picks up speed.  It is becoming a riveting
        ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        39

        Swift, soft clouds overhead.  In the cold shine of
        the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples
        and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the
        frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue-white snow,
        melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich
        brown earth.

                                VOICE
                  Come on, stay with the machine.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     40

        The Dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating
        up the road.  Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four-
        wheel drifts.  Not a pleasant sensation if you don't
        like roller-coasters.

        The Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
        hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend.

        Good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into
        high and screws on.

        EXT. LAKE - DAY                                         41

        Cold and gray.  The current running strong.  The nose
        of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling
        for the shore.

        This is cold remote country, wild and untouched.  A sky
        bluer than the Madonna's cloak.  The kayak banks and
        the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach
        towards a little camp.

                                VOICE
                  We're going to have to start the
                  sequence again if you don't stay
                  with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  How do you know I'm not?

                                VOICE
                  You're not responding to the
                  stimulus.  I can see right here,
                  I'm not getting a reading.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  I'm tired of this.

                                VOICE
                  Almost through.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     42

        In the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen-
        ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by
        the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled.  And the
        passenger's view snaps back to the road.

        Suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach-
        ing bend.  Large ones, of a bus or a truck.  Blinding.

        The Dusenberg is going too fast to stop.  No room to
        pass.  HORNS BLAST.  The Dusenberg brakes, goes into a
        broadside skid.  The hands of the passenger reach out
        and grip the mahogany dash.  Brakes locked, TIRES
        SCREAMING, skidding.  The Dusenberg tears through the
        railing and plunges into space.  The last view of the
        passenger is pure vertigo.  Silence.

        INT. DOCTOR WHEELER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                43

        The good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which
        resembles a pin-ball machine.  Displayed under its
        surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
        read-outs indicating the results of the test.

        Deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which
        it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no
        worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to
        the doctor's desk.

                                DECKARD
                  So how did I do?

        Dr. Wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise
        of compassion in his sunken eyes.

                                WHEELER
                  Nerves of steel.

                                DECKARD
                  No rust?

                                WHEELER
                  I didn't say that.  Your motivity
                  rate checked out a little slower
                  than last time.

                                DECKARD
                  Meaning?

                                WHEELER
                  Meaning you don't run as fast as
                  you used to.

        Deckard starts to dress.

                                WHEELER
                  During the road test...

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah?

                                WHEELER
                  Your mind kept wandering.  That
                  bothered me.

                                DECKARD
                  Huh huh.

                                WHEELER
                  Considering the nature of your
                  work, that could be unhealthy.

                                DECKARD
                  True.

        Wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger
        comes down on the section illuminating Deckard's simple
        statistics.

                                WHEELER
                  You got a birthday coming up.

        Deckard bends over slipping on his shoes.  Wheeler looks
        up, concerned.

                                WHEELER
                  But you haven't put in for
                  emigration.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.

                                WHEELER
                  You're going to be over the limit.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, I could make you a long
                  list of complaints about this
                  fucken city but I still rather be
                  here than up there.

                                WHEELER
                  What if you change your mind?

                                DECKARD
                  They'll change the limit before
                  I change my mind.

                                WHEELER
                  You sure?

                                DECKARD
                  Never been more sure of anything
                  in my life.

        Deckard is ready to go.  Looking at Wheeler, a little
        touched with his concern.

                                DECKARD
                  Why didn't you go?

                                WHEELER
                  Too old.

                                DECKARD
                  But if you could?

        Wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head.

                                WHEELER
                  My job is here.

                                DECKARD
                  Me too.

        They shake hands and Deckard walks.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON             44

        The referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep
        up with the two Mexican light-weights pounding the shit
        out of each other.  If not for the fuzz and the silence,
        the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think
        you were ringside at the Garden.  It's a good fight but
        Pris isn't watching.

        She's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
        nails.  The room is so quiet you can almost hear the
        polish.  She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE
        form above STOPS HER

        It sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR, but so quiet,
        sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  She
        stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at
        Sebastian.

        On the other side of the room, in his own world,
        Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering
        gossamer strands with a laser.

        Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
        quietly behind her.  If the animoids nestled around
        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd
        be the only ones in the room who did.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-     45
        NOON

        Pris moving smoothly past the doors, some of them open
        and warped offering sights and shadow and decay.

        INT. FIRE STAIRS - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-  46
        NOON

        The gloom in here is like the light of the empty well.
        Her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the
        hollow silence.

        INT. THE FLOOR ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       47
        AFTERNOON

        She's running now, down the hall, stops at the apart-
        ment directly above Sebastian's and opens the door.

        INT. APARTMENT ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       48
        AFTERNOON

        Mary turns her head as Pris comes in.  She's sitting in
        a chair.  The only piece of furniture in the room.
        It's broken and tilts at a funny angle.  She nods and
        Pris nods back.

        Batty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly
        from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck.

                                BATTY
                  What's going on down there?

                                PRIS
                  He's not ready yet.

                                BATTY
                  When?

                                PRIS
                  Tomorrow, he says.

        Batty nods he can't wait.  Pris glances at Mary and
        gives a frigid little smile.  Pris backs out and closes
        the door behind her.  Batty blows air through his
        nostrils.  Like an animal.

        EXT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    49

        The sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk.
        Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckard's car
        as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off-
        ramp curve.

        EXT./INT. CAR - STREETS - NIGHT                         50

        Moving through the dark city streets.  Deckard turns a
        corner and guns it up a long, steep hill.

        EXT. STREET - DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               51

        At the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and
        disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise.

        INT. CORRIDOR DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               52

        He's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped
        plastic plate and stops in front of his door.  It's
        riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of
        his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock,
        the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door
        shut behind him.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        53

        He slips on the light and crosses the front room.
        Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved
        in or is just moving out.

        As he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND
        him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out
        in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got
        shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but
        direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then
        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
        floor.

                                RACHAEL
                  Was that your dinner?

        Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.  I called and found out
                  you were on your way home.  These
                  were already delivered to your
                  department but I thought you
                  should have copies as soon as
                  possible.

        She's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
        pack.  But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to
        recede.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's the Nexus information you
                  wanted.

        He takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks
        must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily.
        He doesn't even want to ask.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        He realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and
        sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring
        at each other.  The situation makes awkward silence.
        At least for him.  She's looking at him like she's
        got something to say but isn't saying it.

                                DECKARD
                  Is there anything else?

                                RACHAEL
                  I know you think it complicates
                  your work, but I'm here to help.

                                DECKARD
                  I've already got more help than
                  I need.

                                RACHAEL
                  I think you need more help than
                  you've got.

        He doesn't, but she's not backing off.

                                RACHAEL
                  There's two reasons a man rejects
                  help.  Either because he's so good
                  at what he does he doesn't think
                  he needs it, or he's so insecure
                  he can't admit it.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either
                  way, but the answer is still no.

                                RACHAEL
                  Two of us might be more effective
                  than one.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        She smiles.

                                RACHAEL
                  No you don't.

        She lets it sink in.

                                RACHAEL
                  You use your equipment, don't you?

                                DECKARD
                  So?

                                RACHAEL
                  So, I'm a piece of equipment.
                  Use me.

        It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long
        one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do
        something about such an offer but...

        Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to
        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put-
        ting it back on the plate.

                                DECKARD
                  That's okay, I'll get it...

        He bends down to help, but she's already done it.
        Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes
        diminishes the distance even more.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do I make you nervous?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.

        And she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the
        plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor,
        almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her.
        She says it plain and simple.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's strange to suddenly realize
                  that what you thought was your
                  life is actually someone else's
                  fabrication.

        Deckard nods.  He feels it, but doesn't know what to
        do about it.

                                DECKARD
                  I can imagine.

                                RACHAEL
                  Can you?  I couldn't.

        These are not some of Deckard's finer moments.  But she
        doesn't seem to notice.

                                RACHAEL
                  A part of me is glad.  I think I
                  feel more.  I don't like who I was
                  before.

        Deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is
        glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen.

        In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks
        around for a place to put the plate, but things have
        piled up on him in here.  He contemplates the refrig-
        erator.

                                DECKARD
                  So why do you think they were
                  after their records.

        He's a lot more comfortable talking shop.

                                RACHAEL
                  They probably want to find out
                  when they were made.

                                DECKARD
                  Right.

        He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out.
        She's writing something on a card.

                                RACHAEL
                  I guess the date of your birth is
                  important if you know you're not
                  made to last.

        No way he can keep his foot out of it.  She looks up and
        hands him the card.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's my number.  If you need me.

        She goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before
        going through.

                                RACHAEL
                  You better get better locks --
                  if you want to keep me out.

        She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says
        she's talking about all kinds of locks.  Deckard looks
        like he might ask her to stay, but...

                                RACHAEL
                  Good night.

        And she's gone.

                                DECKARD
                  Night.

        He looks down at the number.  It's the back side of a
        snapshot.   He turns it over.  The picture of a man
        and a woman.  The little girl between them looks like
        a six-year old Rachael.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        54

        He's sitting in front of his console studying pictures
        of Nexus Sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless
        and unadorned on his monitor.

        The over-lay machine is transforming each image with
        instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors,
        age, youth, hats, glasses, etc.  All in rapid succession,
        running the gambit from ominous to beautiful.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The possibilities were infinite.
                  They could change their appearances
                  but not their future.
                  Like she said, it was short.
                  Longevity is what they were after.
                  The garbage man even wanted a past.
                  Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but
                  I knew she was right.  The market
                  worked on turn-over.  Built-in
                  obsolescence was the name of the
                  game.  That meant her too.  It
                  was something I didn't want to
                  think about.

        On top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with
        a spoon stuck in it.  Deckard puts out his cigarette
        and reaches for them as the PHONE RINGS.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  Bryant here.  Regarding the
                  rundown you requested on job
                  applicants, Esper's concluded that
                  the only irregular category that
                  Tyrell's got is the entertainment
                  section.  You better get on it.

                                DECKARD
                  I was just about to have my dinner.

                                BRYANT
                  If you hurry you'll get back
                  before it gets cold.  I got a
                  spinner on your roof in five
                  minutes.  Good luck.

        Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans.  He didn't
        want them anyway.  He gets up and walks to the bedroom.
        Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds
        his ankle laser and straps it on.

        EXT. CITY - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - NIGHT                     55

        The spinner skirts through the canyons of the city.
        Deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the
        maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks
        swing by below.  The tops of larger buildings shimmer
        with advertisements and weather announcements.

        INT. SPINNER - OVER CITY - NIGHT                        56

        Deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen-
        ing to Esper.

                                EPSER

                                DECKARD
                  What is a conventional term?

                                ESPER
                  Four years.  Which would make her
                  termination date...

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind.  Do they have that
                  knowledge?

                                ESPER
                  Longevity is classified.  No.

        Back to business.

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, gimme a run-down on the
                  three females.

        EXT./INT. SPINNER - LANDING AREA - NIGHT                57

        Deckard taking it down.  About to pull it in an already
        crowded lot, but the sign flashes "FULL."  Deckard
        doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any-
        way when a Chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and
        waves him off.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck.

        Pissed, Deckard veers away and buzzes low over and
        around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a
        lot of room around here.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      58

        Finally brings it down between two buildings hardly
        enough clearance, but he jockeys the machine into an
        alley, touches down and runs it slowly along the surface
        -- parking it by a sign that says "NO PARKING."

        EXT. STREET - TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                      59

        Not many people.  Wind blowing.  A nest of garish
        small-time clubs.

        Deckard emerges from one, goes into the next.  The
        pulsing neon over the entry says "TAFFEY'S BAR."

        INT. TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                               60

        Crowded in here.  BONGO MUSIC.  Deckard is at the bar
        sitting next to a big-bellied man in a black beard who's
        looking through a viewer.  On the small stage in the
        background AMAZING RAMA is eating razor blades, a part
        of her juggling routine.

        Deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a
        door at the rear.

        INT. TAFFEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                            61

        Taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "Chicken
        Hawk" collector of young girls.

        It must be so, there's one in the bed.  Thin, pale,
        about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her
        fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead,
        lying flat on her back in Taffey's crowded little
        room.

        Taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow
        shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like
        a seal.  But at the moment he's not present.

        There's a KNOCK at the DOOR, then the SOUND of a TOILET
        FLUSHING.  Taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart
        pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches
        the door like the guilty fucker he is.  He looks through
        the peeper.

        Deckard is out there holding up his I.D.

                                DECKARD
                  Taffey Lewis?

                                TAFFEY
                  Yes?

                                DECKARD
                  Can I come in?

        There is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not
        to think of a way to say no.  The door opens and Deckard
        enters.  Except for the drool coming out of the corner of
        her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, Venus doesn't
        move a muscle.

                                TAFFEY
                  Excuse my niece there... She's
                  studying for an exam.

        Deckard takes the  Identikit hard copies our of his
        pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them
        out on the table.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like  you to take a look at
                  these pictures.

                                TAFFEY
                  Of course.

        Taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures
        from about two inches away.

                                TAFFEY
                  You see I lost my contacts a
                  couple of days ago around here
                  somewhere and my sight is a
                  little... What am I supposed
                  to be looking for?

                                DECKARD
                  Do you recognize any of
                  them?

        He stops at Zhora.

                                TAFFEY
                  This one looks familiar, but
                  I don't know.  Naw.  There's
                  one came in today looks a
                  little like this one but...

                                DECKARD
                  What did she want?

                                TAFFEY
                  Who?

                                DECKARD
                  The girl that doesn't look
                  like that girl.

                                TAFFEY
                  Nothing.  She wanted to know
                  about suck night.

                                DECKARD
                  What night?

                                TAFFEY
                  I didn't know if I wanted to
                  handle her -- I already got
                  a snake act.  But my partner
                  goes down there to the Opera
                  House on suck night to book
                  the good ones.

                                DECKARD
                  What's suck night?

                                TAFFEY
                  That's what we call in the
                  trade, audition free-for-
                  alls and most of it sucks.
                  Bit I don't think that's
                  her.

                                DECKARD
                  You talking about the Opera
                  House on the Main?

        Taffey nods.  Deckard goes to the door and turns.

                                DECKARD
                  Book the good ones for where?

                                TAFFEY
                  Lots of places.  The tours,
                  the clubs, the Silicone shows,
                  private parties.

                                DECKARD
                  What shows?

                                TAFFEY
                  Silicone Valley.  Lots of
                  these science guys never
                  leave that place.  We book
                  two shows a month in there.
                  Those big time techs and bio-
                  guys might be real high zoners
                  up here, but when it comes
                  to the arts, they like it loud
                  and lewd.

        It's starting to get a little gooey.  Deckard tips his
        head good night and backs out of the door.

        INT. THE OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                        62

        Onstage four Mexican acrobats, in matching metallic
        jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of
        a human wheel.  From the P.A. system the Announcer's
        voice blares through the cavernous theatre.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Let's hear it for the Hermano
                  Brothers.

        Scattered APPLAUSE.  Hand in hand, the Hermano Brothers
        bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Next we're gonna see a little
                  charmer who keeps her dancing
                  partner in a basket!  She
                  comes to us all the way from
                  exotic Casablanca.  'Salome.'

        The old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version
        of "In a Persian Market" as SALOME dances onstage.
        She's a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer
        costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in
        the right places.  She kneels ceremoniously center
        stage and sets the basket down before her.  Carefully
        removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four-
        foot harlequin-patterned python.  Grinding her hips
        to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out
        like an offering.  Sounds of approval from the audience.
        The gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer,
        as she weaves sensuously around the floor.

        INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                  63

        To scattered APPLAUSE, HOOTS and WHISTLES, Salome
        flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul-
        ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the
        narrow corridor to her dressing room.  She's about
        to enter when:

                                DECKARD
                  Excuse me, Miss Salome.

        She turns.  Deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum-
        ble, sleazy persistence.  He comes closer with his
        shit-eating grin.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like to have a word with you
                  if I could.

        Salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels
        -- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion
        of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                SALOME
                  Yeah?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm with the American Federation
                  of Variety Artists...

        He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't worry, I'm not here to make
                  you join -- that's not my department.

        He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm an investigator for the
                  Confidential Committee on Moral
                  Abuses.

        She nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                DECKARD
                  There's been reports of management
                  sexually abusing the artists in
                  this place.

                                SALOME
                  I don't know nothing about it.

                                DECKARD
                  You haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in any
                  way?

        She's definitely puzzled.

                                SALOME
                  How do you mean 'exploited'?

                                DECKARD
                  Like to get this position.  Did
                  you or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                SALOME
                  Are you for real?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh, yeah.
                  You'd be surprised what goes on
                  around here.  I'd like to check
                  the dressing room if I could.

                                SALOME
                  What the fuck for?

                                DECKARD
                  For holes.

        This guy might be an asshole but he's funny.

                                SALOME
                  I don't believe this.

        She shrugs and they go in.

        INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                              64

        Musty and cramped.  A portable shower, a dressing table
        and not much else.  Salome takes the snake from around
        her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table.  Deck-
        ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights.

                                DECKARD
                  It that mother real?

                                SALOME
                  Of course he's not real.  You think
                  I'd be working here if I could
                  afford a real snake?

                                DECKARD
                  It's a good job.

                                SALOME
                  You mean the snake.

        Deckard nods.  There's not much costume to take off but
        she's doing it.

                                SALOME
                  The best.

                                DECKARD
                  Does it eat?

                                SALOME
                  Come on.

        His hand reaches out to touch it.  As his fingers make
        contact there's an electric "snap."  He jerks his hand
        back from the shock.

                                SALOME
                  Jeezus!

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                SALOME
                  Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck
                  mine, huh?

        She slides behind the screen and turns on the shower.
        Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room
        like he's inspecting the walls.

                                DECKARD
                  They have their ways of doing
                  their dirty work without the
                  victim knowing what's going on.

        His eyes are moving over everything she's got.

                                DECKARD
                  You'd be surprised what a guy'll
                  go through to get a glimpse of a
                  beautiful body.

                                SALOME
                  I bet I would.

                                DECKARD
                  Little dirty holes the bastards
                  drill in the wall so they can
                  watch a lady undress.

        And to his amazement he actually spots one.  It's down
        low on the wall.  Not a good idea to turn his back on
        work but he can't resist.

                                SALOME
                  And what if somebody did try to
                  'exploit' me?  Who do I go to?

        Through the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat
        legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Me.

                                SALOME
                  And who do I go to about you?

        He looks back.  She's some out of the shower dripping
        nude.  She's taken off her black wig.  Her hair is
        short and blonde.

        Deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit.
        He stares at her a moment too long.

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmmmm?

        Deckard grins and she returns it.

        She takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
        body.  The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue
        flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  Absently,
        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.

                                ZHORA
                  You ever get the feeling things
                  aren't the way they seem?

        Her hand closes around the snake's head.  Deckard sees
        it coming but can't move fast enough.  She strikes him
        so hard it knocks him off his feet.  Before he hits the
        floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  The snake whistles
        through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way.
        It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor.
        He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.

        INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                 65

        Deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through
        a door at the other end of the hall.  He sprints after
        her, arrives at the door and flings it open.  Black-
        ness.  The SOUND of her high heels CLATTER down the
        metal steps.

        EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                       66

        It's raining heavily.

        The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-
        fic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,
        hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur-
        ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly
        lit stands.   Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of
        place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to
        run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can.
        Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping,
        trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
        shelter.

        She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.

        Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
        ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped-
        estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them
        and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop or you're dead!

        She doesn't.  The beam flashes through the air, but
        she's already around the corner.

        With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move
        so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps
        in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a
        stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be-
        hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast.

        The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
        him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-
        tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and
        jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas-
        senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
        face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
        plasters her against the door.

        Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the
        street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast.
        Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands
        over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before
        she dies.

        Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
        over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it.

        Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street,
        trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's
        running fast, but the car is faster.

        As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids
        broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he
        rolls out FIRING.

        Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except...

        The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes
        through.

        It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front-
        ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made
        and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
        Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
        sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's
        laser.  But she doesn't.

        His last shot burns a hole through the base of her
        skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed
        takes what's left of her through the last two windows
        and into the street where she runs into a parked car
        with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
        it.

        Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for-
        ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something
        for everybody and they're coming from all directions.

        Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look.

        It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome
        and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast
        of metal and flesh.

        Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted.  So much commo-
        tion he doesn't notice THREE COPS closing in from
        behind.

                                COP
                  Drop it!

        Deckard has his back to them.  They're fanned out and
        crouched, ready to fire.  Deckard drops his laser.  Two
        of them rush up, spin him around while the third does a
        frisk.

        TWO MORE COPS arrive, wary and wild-eyed, pushing the
        people back -- his is not a good place for cops.

        Deckard's ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking
        him.  With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to
        the SERGEANT covering the action.

                                SERGEANT
                  On your belly!

        Deckard's not in the mood for it.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, Sergeant...

        He's reaching for his ID.  The Cop with the rubber
        billy hits him in the head.

        One thrill after another.  Somebody in the crowd YEOWLS.
        The last thing Deckard hears as he falls.  The Cop
        reaches inside Deckard's coat for the concealed weapon
        they missed, but it's an ID card.  He looks at it for a
        moment, then looks up.

                                COP
                  Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop.

        An embarrassing situation.

                                SERGEANT
                  Clear this fuckin' crowd.

        The Cops start pushing.  And for one split second one
        of the crowd looks a lot like Leon.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT               67

        Your standard low class crapper.  Bryant is planted
        firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
        rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his
        anger.  This is a public place, he doesn't want to
        yell.

                                BRYANT
                  Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't
                  change procedure.  A little known
                  fact can become a well-known fact
                  and part of our job, Deckard, is
                  to make sure that doesn't happen.
                  Now how can be do that if you blow
                  one away in front of a fuckin'
                  audience.

        It's not the sort of question that expects an answer.
        Deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll
        all go away.

                                BRYANT
                  Well?

        Deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel.
        Bryant slaps one in his hand.

                                DECKARD
                  She was gonna get away.

                                BRYANT
                  Then let her get away.  I thought
                  you were a pro -- you're supposed
                  to be a fuckin' tracker!

        Bryant takes a couple of deep breaths.

                                BRYANT
                  I'd say you got a little carried
                  away.

        Deckard's voice is barely audible.

                                DECKARD
                  I didn't like her.

                                BRYANT
                  You didn't like her!?

        He slams the handle on one of the urinals.

                                BRYANT
                  You start liking or disliking
                  andies it's time to hang it up.

        The PLUMPING ROARS and SUCKS and DIES.  There's nothing
        to do but nod.  Deckard nods.  Poor bastard has had a
        rough night.  Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
        hands it to him.  Deckard puts it to his mouth and
        Bryant watches Deckard's Adam's apple like he's count-
        ing the swallows.  Deckard hands it back empty.  Bryant
        caps it, puts it back in his pocket.

                                BRYANT
                  Look, go home.  Get some rest.
                  Take an aspirin.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

        Bryant shuffles out like an old bear.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - BAR - NIGHT                      68

        Cheap whiskey and bad wine.  That's the kind of place
        this is.  It's near closing.  But still a few at the
        bar.  Alcoholic silhouettes.

        In the b.g. Deckard comes down the passage from the
        men's room and stops at the phone.  He gets a number
        out of his pocket and calls it.  As he talks he leans
        against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy.

        Not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
        and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
        himself.

        Deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a
        stool.  The BARTENDER's a big lady with tits like sand
        bags and a voice that plays no favorites.

                                BARTENDER
                  I can't protect your drinks,
                  mister; while you was in the
                  potty, this hummer snatched it.

        Deckard glances at his stool-mate.  A huge MAN, slumped
        over the bar like a beached whale.

                                DECKARD
                  No problem.  Gimme another.

        The whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly
        Russian accent.

                                RUSSIAN
                  Forgive me.  I thought was free
                  drink.  I will pay.

                                DECKARD
                  Forget it.

        But the big man's digging through his pockets.  Deck-
        ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head.
        It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in
        his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your
        heart.  But it's Leon.

                                LEON
                  I think I have no money.

                                DECKARD
                  It's okay.  Forget it.

                                LEON
                  But I would like to buy you drink.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll but you one.  What'll you
                  have?

                                LEON
                  Vodka!

                                DECKARD
                  Shot of vodka, please.

                                LEON
                  Thank you very much.

                                DECKARD
                  My pleasure.

        Deckard brings out his smokes.  Offers one.  Leon takes
        it and they light up.  The drinks come.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach-
        es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and
        slaps that down too.  It's done with such pride that
        Deckard has to look.

                                LEON
                  You want to see my friends?

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry, don't have the time.

                                LEON
                  No problem.

        Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.

                                DECKARD
                  Those cockroaches?

                                LEON
                  Ya.

        Deckard looks interested.  One of them starts to scamp-
        er away, but Leon walls off the next with his huge hand.

                                DECKARD
                  How long you had these guys?

                                LEON
                  Two months.  But this one is not
                  guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

        Leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches
        to hear.

                                LEON
                  Usually Blackie waits until Igor
                  is eating; then, when his back is
                  turned, he tries to take advantage
                  of Anna.

        Deckard nods, definitely interested.  He signals the
        bartender for another round.  The drinks arrive.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Their eyes meet at the bottom.

                                LEON
                  You never saw a cockroach make
                  love?

        Deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to.

        Leon smiles slyly.

                                LEON
                  We will try.

        Leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
        it on the bar.  They both lean down and watch intently.
        The drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches
        are not cooperating.

                                LEON
                  It must be that he is not hungry
                  or maybe she is not hot.

        Leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
        back in their box.  He holds up the last and kisses it.

                                LEON
                  You like to kiss her goodbye.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

                                BARTENDER
                  Make sure you take your girlfriends
                  with you when you leave.

        What neither of them notices is that between Leon's
        fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh.

        Deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.

                                LEON
                  I like you.

                                DECKARD
                  I like you too.

                                LEON
                  One more, eh?

                                DECKARD
                  I gotta piss.

        Deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in
        a stiff wind and stops.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'll piss outside.

        Leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
        the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit.

        EXT. ALLEY - OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                    69

        Deckard reels out.  The door swings shut and he's sober
        as hell and moving fast.  Around the big trash dumpster
        alongside the building, he plasters himself against the
        wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door.  He's in a
        good spot with a perfect line of fire.  Moments go by
        and he's glad for the time to steady himself.  The
        SOUND of his BREATHING, the HUM of the city and the
        quiet.

        Suddenly from behind, Deckard is swept off his feet and
        twirled around in Leon's bear-trap embrace.

        Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls
        out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon is so
        fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand.

        Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the wall.

                                LEON
                  How come you know where Zhora was
                  so quick?

        His hand is lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's
        hair.

                                DECKARD
                  I showed pictures.  Somebody
                  recognized her.  I went to see.

        Deckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run.

                                LEON
                  How old am I?

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.

        The grip tightens and twists.

                                LEON
                  My birthday is April 10, 2015.
                  How long do I live?

                                DECKARD
                  Four years.

        He lets go.

                                LEON
                  More than you.

        Deckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down
        faster, like a hammer.

                                LEON
                  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.

        Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.

                                LEON
                  But that's how it is to be a
                  slave.  The future is sealed off,
                  he grovels, he waits.

        Even hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun,
        but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley.

        Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
        scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot,
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.

                                LEON
                  Sex, reproduction, security, the
                  simple things.  But no way to
                  satisfy them.  To be homesick
                  with no place to go.  Potential
                  with no way to use it.  Lots of
                  little oversights in the Nexus 6.

        He slams Deckard into the wall.

                                LEON
                  I tell you, nothing is worse
                  than having an itch you can never
                  scratch.

        Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles,
        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next
        one.

        Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
        tion of smashing Deckard's skull.

        The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from
        satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his
        neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog.  Dead.

        Rachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there
        looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward
        and drops Deckard's gun by his side.

        Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
        up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her,
        panting, spits blood and almost smiles.

                                DECKARD
                  Like I said, I don't need your
                  help.

        After a long moment, she bends down to touch him.

                                RACHAEL
                  You look terrible, you know that?

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT             70

        He's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast,
        water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking
        just a little wicked in his balmy luxury.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I knew a cop once who was involved
                  in a high-speed chase.  They shot
                  out one of his tires and he went
                  over a cliff at hundred and fifty
                  miles an hour.  They found him in
                  the morning with a broken skull,
                  six fractured ribs and second-
                  degree burns.  On the way to the
                  hospital he made a play for the
                  nurse.

        He takes a drink and clears his throat.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey!  I thought you were supposed
                  to be taking care of me.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  What do you need?

        He doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink.
        Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll,
        and stands there looking down at him.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't just stand there looking at
                  me.  It's not polite.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do you want me to do?

                                DECKARD
                  Sit.

        She sits on the edge of the tub.

                                DECKARD
                  Gimme your arm.

        She's wearing a short-sleeved dress.  It's a long, del-
        icate arm and Deckard holds it, inspecting it like a
        maestro with a Stradivarius.  He looks up at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You ever take a bath with a man
                  before?

                                RACHAEL
                  There's a lot I haven't done with
                  a man before.

        He's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
        her arm.  Starting with her wrist and running the bar
        to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  She
        watches, not quite sure of the ritual.

        He pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould-
        ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under
        her arm into the privacy of her dress.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're getting me wet.

        Oh, yes.  For a moment Deckard stares at her like some
        furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other
        hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            71

        The bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard
        looks like something that was washed up in it.  He's
        spread out flat, face creased and puffed.

        His eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  His
        hands are more reliable.  They search over the bed,
        but find it bare.  He edges his head over the side,
        looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  He
        gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  Then
        sits again, resting his head in his hands.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING           72

        Deckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it.  It's
        been a long night.  Nothing a new tongue and a trans-
        fusion wouldn't put right.  He moves a couple of inches
        to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING        73

        Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on
        his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap
        and having no luck.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  Sorry, I am not in at the moment,
                  but if you'll leave your name and
                  number I'll return your call as
                  soon as I can.

        That's not soon enough.  Deckard hangs up, puts the
        phone on the floor and leans back on the couch.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck you, then.

        INT. MR. DEETCHUM'S APARTMENT - MORNING                 74

        The rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny
        wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at
        the ceiling.  Between crows there's a TAPPING at the
        door.

        You might call this a "barnyard" apartment.  There's
        straw on the floor and several hens roosting against
        the back wall.  The front door opens a few inches and
        Sebastian pokes his head in.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum?  Hello?

        Nobody seems to be home except his chickens.  As Sebas-
        tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose
        charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Now, now, Waddles.

        Seeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder, Waddles
        veers off from the attack.  As Sebastian crosses the
        room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hello, Wrigley.

        He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting
        them into a bowl he's brought.  He puts down the bowl
        and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the
        payment and puts the money on a plate.  He's about to
        leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very
                  good care of you people.

        Pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser
        with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets
        his bowel of eggs and leaves.

        Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for
        a long drink.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S FLOOR - MORNING             75

        Sebastian arrives on his floor, walks down the hall to
        his apartment, opens the door, walks in.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        76

        He turns to close door, comes face to face with Roy
        Batty.  Sebastian drops his bowl of eggs.  Batty's
        hand flashes out and catches it.

                                BATTY
                  Whoops.

        Smiling, Batty hands them back to Sebastian, who is
        too startled to speak.

        Pris runs up and gives Batty and Mary a big hug, steps
        back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen-
        ager.

                                PRIS
                  This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

                                BATTY
                  Hello, glad to meet you.

        He pumps Sebastian's free hand.

                                PRIS
                  And my Aunt Mary.

        Sebastian turns and there's Aunt Mary, modest and warm.

                                PRIS
                  And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian,
                  everybody.

        Sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex-
        cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention.

                                BATTY
                  Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.
                  If you hadn't come along...

                                MARY
                  We were worried to death.  It's
                  awfully kind of you.

        Sebastian is nodding and smiling.

                                BATTY
                  We're not used to the big city.
                  Where we come from it's not so
                  easy to get lost.

                                MARY
                  You certainly have a nice place
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  Well stocked.

        Batty looks around admiringly.  Sebastian mumbles some-
        thing that sounds like "Thank you."

                                PRIS
                  Sebastian doesn't like to go out
                  too much.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I keep a lot of provisions right
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  I like a man who stays put.  An
                  admirable thing to be able to
                  sustain yourself in these times.
                  You live here all by yourself, do
                  you?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, no, not really.  There's
                  Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman,
                  he lives on the first floor.

        Everybody nods.  A long pause.

                                MARY
                  We haven't found it easy, Mr.
                  Sebastian.

        They glance around the room, waiting for Sebastian to
        pick up the ball.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How about breakfast, I was just
                  going to make some.

                                BATTY
                  If it wouldn't be too much of a
                  bother... a little bite to eat
                  would be...

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

                                BATTY
                  Well, actually

                                MARY
                  We're famished.

        Sebastian is truly happy.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Okay, then.  You make yourselves
                  comfortable and I'll bring the
                  food right out.

        He disappears into the kitchen.  Batty looks happy with
        the way things are going.

                                BATTY
                  Charming.

        Pris comes up close.  Her tone muted but demanding.

                                PRIS
                  Well?

        Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even
        more pugnacious.

                                PRIS
                  I want to know what's going on.

        There's a punitive edge to Batty's response.

                                BATTY
                  There's only three of us left.

        Pris is shocked.  Her whisper comes out a hiss.

                                PRIS
                  Then we're stupid and we'll die.

                                BATTY
                  Not if everybody is doing their
                  job here at home.  How are things
                  at home?

        A little spotted pig on the table sits up.

                                PIG
                  Home again, jiggidy jig.

        They all turn and stare at the pig.  Batty is delighted.

                                PRIS
                  I don't trust him.  I don't think
                  he knows what he's doing.

        The BELL-TONE from the microwave goes off in the kitchen.

                                BATTY
                  He knows what he's doing.

                                MARY
                  If he won't cooperate?

                                BATTY
                  Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants
                  to be appreciated.  We'll
                  appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

        INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR AND ROOM - DAY                   77

        Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an
        iron lung.  A little above his head, facing him, is a
        bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions.

        Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend.

        Holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't
        move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate
        the canary.

                                DECKARD
                  How are you doing, old man?

        Holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper
        that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm
                  not really great, but I feel just
                  great.  How you like my new suit?

                                DECKARD
                  Well, you don't have to worry
                  about getting it wrinkled.

        Holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little
        spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't make me laugh.  It makes me
                  pee.

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                HOLDEN
                  Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee.
                  So how are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm doing okay.

                                HOLDEN
                  From what I hear you're doing
                  great.  Bryant tells me you're
                  going like a god damn one-man
                  army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.
                         (pause)
                  But that's what I wanted to talk
                  to you about.

                                HOLDEN
                  Money?

                                DECKARD
                  No.  I got a problem.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let's hear it.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'm starting to empathize
                  with these Nexus-sixes.

        Holden giggles.  Starts to laugh again.  A blue light
        on the panel begins to turn very bright.  They both
        notice it.

                                DECKARD
                  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm taking a piss.

        They wait for the light to abate.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let me ask you something, Deck.
                  You been having intimate relations
                  with one of these units?

        Deckard doesn't deny it.  Holden smiles like a cherub.

                                HOLDEN
                  That's what I thought... one of
                  the liabilities of the trade --
                  you has sex with your prey, old
                  buddy.  That's bound to create
                  problems, unless you're a black
                  widow.

        Deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling.

                                DECKARD
                  What about -- not sex -- but love?

        Holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of
        his voice, but he can't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Love is just another name for sex.
                  Love is sexy and sex is lovely --
                  I don't care what you call it, an
                  android can't have it.

                                DECKARD
                  These aren't just...

                                HOLDEN
                  I know what they are, Deck --
                  Look, maybe they can pretend to
                  feel, but far as the raw, hot
                  emotions of the old heart -- no
                  way.

        Holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.

                                HOLDEN
                  Believe me, take it from an old
                  pro, no matter how good we get,
                  we're never gonna make an
                  artificial anything that can
                  feel.  It's a contradiction.
                  You might as well go fuck your
                  washing machine.

        Holden laughs, Deckard doesn't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Just go out there and keep up
                  the good work.

        Holden's whispers have become harder to hear.

                                HOLDEN
                  Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting
                  sleepy.  It's been good talking
                  to you.

        Deckard stands.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        But he's already asleep.  Deckard stands there a moment
        looking at him, then walks out.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          78

        He's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative.
        There's a SOUND.  His eyes move to the door.  Those
        locks are opening again.  Rachael comes in.  Looks
        surprised to see him.  Him too.

                                RACHAEL
                  I told you I'd come back.

                                DECKARD
                  You did?

                                RACHAEL
                  You didn't hear me.  You were
                  sleeping.

        He likes that.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you glad I'm here?

        He is.  She's spunky.  Hasn't seen this place in the
        daytime.  Pleased, he watched her move around the mess.
        She spots a little framed photograph.  Picks it up.
        It's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail.

                                RACHAEL
                  Who is this?

                                DECKARD
                  Me and my dad.

                                RACHAEL
                  Where is he?

                                DECKARD
                  Dead.

                                RACHAEL
                  Oh.

        She puts it down and comes to him.

                                RACHAEL
                  How come you're not on the job?

                                DECKARD
                  I am.  Part of my job is to sit
                  on a couch and try and figure
                  things out.

                                RACHAEL
                  How are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  Not too good.

        She sits next to him.

        Pleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight
        ahead.  He looks at her.  She looks at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do people do in the afternoon?

                                DECKARD
                  If they are smart, they take
                  naps.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAY                            79

        They're under the sheet.  Rachael is on her back, look-
        ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over
        the pillow.  Deckard lies next to her, a man studying
        a treasure.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you dream?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  Sometimes.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wish I could.

        His hand moves over her shoulder.

                                DECKARD
                  Wishing is a kind of dreaming.

        His hand goes under the sheet.

                                RACHAEL
                  I mean asleep.

        She feels good.  He moves closer.

                                RACHAEL
                  Did you cry when your father
                  died?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's another thing I can't
                  do.

        He kisses her lightly on the cheek.

                                RACHAEL
                  Nobody is freer than when he
                  dreams.  I read that.

                                DECKARD
                  It wasn't very good last night,
                  was it?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know, I have nothing
                  to compare it to.  I guess I
                  thought there was something
                  more to it.

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know... I think I missed
                  something.

                                DECKARD
                  Like?

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm not sure.  Is there a
                  secret?

        Her face is close.  She's looking right at him.  Her
        lips are right there.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.  If there is I'd
                  like to find it.

        Slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her
        body.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        80

        Batty, Pris and Mary sit at the table staring at their
        host.  Sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to
        his mouth, looking from face to face.  Although nothing
        is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at
        home with them as he is with his animoids.

                                BATTY
                  Why are you staring at us?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're just all so... so different.

        Batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and
        Sebastian is certainly getting it.

                                BATTY
                  What, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're androids.

        A long pause.

                                PRIS
                  What makes you think so?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're all so perfect.

        Sebastian is smiling from ear to ear.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What generation are you?

                                BATTY
                  Nexus - 6.
        
        Sebastian whistles.  Mary's head is shaking slightly.
        Pris gets up and moves to the couch.  Batty couldn't
        be more pleased.

                                BATTY
                  We can trust Sebastian, ladies.
                  He's been working with mechanisms
                  all his life.  He's a wizard and
                  a very perceptive man.

        Sebastian looks like a kid on Christmas Eve.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Could you...

        His voice is trembling.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Show me something?

                                BATTY
                  Like what?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Like...

        Like a million things, but he's too excited to think of
        one.

                                BATTY
                  We're not computers, Sebastian,
                  we're physical.

        Pris perks up proudly.

                                PRIS
                  I think, therefore I am.

                                BATTY
                  Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

        It's a command Pris is pleased to obey.  She sits quiet-
        ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper.
        Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming.

        Those hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster
        than the eye can see and slam down on either side of
        her, digging into the material with such ferocity that
        Sebastian jumps.  She plunges into the guts of the couch
        up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff-
        ing.  Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like
        an angel.

        Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
        he's just seen the devil.  He laughs nervously, glad
        that the devil is a friend.

                                BATTY
                  We have a lot in common.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You mean that you can't come here
                  and I can't go there?

                                BATTY
                  Not only that, but we have smiliar
                  problems.  Accelerated decrepitude.
                  But we don't want to die quite yet.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Of course not.

                                BATTY
                  You could help us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I don't know much about biomechanics,
                  Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out
                  of my league.

                                BATTY
                  If we don't find help soon, Pris
                  hasn't got long to live.

        Sebastian sneaks a glance.  Pris is staring at him with
        big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved
        but helpless.

                                BATTY
                  What about your friend, the man
                  who owns this building?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Dr. Tyrell?

        Batty nods.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He's not really my friend.  I just
                  do a job for him now and then.

                                BATTY
                  Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He could?

                                BATTY
                  His company made us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'd be happy to mention it to him.

                                BATTY
                  Be better if I could talk to him
                  in person.  But he's not an easy
                  man to get to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No.

                                BATTY
                  When do you deliver your project?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  This afternoon.

        Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's
        eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Will you help us?

        There's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he
        wanted to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.

        Pris sits up smiling.  Mary sighs a breath of relief
        and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude.

                                BATTY
                  I'm sure glad you found us,
                  Sebastian.  What do you think,
                  Mary?

                                MARY
                  I don't think there is another
                  human being in this whole world
                  who would have helped us.

                                BATTY
                  Pris?

        Pris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him.

        That has a lot of impact.  Sebastian looks around try-
        ing to keep the tears from coming.

                                BATTY
                  You're our best and only friend.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY                  81

        Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's
        shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around
        the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a
        man who died a voluptuous death.

                                RACHAEL
                  When was the last time you cleaned
                  this place?

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmm?

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever cleaned your
                  apartment?

                                DECKARD
                  Don't be fooled by appearances.

                                RACHAEL
                  It appears to be dirty -- why don't
                  you get somebody?

        He rolls over to admire her legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Because they would ruin the
                  arrangement.

        He kisses the back of her thigh.

                                RACHAEL
                  They could clean around the
                  arrangement.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like people snooping around
                  my stuff.

        He kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the
        bathroom.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  There's a vacuum in the front room
                  closet is you wanna give it a try.

        Rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into
        the front room and opens the closet door.  The vacuum is
        not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  As
        she starts to plug it in --

                                DECKARD
                  Oh no, don't do that.

        He's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway.

                                RACHAEL
                  But if I don't plug it in how can
                  I...

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind the plug, just go
                  through the motions.

                                RACHAEL
                  But then how can you...

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like the noise.  Just
                  practice.  Practice makes perfect.

        She stares at him like he's nuts.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me
                  how you would do it.

        Reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the
        thing.

                                DECKARD
                  How about under the couch there.
                  Come on.

        She bends over to get it.  Deckard pulls up a chair and
        sits down with his chin in his hands.  She looks back
        at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  This feels stupid.

                                DECKARD
                  Good for a smart girl to feel
                  stupid.  Part of your education.

        She drops the vacuum and sits on the floor.  Deckard
        gets up and comes towards her.  Her eyes travel halfway
        down his sheet and she leaves.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're sick, Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  I never felt better.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             82

        Mansion and opulent grounds.  Sebastian's humble truck
        parked among richer relations, including a spinner and
        a 1928 Dusenberg.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION - DUSK                              83

        The den.  It contains a collection of big game trophies,
        and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and
        proper with an "egg" the size of a basketball in his
        lap.

        Old Hannibal Chew was right, the rich make you wait.
        Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between
        the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION POOL - DUSK                         84

        Tyrell's young WIFE sits on the diving board watching
        her husband in the pool with their youngest TOT.  And
        two older LADS swim around trying to outdo each other
        for their dad's attention.

        From the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the
        fun, then continues with a tray of mugs towards the
        house.

        EXT. PLATEAU - DUSK                                     85

        And beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds, a
        figure stands watching, waiting like a bird of prey.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             86

        On a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, Tyrell
        turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom.
        The moment is sweetened by the LOW PLAINTIVE BELLOW of
        one of the animals.

        He strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro-
        ceeds up the steps and into his mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 87

        Next to a tray of cookies and milk, Sebastian sits pa-
        tiently with the "egg" in his lap.  As the door opens
        he gets to his feet expectantly.  It's STYLES, Tyrell's
        bodyguard.  He could play the Giant in Jack and The
        Beanstalk.

                                STYLES
                  Okay, I'll take that now.

        Sebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but
        Styles takes it and is almost through the door when
        Sebastian stops him.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Wait!

        He almost forgot.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Can't fly without the pilot.

        Sebastian hands him a little box.  Styles stuffs it in
        his pocket and shuts the door behind him.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - NIGHT                            88

        Motionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat-
        ues in the grass.  Suddenly they swing their shaggy
        heads to watch something pass.

        In the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious
        beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DINING ROOM - NIGHT                         89

        It's a medieval-sized hall.  The piece de resistance is
        an 18th Century, English painting of an Arab stallion,
        gleaming like coal over the CRACKLING fireplace.

        The entire family is seated at the table which glitters
        for the festive occasion.  Presents gathered around the
        oldest child.

        Styles hands the "egg" to Tyrell.  A hush falls over
        the table.  This is Dad's big present.  Tyrell sets is
        down before the boy.

        IAN is a fresh, slim lad who is ten today.  He looks up
        at his father, then, beaming, pries open the "egg's"
        hinged lid.  Tyrell's hand goes to his pocket and the
        griffon steps out of the shell.

                                IAN
                  Oh!

        Basically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage,
        the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no
        more than eight pounds.  It cranes its neck and testing
        its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the
        edge of the table and into the air.

        The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats
        its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling.  Turn-
        ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a
        dive.

        Delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon
        swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length
        of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over
        the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan.

        Reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and
        flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads
        its tail and comes in for an awkward landing.  They're
        laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and
        knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian.

                                IAN
                  Papa!  Did you make this?

                                TYRELL
                  No.  We can make man, but not a
                  griffon.

        He bends down and kisses his wife.

                                TYRELL
                  Have to give the cottage industry
                  a chance too.

        Pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 90

        Tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk.  Sebastian
        hands down the invoices.  Tyrell glances over them and
        writes out a check.

        He looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against
        the wall, by the door.  For a fraction of a second he's
        shocked, but recovers fast.

                                TYRELL
                  A friend of yours, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes, this is someone who wants to
                  talk to you, Dr. Tyrell.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Oh?

        Very slowly Tyrell's hand moves towards the back side
        of the desk.

                                BATTY
                  To act without understanding could
                  lead to the very thing the act
                  seeks to avoid.

        What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning.  Tyrell
        decides to heed it.

                                BATTY
                  A little talk it all I need.

        Tyrell looks at Sebastian.  Considers consequences.
        Back to Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to talk in private
                  then.

        Batty thinks it over.

                                BATTY
                  Yeah.  It might be better if we
                  talk in private, Sebastian.  Why
                  don't you go home.

                                TYRELL
                  Here's your check, my boy.  Thank
                  you.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you, Dr. Tyrell.  I'll see
                  you later.

        He slips out closing the door behind him.  Opens it
        again and sticks his head it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Was everything okay?

                                TYRELL
                  Just beautiful.

        He's gone.

        If Tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing
        it.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm surprised you didn't come to
                  me sooner.

                                BATTY
                  It's not an easy thing to meet
                  your maker.

                                TYRELL
                  And what can he do for you?

                                BATTY
                  Can the maker repair what he makes?

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to be modified?

                                BATTY
                  Had in mind something a little more
                  radical.

                                TYRELL
                  What's the problem?

                                BATTY
                  Death.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm afraid that's a little out of
                  my...

        Batty cuts in with a whisper.

                                BATTY
                  I want more life, fucker.

                                TYRELL
                  Come here.

        Batty walks forward.

                                TYRELL
                  Sit down.

        Batty does.

                                TYRELL
                  The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.
                  To make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system, at least by men, makers
                  or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence
                  can't be revised once it's
                  established.

                                BATTY
                  Why?

                                TYRELL
                  Because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation give
                  rise to revertant colonies -- like
                  rats leaving a sinking ship.  The
                  ship sinks.

                                BATTY
                  What about E.M.S. recombination?

                                TYRELL
                  We've already tried it -- ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
                  creates a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table.

        Batty nods grimly.

                                BATTY
                  Then a repressor protein that blocks
                  the operating cells.

                                TYRELL
                  Wouldn't obstruct replication, but
                  it does give rise to an error in
                  replication, so that the newly
                  formed DNA strand carries a
                  mutation and you're got a virus
                  again... but all this is academic
                  -- you are made as good as we could
                  make you.

                                BATTY
                  But not to last.

                                TYRELL
                  Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are
                  made to last -- as least they were.
                  But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari.
                  A high strung racing car -- built
                  to win, not to last.

        Batty smiles bitterly.

                                TYRELL
                  Also you're too valuable to
                  experiment with.

                                BATTY
                  I am?

        Tyrell can't help a flash of pride.

                                TYRELL
                  The bast of all possible androids.
                  We're proud of our prodigal son --
                  glad you're returned.  You're quite
                  a prize.

        Shoulders hunched, Batty looks down, an uncharacteristic
        note of guilt in his voice.

                                BATTY
                  I've done some questionable things.

                                TYRELL
                  Also extraordinary things.

                                BATTY
                  Nothing the God of biomechanics
                  wouldn't let you in heaven for.

        They share a laugh.  In spite of himself, there's a look
        of relief in Tyrell's face as Batty extends his hand.
        Tyrell takes it and they shake.  The reverence in Bat-
        ty's eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile.  The smile
        turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
        crack.  Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty
        stifles it.

        Tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking
        into his face.  Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's
        head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the
        man's head like a melon.  The mess is not small.

        Palms up, like a surgeon, Batty walks to the drapes and
        wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out
        of the room.

        INT. TYRELL - HALL TO KITCHEN - NIGHT                   90A

        Styles is coming down the hall.  He sees Batty coming
        towards him.  Styles looks at him curiously, this is not
        one of the guests.  As they close, Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  Could you tell me where the
                  bathroom is?

        Styles doesn't get a chance to answer.  Batty's hand has
        torn into his crotch.  The man is lifted off the floor,
        up the wall and held a moment.  Whatever is encased in
        his pelvis is pulverized.  Batty lets go.  Styles hits
        the floor.  He died of shock.  Grinding his teeth, Batty
        continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES.

        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                91

        The birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit.  They're
        waiting for Dad.  Mrs. Tyrell looks around to find Batty
        observing from the doorway.

        A little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor-
        porate wife, she smiles.

                                MRS. TYRELL
                  May I help you?

        Batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets.

        INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    92

        In the sink the faucet is on.  The water pink with
        blood.  Batty is washing his hands.

        A portly maid emerges from the pantry.  Batty looks up.
        She stops, embarrassed at being caught.  Her eyes no-
        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
        door.  When she looks back, Batty is right in front of
        her.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                          93

        Books scattered on the bed.  Rachael sitting cross-
        legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite
        shots of nature.  Deckard is next to her, watching her
        like a lover, like a father.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She'd never seen the great outdoors.
                  Never even seen books on the
                  subject.  She went through
                  everything I had, and we talked.
                  And there were subjects we didn't
                  discuss and they were words we
                  didn't say, I couldn't say, like
                  death, like future, like real.  But
                  it was hard because she was curious
                  and full of questions.  She was
                  more alive than anyone I'd ever
                  known.

        She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with
        no need to comment.  It's in her eyes.  She stares at
        him, a revelation taking shape.

                                RACHAEL
                  You and I are good friends, huh?

        He considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the
        wonder of it.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's so easy.

        Convinced and not convinced, he nods his head.  She
        laughs at his solemnity.  She's irresistible.  Deckard's
        pretty irresistible himself.

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever known anybody a long
                  time?

                                DECKARD
                  You mean a woman?

                                RACHAEL
                  Uh-huh.

                                DECKARD
                  What's a long time?

                                RACHAEL
                  Ten years.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.  Nobody could stand me that
                  long.

        The CHIME on the PHONE next to the bed GOES OFF.  He
        reaches out and brings it to his ear.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  She's not with you?

                                DECKARD
                  Who.

        A pause.

                                BRYANT
                  Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth
                  floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia
                  South.

                                DECKARD
                  Got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his
                  family and half his staff were just
                  massacred.  The cat is about to get
                  out of the bag.  Pressure is
                  definitely on.  The Nexus program
                  is terminated.  When you finish
                  there, locate Nexus designated Rachael
                  and retire.

        Deckard says nothing.

                                BRYANT
                  If you don't, we will.  It has to
                  be total, Deckard.  That's an order
                  from as high as it comes.  Got it?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  I got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Go.

        He hangs up the receiver and gets up.  She watches him
        from the bed.  The gun goes into his belt.  He loads
        the ankle job and straps it on.  She watches every move.

                                RACHAEL
                  Why do you call it retire, why
                  don't you call it murder?

                                DECKARD
                  Because it's not.

                                RACHAEL
                  Don't you think anything that can
                  suffer deserves to be considered?

                                DECKARD
                  Andies only simulate suffering --
                  if they're programmed for it.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you think I simulated what
                  happened between us?

                                DECKARD
                  No, I don't.

        Without looking at her, he puts on his jacket.

        He's standing in the middle of the floor with his back
        to her.  He turns and they're facing one another.
        Neither of them moves.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't leave here.  Don't open the
                  door, don't answer the phone.

                                RACHAEL
                  What difference will it make?

                                DECKARD
                  Just wait here.

        He goes to the door.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what I think?

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  That some of the folks around here
                  are more programmed then me.

        He has to laugh.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what else I think?

                                DECAKRD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  This was the best day of my life.

        He turns and goes through the door.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      94

        Sebastian is putting his work table in order, but his
        mind is not with it and his hands are trembling.

        Batty, Pris and Mary are on the other side of the room
        talking:  their voices low.

                                MARY
                  Let's go while there is still
                  time.

                                BATTY
                  Where?

                                MARY
                  Anywhere.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  What's the point?

                                MARY
                  Not to be trapped.

                                BATTY
                  You underestimate the trap, Mary.

        Sebastian has almost reached the door.

                                BATTY
                  Where are you going, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Just thought I'd...

                                BATTY
                  No, you stay here with us.  Out
                  last night together.

        They all watch.

        Sebastian walks away from the door.

                                BATTY
                  Think of yourself as a light, Mary.
                  Shine before you're turned off.

        She's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to
        Pris.  She and Batty hold a look that burns.

        Sebastian is by the window.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Someone is coming here.

        Batty goes to the window and looks down.

                                BATTY
                  One man.
                         (he smiles)
                  He must be good.

                                MARY
                  Then go get him.

                                BATTY
                  That wouldn't be very sporting.

        Sebastian looks ready to bolt.  Batty puts an arm
        around him.

                                PRIS
                  I want to do it.

                                BATTY
                  Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a
                  little for everybody.  A
                  masterpiece.

        A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Turn out the lights, Pris.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      95

        In the dim, nocturnal light, Deckard crosses into the
        courtyard fronting the building and stops.  He looks
        around.  Nobody there, just silence.

        He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-
        dows off to one side of the entry.

        His head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS.

        Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
        pavement thirty feet below.

        Deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-
        tered window on the next-to-top floor.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT                96

        Not much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he
        crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of
        least exposure.  He looks around.  Elevator and stair-
        well.

        Close to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep-
        ing an eye on the stairwell door.

        Stepping to one side, he hits the button.  The elevator
        door slides open.  He reaches in, presses a button and
        as the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between
        the doors, jamming the operation.

        Deckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the
        lobby floor.  He pauses a moment in front of the stair-
        well door, then pushes it open and:

        INT. STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97

        Steps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he
        spins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in-
        to the figure hovering to his left.

        The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into
        the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his
        chest... but he was already dead.

        Deckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the
        old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were
        feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard
        gets to his feet.

        The stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot
        touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters
        the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young
        girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY
        STOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his
        laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,
        descends the basement stairs.

        INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT                                   98

        At the bottom he faces a corridor.  The FAINT HUM OF
        MACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end.
        The HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there.
        Each door is fitted with a small window.  Deckard
        steps to the side and peers through.

        INT. GYM - NIGHT                                        99

        It's a gym.  The mirror-lined walls are cracked and
        tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.
        The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two
        weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away
        like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.

        She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the
        shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.
        Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly
        swaying.

        Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
        the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,
        keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
        door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-
        ing.  Deckard's in his element.

        Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It
        isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his
        eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.

        It's not something he has time to consider.  In the
        mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.
        Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,
        crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
        neck.

        Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't
        notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood
        to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.
        As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'
        fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens
        like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his
        eyes roll back into his head.

                                PRIS
                  Naughty, naughty.

        She lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot
        into his back.  He's propelled fifteen feet across the
        room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.
        Pris flies off the rings and comes at him.

        Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-
        ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,
        she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the
        floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches
        out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
        the machine.

        It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally
        an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing
        on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A
        bad place for flesh and bone.

        But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-
        year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds
        his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull
        his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but
        it's welded in hers.

        His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,
        wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
        his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard
        hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up
        and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard
        rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
        driver.

        Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.
        Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him
        across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of
        work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.

        He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.
        It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like
        it was ice, weight stand in tow.

        Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces
        it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound
        dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It
        knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his
        foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets
        her with a roundhouse in the face.

        She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell
        over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her
        life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts
        him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and
        lands in a heap.

        No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She
        rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-
        head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down
        for the kill, she freezes.

        Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.
        As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.

        He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and
        takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming
        her rage.  He FIRES as she comes.

        The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but
        her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily
        in front of her as she charges forward.

        He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a
        rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
        next to Deckard.  Dead.

        He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls
        over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-
        gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.
        The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It
        might not sound like a war cry, but it is.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   100

        Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors
        and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                  101

        Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his
        loads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shoot
        the next thing that moves and find out later if he was
        right or wrong.

        INT. STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT                   101A

        On the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyes
        move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.
        None.  He continues up the stairs.

        INT. NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT                                102

        On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.
        Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the
        hall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.
        Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If
        somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.

        He kicks the door open and dives through head first
        and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the
        far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's
        a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both
        closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No
        response from either door.

        Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly
        Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the
        closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.

        Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand
        out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
        it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed
        monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her
        body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.
        Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary
        falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.

        Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
        closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes
        off her.

        Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his
        hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in
        his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.

        A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.

        A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.
        A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
        gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the
        couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet
        in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the
        apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster
        dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:

                                DECKARD
                  Hello, Roy.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103

        Deckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time,
        he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor.
        He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door,
        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG.
        The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is
        empty.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104

        Moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he
        gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he
        turns the know and pushed open the door.

        INT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105

        Except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's
        nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to-
        wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds
        like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the
        hallway.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106

        Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the
        hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap
        and gym shoes, he's nude.

                                BATTY
                  You wanna play?

        Deckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway.
        Pops out again.

                                BATTY
                  Not very sporting to fire on an
                  unarmed opponent.  I thought you
                  were supposed to be good.  Aren't
                  you the man?!

        The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman-
        che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his
        insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol-
        len, trembling from the thrill of it.

                                BATTY
                  This is how we do it up there, lad!
                  Come on!

        In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the
        hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast
        that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur
        crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh.

        Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact
        of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be-
        hind him.

        He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head.
        Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face.
        Batty kneels next to him.

                                BATTY
                  Not hurt, are you?  You better get
                  it up or I'm going to have to kill
                  you.  Unless you're alive you can't
                  play.  And if you don't play, you
                  don't get to be alive.

        Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales
        and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with
        his chest and starts to push.

                                BATTY
                  That's the spirit.

        Like a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's
        on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the
        doors.

        Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and
        picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall,
        towards the jeering voice.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Come on, Deckard, show me what you
                  got!  I'm right here on the other
                  side of the door.  But you gotta
                  shoot straight 'cause I'm fast!

        Deckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and
        FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty.

        INT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107

        The full length mirror on the other side of the room
        SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand
        and steps in closer.

                                BATTY
                  Straight doesn't seem to be good
                  enough.

        They're face to face.

                                BATTY
                  You don't have a chance, do you?

        In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops
        his head to the side.

                                BATTY
                  Looks like I'm gonna have to scale
                  it down for you.  Give you a
                  handicap.  I won't run through any
                  more walls.  Okay?  I promise to
                  use the doors.  Okay?

        Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud-
        denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out
        the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar
        and rams his head into the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Come on, let's use that brain!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108

        He drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his
        head into the wall again.

                                BATTY
                  Think!  We need a little
                  resilience around here!

        He yanks him further and bashes his head again.

                                BATTY
                  Where are those balls of yours?!
                  Let's see a little bravery!

        The storm passes.

        Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry.

                                BATTY
                  That was irrational of me -- not
                  to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't
                  happen again.

        He drops him.

                                BATTY
                  I'll be down the hall when you're
                  ready.

        Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors.

        Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo-
        ment, then punches it with his fist.

        On his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath
        so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No
        sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby.
        He doesn't bother.

        Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He
        had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but
        he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns.

        On the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land-
        ing below, looking up at him.

                                BATTY
                  Where you going?

        He wait a moment for Deckard's answer.

                                BATTY
                  No cheating.  A promise is a
                  promise.  I'll honor the
                  handicapped, but we gotta play on
                  the top floor.  You go get your
                  laser gun now.  And I'll give you
                  a few seconds before I come.

        Deckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles.

        Deckard's running down the corridor.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  One!

        Halfway down the hall he finds his laser.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Two!

        Deckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment
        above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard
        considers it.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  No fair jumping through holes.  You
                  might get hurt doing that!  THREE!

        Deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door
        and goes in.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109

        His eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage.
        He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is
        dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails
        protruding.  Too small.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110

        Batty's coming up the steps.

                                BATTY
                  Five!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111

        Deckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers
        the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with
        a line to the door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112

        Batty's coming down the center, listening at the doors.

                                BATTY
                  Six!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113

        Deckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at
        his hand.  It's trembling.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Seven!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114

        Batty's standing in front of a door, listening.

                                BATTY
                  Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in
                  here, I don't think.  Eight!

        He goes to the next door.

                                BATTY
                  Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like
                  it.  Nine!

        Batty moves to the next.  The door to Deckard.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      115

        Deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk
        about a hair trigger... Silence.  Batty's FEET are heard
        CREAKING AWAY.  Deckard looks around.  Runs a hand over
        the wall behind him.  Batty's FEET COME BACK.  A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Ten!

        The door explodes!

        A shape hurtles across the room.  Deckard pivots, fol-
        lowing it with RAPID FIRE.  It's a TV.  He spins back.
        but Batty's already on him.  He gets one SHOT off be-
        fore Batty's got his hand.  There's a hole over Batty's
        right eye.  Blood running down his face, dripping on
        Deckard.  The right side of his face isn't working too
        good.  The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut --
        his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.

                                BATTY
                  One point for you.

        The would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes
        it more malignant.  He throws Deckard against the far
        wall.  Deckard FIRES.  Hits Batty in the shoulder.

                                BATTY
                  Ho ho!  Try it again!

        He comes at Deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in
        fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement
        as Deckard tries to get a shot, FIRING AWAY until his
        laser's empty.  Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up
        against him.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Don't you like me?
                  I'm what we've made!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           116

        He's backing Deckard out the door.  Deckard trips and
        falls.  There's fear on his face.  The strength is gone.
        Something is starting to crack.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover
                  of Faster, Bigger and Better?!

        Deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.

                                BATTY
                  It's time to die.

        Deckard throws the laser at him.  It misses.  Batty
        throws his head back and laughs.  A one-eyed colossus
        about to eat the world.  Suddenly he stops.  His eye
        moves over the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Ah!

        He reaches out and pinches something.  His lips compress
        as he yanks it out of the wall.  It's a ten-penny nail.

        He holds it out to Deckard and drops it.  Deckard
        catches it.

                                BATTY
                  That's for you.

        One side of Batty's face smiles savagely.

                                BATTY
                  Stick it in your ear and push.
                  If that doesn't work, try the
                  eye.

        Deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at
        his executioner.

                                BATTY
                  Believe me, it'll be better
                  for you than what I'm about
                  to do.

        Batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire
        his victim to more action.  It doesn't look like it.

                                BATTY
                  Well?

        Deckard springs to his feet and bolts.  But instead of
        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
        door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT                   117

        Provocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei-
        surely towards the door.  Deckard's terrified scream
        and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him.  Batty speeds
        up and moves into the room.

        The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out,
        bellowing in the wind.

                                BATTY
                  Crap.

        He walks up to the window.  Deckard comes away from the
        wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed
        at the base of Batty's skull.  Batty starts to lean
        over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he
        knows.  He spins...

        Deckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls
        like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.

        Deckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his
        head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe
        again.
        
        On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's
        ankle.

        With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
        banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-
        ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the
        hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops
        the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead
        fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.

        Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He
        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           118

        Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along.
        He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the
        last couple feet to the stairwell.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119

        Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's
        body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,
        then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-
        ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the
        edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds
        and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As
        Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the
        railing.

        Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement
        floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost
        four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.
        
        With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-
        ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's
        fingers are starting to slip.

        His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over
        Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything
        he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The
        thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.

        The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but
        Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.
        He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.
        He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
        left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-
        hand grip.

        Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't
        be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over
        the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
        onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.

        And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly
        clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's
        his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware
        of.

        Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one
        foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120

        Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into
        the morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has
        begun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
        very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard
        is glad to see it.

        For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
        breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the
        street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to
        fall.

        Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-
        lapses on the front seat.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121

        In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a
        chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The
        only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING
        that comes from the bed.

        Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies
        sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.

        Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down
        at her.

        Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
        the bed.

        Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.

        EXT. COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY                        122

        Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He
        and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion-
        al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold
        shine of an icy dream.

        The clouds overhead are soft and swift.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She wanted to go to a place I knew.
                  Out of the city.  Like one of those
                  pictures she saw.  Where there were
                  trees but no buildings.

        Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream
        by.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  We had a good time.  She told me a
                  funny story and I taught her a
                  song.  A song about monkeys and
                  elephants.  And it made us laugh so
                  hard we couldn't sing.

        EXT. WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY                              123

        Deckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and
        hushed before them.

        Down an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light
        slanting through the clean, hard limbs.

        The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in
        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.

        Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her
        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking
        lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she
        stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard.
        Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on
        knowing.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        124

        Deckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly,
        mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  His
        gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears
        running down his pale cheeks.

        But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted
        snow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into the
        silence of the freezing white landscape.

        EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                    125

        Deckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along like
        some metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of the
        long, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-
        ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silence
        astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN.

        INT. CAR - NIGHT                                        126

        Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-
        ing straight ahead.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I told myself over and over again,
                  if I hadn't done it, they would
                  have.

                  I didn't go back to the city, not
                  that city, I didn't want the job.

                  She said the great advantage of
                  being alive was to have a choice.
                  And she chose.  And a part of me
                  was almost glad.  Not because she
                  was gone but because this way they
                  could never touch her.

                  As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,
                  but he wasn't dead.  For a long
                  time I wanted to kill him.  But
                  what was the point?  There were too
                  many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.
                  Maybe real and unreal could never
                  be separated.  The secret never
                  found.  But I got as close with
                  her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd
                  stay with me a long time.  I guess
                  we made each other real.

        And the ruby lights of Deckard's car disappear into
        the darkness.

                                                           Emil Cioran
          
          EXT. FOREST - DAWN
          
          Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white
          like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.
          
          STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a
          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A
          LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.
          
          A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as
          the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and
          rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.
          
          It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the
          forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces
          across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
          
          A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.
          Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
          his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.
          
          As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:
          
          P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
          
          About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,
          DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
          
          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
          
          The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked
          onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
          
          THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More
          cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.
          
          ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
          tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs
          and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers.
          
          THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a
          grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks
          around again, checking its surroundings for predators.
          
          THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering
          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
          familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
          
          THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the
          watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An
          interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
          
          Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,
          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.
          
                                                                  2.
          
          
          THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing
          and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.
          
          THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing
          him to us for the first time.
          
          He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
          with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work
          boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.
          
          Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a
          DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.
          
          Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
          hanging from a frayed twine cord.
          
          His name is ELI.
          
          He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches
          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood
          from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.
          
          Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
          falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
          FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.
          
          Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the
          ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the
          writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.
          
          He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.
          He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.
          Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.
          
          For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat
          and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie
          suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.
          
          A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to
          its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old
          SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.
          
          He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on
          his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK
          SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.
          
          EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
          asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.
          
                                                                    3.
          
          
          He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both
          directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-
          out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.
          
          The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.
          Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a
          MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.
          
          Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle
          but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually
          wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.
          
          They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.
          
          He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he
          walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
          loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in
          no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.
          
          The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now
          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.
          
          The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no
          color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
          leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.
          
          CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of
          a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
          from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED
          AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.
          
          Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on
          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
          the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.
          
          After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down
          the other fork, away from the city.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY
          
          Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli
          walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.
          Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.
          
          He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty
          shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even
          look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.
          
          Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-
          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.
          
                                                                    4.
          
          
                    ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR
          
          He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings
          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.
          
          INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
          cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
          floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
          
          Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
          idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
          
          As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
          box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
          hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
          
          He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
          grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
          
          On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
          broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.
          
          Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,
          overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting
          sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.
          
          INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
          
          The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
          revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
          unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
          
          Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
          Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
          largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
          
          KITCHEN
          
          Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
          the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
          
          He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
          ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
          
          Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
          Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
          enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.
          
                                                                  5.
          
          
          BEDROOM
          
          A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
          toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
          
          No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
          HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
          
          Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
          pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
          ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
          
          He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
          
          He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
          new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
          
          LATER
          
          Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
          over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
          watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
          it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
          
          He clasps his hands together in prayer.
          
                              ELI
                    Dear Lord, thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us today
                    with this bountiful feast.
          
          He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
          we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
          John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.
          
                              ELI
                    Thank you for the many gifts that
                    you have given me. Thank you for
                    your protection and your guidance.
                    Thank you for bringing me this far.
                    I know my long journey's end is
                    near. I ask now only for the
                    strength and the courage to
                    complete the task that you in your
                    infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
                    upon me over all men. I won't let
                    you down. Amen.
          
          He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
          a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
          relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Hey. You hungry?
          
          It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
          emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
          offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
          
          SUNDOWN
          
          The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
          broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
          SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
          
          He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
          OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
          eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
          
          Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
          beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
          
          He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
          sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
          
          MANY PAGES LATER
          
          Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
          Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
          
          A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
          a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
          reaches into his pocket and produces:
          
          AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
          with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
          cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
          
          The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
          Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
          
          THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
          as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
          the music to another world, a world far from this one.
          
          MORNING
          
          Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
          exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
          
          The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
          he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
          Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
          
          He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
          All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.
          
                                                                  7.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Come on now.
          
          The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
          into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
          
          The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.
          
          He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on
          his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead
          trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.
          
          The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
          world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road
          reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".
          
          Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli
          arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in
          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
          
          The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.
          
          She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
          from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
                    take anything you want. You want
                    some food? Take it.
          
          She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli
          stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to
          read behind the mirrored goggles.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not going to hurt you.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    That's what the last guys said.
          
          Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled
          contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.
          
                              ELI
                    Here.
          
                                                                    8.
          
          
          She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Could you help me? The wheel came
                    off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
                    could get it out of the ditch. But
                    I can't.
          
          Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just
          inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
          
          He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,
          revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,
          showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
          
          He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the
          cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.
          
          Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,
          waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They
          exchange anxious looks.
          
          ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.
          
                              ELI
                    One good thing about no soap any
                    more. You can smell the road agents
                    a mile off.
          
          The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits
          EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple
          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.
          
          The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
          passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
          
          He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.
          
          Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
          in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What you got there in the pack?
          
                               ELI
                    Nothing.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Yeah, that's what they all say. How
                    about you take it off real slow and
                    tip it out so's we can take a look?
          
                                                                  9.
          
          
          BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.
          
                              BANDIT #2
                    He's got a gun.
          
                               BANDIT LEADER
                    Shit, it ain't loaded. They never
                    are. Ain't that right, old man?
                        (BEAT)
                    Open the fucking pack or die.
          
                              ELI
                    I can't do that.
          
          The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within
          striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Want us to do it for you? We can
                    get it off real easy after we've
                    hacked your fucking arms off.
          
          Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,
          even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.
          
                              ELI
                    It's real important you boys listen
                    to me and understand. The man I
                    work for, you do not want to cross
                    him. See, I'm under his protection.
                    You stand in my way, you stand in
                    his. And he will cut you down with
                    a righteous fury - through me. For
                    I am his faithful instrument.
          
          BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and
          then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What the hell are you, some kinda
                    preacher?
          
                              ELI
                    Something like that.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Well I got news for you, preacher
                    man. Whatever kinda God you reckon
                    yourself to be working for, he left
                    these parts a long time ago. He
                    ain't here to protect your ass. Now
                    take off the pack and set it on the
                    ground.
          
                                                                 10.
          
          
          Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes
          another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    You fucking listening to me?
          
                              ELI
                    I hear you. You lay that hand on me
                    again and you will not get it back.
          
          The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how
          it's supposed to go.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    All right, I had just about enough
                    of this shit...
          
          He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.
          
          If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn
          his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and
          drips onto the asphalt.
          
          Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's
          shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The
          SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.
          
          Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
          where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What... you just... he just cut my
                    fucking hand off! My fucking hand!
          
          Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
          the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to
          the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What you standin' around for? Kiss
                    him!
          
                              BANDIT #3
                    What's he talkin' about, kiss him?
          
                              ELI
                    He's in shock. He means "kill him".
          
          A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
          ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.
          
          Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But
          it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.
          
                                                                    11.
          
          
          It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
          ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
          
          The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards
          away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.
          
                               ELI
                    I told you you wouldn't be getting
                    that back.
          
          Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
          on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a
          moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Eli.
          
          And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.
          
          He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.
          She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.
          
          He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the
          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches
          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.
          
                              ELI
                    Take it and go on your way. And
                    don't fall in with men like these
                    again. No good can come.
          
          She looks at him, puzzled.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Why are you doing this?
          
          Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches
          beside them and begins searching their bodies.
          
          He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo
          lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.
          
          LATER
          
          The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered
          with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.
          
          Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks
          quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
                              ELI
                    God, the father of mercies, through
                    the death and resurrection of his
                    son has reconciled the world to
                    himself and sent the holy spirit
                    among us for the forgiveness of
                    sins.
          
          The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him,
          transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.
          
                              ELI
                    Through the ministry of the church
                    may he give you pardon and peace,
                    and I absolve you from your sins in
                    the name of the father, and of the
                    son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.
          
          He turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Thank you. You're... a good man.
          
                              ELI
                    There are no good men on the road.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Where are you going?
          
                              ELI
                    West.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Can... can I come with you?
          
          He doesn't even turn back to look at her.
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
          He walks on, into the horizon.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
          
          Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a
          long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.
          
          He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
          overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out
          from where the roadway has been severed.
          
          Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the
          wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze.
          
                                                                 13.
          
          
          The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
          
          Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
          
          TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
          
          The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
          
          Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
          
          FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
          
          The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
          
          The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
          
          The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.
          
          Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for
          his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.
          
                              ELI
                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path. It ain't your concern. Stay
                    on the path.
          
          Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,
          but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and
          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And
          then finally, suddenly, is silenced.
          
          Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
          bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the
          wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.
          
          They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.
          
                                                                 14.
          
          
          Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into
          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.
          
          EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY
          
          Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs
          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY
          
          More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road
          forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.
          
          The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other
          fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.
          
          A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No
          words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
          FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.
          
          Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his
          pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.
          
          He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY
          
          A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like
          structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
          plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.
          
          HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many
          wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.
          
          Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he
          braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,
          entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
          
          It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
          
          It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.
          
                                                                 15.
          
          
          The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.
          
          Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,
          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.
          
                              ELI
                    You got an engineer or a fuelman
                    around here?
          
          The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions
          toward a storefront at the far end of the street.
          
                              ELI
                    Thanks.
          
          Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a
          STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely
          fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of
          a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.
          
          As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents
          take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.
          
          Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's
          face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
          PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
          together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.
          
          Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.
          They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry
          picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.
          
          Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like
          cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a
          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.
          
                              CHAIN GANG BOSS
                    Come on, move it!
          
          The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't
          return the look, just continues crossing the street as the
          blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a
          pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-
          APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.
          Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
          
          An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
          of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
          Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
          
          Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
          
          Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something.
          
          Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    I don't know you.
          
          Eli slowly raises his hands.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not from around here.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    No shit. Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm just a customer.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    A customer with a shotgun?
          
          He nods toward the shotgun visible on Eli's backpack.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You come in here to rip me off?
          
          The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the
          trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    No. I'll set it down. Okay?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Slowly!
          
          Eli nods. Unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You carry a gun in the outland, you
                    don't bring one into town less you
                    live there. Don't you know that?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on
                    the road a long time.
          
                                                                    17.
          
          
          This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Show me your hand.
          
                                 ELI
                    I'm not a-
          
          The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    I said show me your fucking hand!
          
          Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced
          downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of
          ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not one of them.
          
          The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
          little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    What do you want?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm just passing through. I need
                    some help. I can pay.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    What kinda help? And what kinda
                    pay?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm going to get something out of
                    my pack. Okay?
          
          The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.
          
                              ELI
                    I know, I know. Slowly.
          
          The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack
          and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.
          
                                 ENGINEER
                    Holy shit.
          
          Eli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with
          awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Where'd you find this?
          
                                                                 18.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Years ago, in the outland back east
                    aways.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Does it work?
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can
                    you do it? I got the cables.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Depends if you also got the coin.
          
          Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer
          picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It'll take a couple hours. There's
                    a bar across the street you can
                    wait, they just opened up.
          
                              ELI
                    I'll wait here.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You don't trust me?
          
                              ELI
                        (SMILES)
                    I don't know you.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAY
          
          This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn
          out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the
          stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.
          
          Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most
          prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an
          OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
          MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.
          
          The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but
          has no taste whatsoever.
          
          A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
          the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.
          
          The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title
          still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by
          the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very
          few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and
          unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well-
          groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.
          
          He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches,
          everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he
          looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.
          
          He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S.
          
          REDRIDGE stands before him. Tall, powerfully built.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What is it?
          
          His accent is like caramel. A RICH, DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Survey team just finished up their
                    inspection. It ain't good.
          
          Carnegie lowers his book. Concerned.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    How bad is it?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Pressure is down again, and going
                    by the new rod they sank levels're
                    lower than they've ever been.
          
          Carnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news.
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    How long?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A
                    little longer if we're careful. But
                    we're already-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Halve the rations.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We just halved `em last-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So halve them again!
          
          BEAT. Carnegie stares Redridge down. Nobody but nobody
          questions his orders.
          
                                                                 20.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    You're going to have to say
                    something. Folks were none too
                    happy last time. Gonna be worse
                    now, you can count on it.
          
          Carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. He knows Redridge is right.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has
          assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF
          CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.
          
          Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He
          treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a
          MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his
          words to the far reaches of the crowd.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I want you all to remember how far
                    we've come together. And how far we
                    still can go, if only we believe.
                    When I brought us here to this
                    oasis - this promised land - we
                    knew there would be hardships. Knew
                    there would be sacrifices. But we
                    also knew that we were creating for
                    ourselves a world where we could be
                    safe from the horrors of the
                    forsaken lands beyond our borders.
          
          The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word.
          He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his
          cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us
          of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And I want you all to remember
                    above all that it is not the water
                    with which we have been blessed
                    that is the true lifeblood of this
                    town... but faith.
          
          This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many
          don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie
          senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now
          with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It is our faith that sustains us,
                    brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!
          
                                                                 21.
          
          
          The crowd is divided. Many return the "Hallelujah" with
          varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But
          Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And mark me, the ultimate
                    validation of that faith is coming!
                    The sacred Word of Our Lord that
                    formed the world before and will
                    reform it once again is coming to
                    this town to bring it succor, bring
                    it nourishment, bring it new life!
                    For the Almighty Himself has spoken
                    unto me and promised it!
          
          Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the meantime, He has asked us
                    all to be patient. To walk the hard
                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer. And to do that, we must
                    give just a little more.
                        (BEAT)
                    Water rations will be halved until
                    further notice.
          
          This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some
          still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.
          
          Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I understand your frustration. The
                    road to salvation is a difficult
                    one - but what lies at the end of
                    that road is a greater glory,
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.
          
                              DISCONTENTED VILLAGER
                    We've heard this all before! When
                    are you going to-
          
          Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE
          MAN, removing him from the crowd. Dissent is not tolerated
          here. Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.
          
                                                                 22.
          
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    I know each and every one of you
                    will understand the necessity of
                    this action. It was faith that
                    built this town - and faith that
                    will sustain it even through the
                    dark times that may lie ahead. But
                    it is always darkest before dawn -
                    and the new dawn is coming.
                        (BEAT)
                    May God go with you all.
          
          Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among
          themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.
          
          As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.
          
          As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his
          bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each
          have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.
          
          We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the
          couple on the road under the freeway overpass.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
          
          Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the
          balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his
          grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.
          
          Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    One of the road crews just rolled
                    into town.
          
          Carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Of course they did, the bar's open.
                    Outlanders, always looking for
                    answers at the bottom of a bottle.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    Not these guys.
                        (BEAT)
                    These guys say they got something.
          
          That gets Carnegie's attention.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Get them up here now.
          
                                                                 23.
          
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the
          rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still
          impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
          leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.
          FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.
          
          The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON.
          Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A
          FIREPLACE sputters dimly.
          
          A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen
          or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.
          
          Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of
          his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR,
          licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie
          as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office".
          
          Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as
          when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance
          mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to
                    see you again! I understand your
                    latest excursion into the outland
                    has been a profitable one?
          
          The bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the
          words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks.
          
                              HOG
                    We did good.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, let's see, shall we?
          
          Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.
          
          BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and
          sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection.
          
          We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure
          Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The
          Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie.
          
          In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of
          OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED...
          
                                                                 24.
          
          
          ...And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING
          NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS
          AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC
          ALLIANCE. The headline reads: "IS THERE NO TURNING BACK?"
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    No. No. No. No. No.
          
          As Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and
          frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It's not here.
          
                              HOG
                    These ain't worth nothin'?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    When you bring me the book I asked
                    you for, it'll be worth something.
          
          The bikers exchange more looks. An unspoken conversation.
          
                              HOG
                    We been doin' this a long time now.
                    Had to make a whole lotta corpses
                    to bring you all these books. You
                    want us to keep at it, reckon it's
                    worth more than a few free glasses
                    of that swill you call liquor.
          
          Carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation.
          Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you
                    once again to take the long view
                    here. When we find this book - and
                    believe me, we will find it - we
                    are going to build a new world. A
                    world far greater, far more
                    righteous than this one. And you
                    and I are going to be perched right
                    on top of it, looking down upon it,
                    masters of all creation!
          
          As always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered
          with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion
          and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And you know, I think you're
                    absolutely right.

                                                                 25.
          
                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    That is worth more than a few
                    glasses of liquor. A whole lot
                    more.
          
          He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze
          like a laser beam, utterly disarming.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    The book I want is out there
                    somewhere, just waiting to be
                    found. Once there were millions of
                    copies - you only need to find one!
                    Find it and bring it here. And I
                    promise you, you will be rewarded
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          It's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. He's just so
          full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want
          to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet.
          
          Hog snatches up his empty satchel.
          
                              HOG
                    This better not be bullshit.
          
          He turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following.
          The guards escort them out, only Redridge remains.
          
          Carnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Might help if they knew just what
                    they were looking for.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Not one of them can read. How would
                    they even know when they found it?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    So how's about you just tell me?
          
          Carnegie and Redridge lock eyes. BEAT.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Two years now you been sending
                    these crews into the outland.
                    Burning up gas we can barely spare.
                    For a goddamn book? What the hell
                    kinda book can be worth all this?
          
          Carnegie ignores him. Stands, walks toward the door. Redridge
          sighs, gestures toward the books piled on Carnegie's desk.
          
                                                                 26.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What about these?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Put them with the others.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          Redridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books
          into the fire. The flames flicker and leap around the books
          as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
          
          Eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas
          generator, which chugs noisily.
          
          He licks his lips, dry as sand. Unscrews his canteen to take
          a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.
          
                              ELI
                    What's this place across the
                    street? They got any water?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    We got our own underground spring
                    here. Only fresh water in a hundred
                    miles - if's you can pay for it.
          
          Eli thinks a while longer. Then stands and stuffs his shotgun
          inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.
          
                              ELI
                    I'll be back.
          
          Eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.
          
                              ELI
                    If that battery ain't here when I
                    get back, I will use this gun on
                    your kneecaps and I will put this
                    building to the torch and I will
                    watch it burn to the ground with
                    you alive inside it. So help me
                    God.
          
          And with that he turns and leaves. The engineer gulps. Not a
          hint in Eli's voice that he didn't mean every word.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          This old second-floor DRESSING ROOM has been converted into a
          bedroom, simply furnished.
          
                                                                   27.
          
          
          A WOMAN stands in front of an old DRESSING ROOM MIRROR, the
          bulbs around the frame burned-out and broken. She washes her
          face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser.
          
          Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the
          mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped
          it's near impossible to see a reflection.
          
          The door opens and Carnegie enters. He still looks steamed.
          Claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Is that you, honey?
          
          Carnegie says nothing. Just paces angrily up and down.
          Finally Claudia turns to face him.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Something wrong?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    More books came in from the road
                    today.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Oh? It's been a while.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And it'll be a while longer. Just
                    another pile of useless junk. If we
                    don't find the right one soon - if
                    I can't give these people what they
                    want to hear...
          
          Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate.
          Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You'll find what you're looking
                    for. It's out there somewhere. You
                    just have to have faith.
          
          This seems to anger Carnegie. He wheels on her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Faith? Is that what you think we're
                    missing around here?
          
          She detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet,
          head bowed. Carnegie moves toward her angrily.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    My old man used to have faith. He
                    had it in spades. My mother, too.

                                                                    28.
          
                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    You know where it got them? You
                    know where it got me?
          
          He's in her face now. Claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Faith is for the weak. It's for
                    them out there, the sheep. This
                    world is what you can see and touch
                    and taste. It's what you make it.
                    All these years with me, you still
                    don't have any grasp of that?
                    What's wrong with you, woman?
          
          He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.
          
                                 CLAUDIA
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Carnegie realizes he's frightened her. He softens.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
                    scare you. Hey. You okay?
          
          He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You just get me all riled up with
                    that kind of talk. It's not what I
                    need from you right now.
                        (SMILES)
                    You know what I need right now?
          
          He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in
          the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of
          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.
          
          As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          The original customers have now been joined by the four
          bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and
          pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.
          
          Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him
          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.
          
          The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Outlander? Let me see-
          
                                                                 29.
          
          
          Eli raises his hand as before. Holds it outstretched, steady.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What'll it be?
          
          Eli places the canteen on the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    Water.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That's the good stuff. Gotta eat
                    into my own ration to sell it - so
                    I don't sell it cheap.
          
          Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender
          takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That'll get you maybe half-way.
          
          The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What about that?
          
          Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for
          sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
          pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    That's the best I got.
          
          The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat
          leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts
          with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.
          
          Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the
          biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.
          
          Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along
          with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Solara!
          
          A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17.
          Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair
          tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's
          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
          
          The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara
          along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Take this out back and get it
                    filled.
          
          Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up
          and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.
          There's something about him she can't put her finger on...
          
          He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Solara exits via the Palladium's STAGE DOOR and walks across
          the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIE'S ARMED MEN stand
          guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH
          RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.
          
          One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the
          front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card
          and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.
          
          Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging
          from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a
          few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak
          trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
          
          As Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms
          large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting
          a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.
          
          Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's
          canteen away into the back room.
          
                              HOG
                    That was my cat.
          
          Eli doesn't turn. Just looks straight ahead. Impossible to
          read him behind those mirrored goggles. Utterly inscrutable.
          
                              ELI
                    Fine specimen.
          
                              HOG
                    I saw you push him off the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    I didn't push him.
          
                              HOG
                    You raised your hand at him.
          
                                                                 31.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Sorry. It won't happen again.
          
          The bartender looks at Hog nervously.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Hey, how about another drink, Hog?
          
                              HOG
                    That cat's been comin' in here for
                    nigh on two years. It got more
                    right to be here than you. Who the
                    fuck do you think you are?
          
                              ELI
                    I don't want any trouble.
          
          Hog grabs him by the arm.
          
                              HOG
                    Well, that's too bad, `cause-
          
          Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing
          more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
          his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.
          
                              ELI
                    I know you. Murderer of innocent
                    travelers on the road. You're going
                    to spend eternity drowning in a
                    lake of fire for the things that
                    you've done. Did you know that?
          
          The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS
          following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.
          
                              ELI
                    You go on back to your table and
                    I'll be on my way. All right?
          
          It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases
          his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.
          
          Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and
          other patrons have moved to block his exit.
          
                              BURLY PATRON
                    You push Hog, you push all of us.
          
          Eli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time
          too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Cursed be the ground because of
                    you. By toil shall you eat of it.
                    Thorns and thistles shall it sprout
                    for you. From the ground were you
                    taken. For dust you are.
          
          The patrons look at Eli strangely. Who is this guy?
          
          Eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. Carves a line
          in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade.
          
                              ELI
                    And to dust you shall return.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants
          bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at
          her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.
          
          Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as
          Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply
          uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.
          
          Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S. Carnegie stops and listens.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did you hear that? What was that?
          
          Claudia sees an opening to get out of this.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Maybe you should go check.
          
          BEAT. Carnegie keeps listening. Then comes another CRASH.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What in the hell is going on?
          
          He pulls up his pants, grabbing a RIFLE propped by the door
          as he rushes out. Claudia just stands there for a moment,
          then reaches down and pulls up her panties.
          
          She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room,
          feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness.
          Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. Looks
          down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees.
          
                                                                 33.
          
          
          CHAOS in the bar below. Eli cutting a one-man swath of mayhem
          through the dozen brawlers. Most already lie dead. TWO MORE
          MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword.
          
          Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly
          on the doors of the upstairs rooms.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Get your asses out here!
          
          ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing.
          Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword
          held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.
          
          SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled
          canteen. She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees
          the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.
          
          She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless,
          terrified Hog, going in for the kill. Raising his sword...
          
          Suddenly, Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT:
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Stop!
          
          Eli FREEZES. Sword hanging in the air, poised to strike. He
          turns his head to where Solara stands behind the bar.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Please don't.
          
          BEAT as Eli considers. He looks back at Hog, still completely
          at his mercy... and then LOWERS THE SWORD.
          
                                 ELI
                    Go.
          
                              HOG
                        (CONFUSED)
                    ...What?
          
                              ELI
                    It ain't for me to judge you. Your
                    time for that's gonna come. Believe
                    me. Now go on. Get out of here.
          
          Hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight.
          Eli moves toward Solara, who stands petrified behind the bar.
          Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.
          
                                 ELI
                    Thank you.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          In the exitway, Hog turns back inside, grabbing up a BROKEN
          BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.
          
          Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes
          to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his
          sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.
          
          BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen
          in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.
          
          He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.
          
          Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at
          the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry for all the mess.
          
          As he turns and heads toward the door:
          
                              CARNEGIE (O.S.)
                    Hold it right there.
          
          Accompanied by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING.
          
          Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli.
          Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie sits at his desk, the huge auditorium and stage area
          visible behind him. Eli stands before him. Around him are the
          other gunmen, who keep their weapons trained on him.
          
          Standing at Carnegie's side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So, who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    Nobody. A walker in the outland.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I've met walkers before. Not a
                    particularly civilized bunch. Some
                    have even taken to eating their own
                    kind, did you know that? You
                    wouldn't be one of those savages
                    now, would you?
          
          Carnegie's gunmen look him over, inspecting him warily.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN
                    He ain't got the shakes.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          Carnegie's confident gaze remains fixed on Eli throughout.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Good. This is a civilized town.
                    Under God. Do you know what that
                    means?
          
          Eli can't help but react at the mention of that word.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It means we have laws here. Laws
                    set down long before any of us ever
                    walked this earth. And one of them
                    is, you don't eat the flesh of your
                    brother. Else you're no better than
                    an animal. And not welcome here.
          
          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So what's your business here,
                    friend? Walkers don't usually come
                    into town less they want something.
          
                              ELI
                    I had a battery needed charging and
                    a canteen needed filling. I didn't
                    come here looking for trouble.
          
          Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen,
          who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, you sure as hell found it. Do
                    you know who I am?
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    My name's Carnegie. I own this bar.
                    I own the whole town. You've never
                    heard of me?
          
                              ELI
                    That's you out there on the street.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
                    You'd never guess half the men who
                    built it were blind. A small
                    tribute from a grateful people. I
                    was deeply touched.
          
                                                                 36.
          
          
                              ELI
                    You had slaves build you a monument
                    to yourself?
          
          The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around
          the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Don't call them slaves. That's an
                    old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm
                    trying to help these people.
          
          Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural
          element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the outland the sightless are
                    preyed upon like sick animals. Here
                    at least they're protected. They do
                    the essential work others don't
                    want. And in return they eat, they
                    drink, they survive. Last year, a
                    couple of them even got married -
                    performed the ceremony myself.
                        (BEAT)
                    You see, I'm not exploiting these
                    people - I'm saving them! Any one
                    of them is free to leave whenever
                    they wish. But here they stay. And
                    they thank me every single day for
                    their salvation!
          
          An impressive, impassioned performance. He sounds just like
          an old-school TV evangelist. But Eli is unmoved.
          
                              ELI
                    It's none of my business what you
                    do here. Like you said, it's your
                    town. I just want to be on my way.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What's your name, walker?
          
          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    All right, I guess we just call you
                    Walker. Don't see too many folks
                    your age these days. You lived in
                    the world before? You can read?
          
                              ELI
                    I read every day.
          
                                                37.
          
          
                    CARNEGIE
          That's good. Good man. We educated
          folk, we need to stick together, if
          we're ever going to rebuild this
          world. People like you and me,
          we're the future.
          
                    ELI
          What do you want with me?
          
                     CARNEGIE
          Straight to the point. I like that.
          Fact is, you could be in a lot of
          trouble. This is a peaceful town.
          You walk in here, armed, and the
          next thing a dozen of my good
          citizens are dead. I've hanged men
          for less. I could hang you.
              (BEAT)
          Or, you could come work for me.
          
                    ELI
          What?
          
                    CARNEGIE
          I never once saw anyone handle
          themselves the way you did down
          there in that bar. I don't know
          where you learned it, but I sure as
          hell could use it.
          
                    ELI
          I'm not interested.
          
                    CARNEGIE
          People who work for me can live
          better than any walker ever
          dreamed. Real beds, clean water,
          hot food. Women, even. You could do
          a lot worse, my friend.
          
                    ELI
          I'm not your friend. And I'm not
          staying. I got someplace I need to
          be. Out west.
          
                    CARNEGIE
          West? There is nothing west. It's
          all gone, a long time ago.
          
                    ELI
          I've been told different.
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    By who?
          
          Eli doesn't reply. Carnegie smiles, dials up the charm.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    All right, look. I'm going to make
                    you an offer of goodwill. Stay the
                    night, think it over. Try a little
                    local hospitality. We'll talk again
                    in the morning. If you're still not
                    interested, you're free to go. No
                    hard feelings.
          
                              ELI
                    Thank you for your offer. But I'd
                    prefer to just leave right now. So
                    you can either let me out of here,
                    or I can kill my way out.
          
          The gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks. Carnegie appears
          unfazed. He smiles. BEAT. He looks to the gunman at the door.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Let him go.
          
          The gunman opens the door. Eli turns and exits.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
          
          The engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. His
          heart sinks when he sees Eli enter.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Oh, shit...
          
                              ELI
                    How's my battery?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's, uh... it's gonna take a
                    little longer than I thought.
          
                              ELI
                    How much longer?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's gotta charge overnight. You,
                    uh, you can always stay here in
                    town, pick it up in the morning.
          
          Eli leans in a little closer. He smells a rat.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
                              ELI
                    You remember what I said would
                    happen if I came back here and you
                    didn't have my battery?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's right here! It's just gonna
                    take a while longer. I swear.
          
          Eli looks at the engineer. Hard to be certain, but he's
          pretty sure he's lying. Somebody got to him.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          A VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall. Suddenly one
          of Carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is THROWN
          HARD INTO A WALL and slumps to the floor, unconscious.
          
          Eli storms into the box, pissed. MORE GUARDS rush in behind
          him. Carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off
          as he stands to greet Eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I knew you'd reconsider.
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah? How'd you know that?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    None of the walkers I've seen come
                    here from the outland were ever
                    what you'd call smart. I mean all
                    those years out there alone on the
                    road, some with their brains half-
                    fried from eating each other - it's
                    understandable why you people
                    aren't the brightest bulbs in the
                    box. But I never met one so dumb
                    that he'd turn down a meal and a
                    bed if it was offered.
          
                              ELI
                    So you didn't send someone across
                    the street to the engineer?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Engineer? I don't know what you're
                    talking about. If there's something
                    wrong, maybe I can help.
          
          Carnegie is a practiced liar. Much more difficult to read.
          
                                                                 40.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    This is Redridge. He's kind of my
                    right-hand man around here.
          
          Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room -
          steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He'll show you to your room.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSK
          
          Redridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside.
          
          It's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom,
          less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug.
          Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Enjoy your stay. There'll be
                    someone outside your room all
                    night. If you need anything.
          
          Redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli
          paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old
          bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.
          
          He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed.
          It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.
          
          A KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet.
          
                              ELI
                    Hello?
          
          The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of
          water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I have this for you. Water for
                    washing and some food.
          
          Eli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of
          situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well... are you going to take it?
          
                              ELI
                    Oh. Thank you.
          
          He takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.
          
                                                                 41.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You're very welcome.
          
          We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this
          kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    It'll be dark soon.
          
          She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The
          room is lit by its flickering glow.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Can I get you anything else?
          
                              ELI
                    No, thank you.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well. Have a good night.
          
          As she turns for the door:
          
                              ELI
                    You're Carnegie's woman?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Why do you ask?
          
                              ELI
                    Just making conversation is all.
                    Haven't had one of those in a
                    while. Not a real one, leastways.
          
          Claudia smiles. Neither has she.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    He found me in the outland. I was
                    sixteen, my family had been...
                    well, they were gone. There was
                    just me and my baby.
          
                              ELI
                    You had a baby?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I'd met some men on the road. Bad
                    men. They...
          
          BEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory.
          Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.
          
                              ELI
                    It's all right.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I was on the road for a year after
                    that. I couldn't feed myself, let
                    alone my little girl. And then Bill
                    found us and he promised he'd take
                    care of us. He told me he was going
                    to make a place where we could be
                    safe. And he did. He did all that.
                    He built this whole town. He kept
                    us safe. And he raised that child
                    like she was his own. He's been so
                    good to both of us. He saved us,
                    really.
          
          There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though
          there is more to the story than she is telling.
          
          Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to eat some?
          
          She smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her.
          
                              ELI
                    When did you go blind? In the war?
                    You get caught in a flash?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    No, I was born this way. I think
                    I'm lucky like that.
          
                              ELI
                    Lucky?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    It's not like I ever knew what I'm
                    missing. I was already used to
                    being like this by the time... by
                    the time it all happened. So I got
                    around pretty good even when I was
                    on my own. And now it's easy. I
                    know every creaky old floorboard in
                    here, and it's not like I ever go
                    any place else. Bill would never
                    allow it. He worries about me so
                    much.
          
          Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.
          Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I should go. He'll be wondering
                    where I am.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Thank you. I enjoyed our
                    conversation.
          
                                ELI
                    So did I.
          
          Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room
          mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You took your time in there. How
                    long does it take to deliver a
                    plate of food and some water?
          
          A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    He wanted to talk.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Oh? What about?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Nothing really. He asked me what it
                    was like to be blind.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He tell you anything about him?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    No. I don't think he likes to talk
                    about himself much.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Yeah, I got that.
          
          Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I don't think he's going to change
                    his mind by morning. I don't think
                    he's going to stay.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What makes you say that?
          
                                                                44.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Just strikes me as the kind of man
                    who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
                    seem like the type to go changing
                    it once it's set.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, we'll just see about that.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You saw him. He's not like the
                    others. You won't be able to smooth-
                    talk him and wrap him around your
                    finger like you usually do.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Who said anything about me?
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm sending Solara.
          
          Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You're doing what?
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know how often these walkers
                    get laid? Never. Least not by
                    anything living or willing. Girl
                    like her can be very persuasive.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You can't send her in there with
                    him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You went in there readily enough.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    That's different. Solara's just a
                    child, she can't-
          
          Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    She's a grown woman now, Claudia.
                    Sooner or later you're going to
                    have to accept that. She has to
                    earn her keep around here, same as
                    the rest of us.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    By working as a whore? That's all
                    you think she's fit for?
          
                                                                    45.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    We've each been given a talent to
                    help us make our way in this world.
                    Some people's gift is more evident
                    than others. Solara's sure as hell
                    is.
          
          Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What kind of a man are you?
          
          Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her
          menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I'm the kind of man who'd pull a
                    helpless blind girl off the road, a
                    girl who'd been beaten and raped,
                    and give her a place where she can
                    live without fear! Without me you'd
                    be just another no-eye, lying dead
                    in the outland, picked clean by the
                    buzzards, or shoveling dirt down
                    there with the others. That's the
                    kind of man I am!
          
          He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I don't live without fear. I
                    haven't for a long time now.
          
          Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Where are you going?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I'm not going to let you do this.
          
          Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    You're not going to let me?
                        (BEAT)
                    Nobody tells me what I can and
                    can't do in my own town. Nobody. I
                    built this world, and I am God
                    here! So don't go thinking about
                    screwing with my plans. You know
                    how this works. Solara goes against
                    me, you get hurt. You go against
                    me, she gets hurt.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
          He releases his grip on her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So let's not see anybody get hurt.
                    Okay?
          
          He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly
          through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
          oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old
          leather-bound book from his backpack.
          
          Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
          the book inside his shirt.
          
                               ELI
                    Come in.
          
          The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than
          she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
          dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.
          
          Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at
          least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far
          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Hi. Can I come in?
          
                              ELI
                    Someone was already here with food
                    and water. I got everything I need.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You sure about that?
          
          She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very
          seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's too bright in here. Mind if I
                    turn it down a little?
          
          She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns
          down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's better. I'm Solara. You're
                    Walker, right?
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
                              ELI
                    No. My name's Eli.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That short for something? Elias?
          
                               ELI
                    Elijah.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Elijah. I never heard that one
                    before. It's kinda cute.
          
          She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light
          cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The
          silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
          oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.
          
                              ELI
                    Look, I don't mean to be rude. But
                    I'm really not interested.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You sure about that? It gets mighty
                    lonely out there on the road.
          
          She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair
          cascades down. God damn, she looks good.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If you're worried about money, this
                    is all paid for. The whole night.
          
                              ELI
                    It's not that. You're a very nice
                    girl. But I'm not that kind of man.
          
          She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the
          buttons of his shirt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They're all that kind of man.
          He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.
          
                               ELI
                    I'm not.
          
          She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And
          then she seems a little insulted.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They told me you were crazy. Maybe
                    they were right.
          
                                                                 48.
          
          
          Eli opens the door for her.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. Good night.
          
          Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves
          to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Please don't make me leave. I have
                    to stay the night. If I don't...
          
                              ELI
                    If you don't, what?
          
                              SOLARA
                    He'll hurt my mom.
          
                              ELI
                    Who will? Carnegie?
          
          She nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli.
          
                              ELI
                    Maybe he and I oughta have words.
          
          He goes for the door handle, but she stops him.
          
                              SOLARA
                    No! Please, don't!
          
                              ELI
                    He's hurting you. He's hurting your
                    mother. He's-
          
                              SOLARA
                    He's my dad.
          
          BEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Look, if you want to help me, just
                    let me stay here tonight. We don't
                    have to do anything. I'll sleep on
                    the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my
                    dad that we had a good time. I'll
                    be no trouble, I swear.
          
          She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the
          teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to have a conversation?
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          She smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.
          
          LATER
          
          Eli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At
          first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.
          
                                ELI
                      You know, you don't have to be
                      afraid of me. What happened down
                      there in the bar...
          
                                SOLARA
                      I'm not afraid of you. I know you
                      didn't start that trouble. When I
                      first saw you, I knew you weren't
                      the type to go looking for it.
          
                                ELI
                      How'd you know that?
          
                                 SOLARA
                      My mom says I'm a good judge of
                      character. She says I can read
                      people. That I know a good man when
                      I see one.
          
          She smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back.
          
                                SOLARA
                      So... you're pretty old, right?
          
          Eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.
          
                                SOLARA
                      I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't
                      seen too many people your age. How
                      old are you exactly?
          
                                ELI
                      You know, I don't rightly remember.
          
                                SOLARA
                      But you're old enough. I mean, you
                      remember what it was like? In the
                      world before?
          
          Eli nods.
          
                                SOLARA
                      What was it like?
          
          Eli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories.
          
                                                                    50.
          
          
                               ELI
                    Better than this.
                        (BEAT)
                    People lived longer back then.
                    Longer than me. Some were more than
                    a hundred years old.
          
          Solara smiles like she's having her leg pulled.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Come on.
          
                              ELI
                    I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's
                    not the same. If you're sick or
                    you're weak or you're old you won't
                    last long out on the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So how come you have?
          
          BEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he?
          
                              ELI
                    Can I read you something?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Wait. You can read?
          
          Eli pulls the book from his shirt. Solara's eyes widen.
          
                              SOLARA
                    And you have a book?
                              ELI
                    Not just any book.
          
          For the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An
          embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.
          
          Eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he
          finds the passage he's looking for.
          
                              ELI
                    The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
                    not want. He makes me lie down in
                    green pastures. He leads me beside
                    still waters. He restores my soul.
                    He leads me in the paths of
                    righteousness.
          
          ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read. Transfixed.
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Though I walk through the valley of
                    the shadow of death, I will fear no
                    evil. For you are with me. Your rod
                    and your staff, they comfort me.
                    You prepare a table before me in
                    the presence of my enemies. You
                    anoint my head with oil. My cup
                    runs over. Surely goodness and
                    mercy shall follow me, all the days
                    of my life. And I will dwell in the
                    house of the Lord forever.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's beautiful. Did you write
                    that?
          
                                ELI
                          (SMILES)
                    No.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What book is it from? Is it poetry?
          
                              ELI
                    I guess you could think of it that
                    way. It's from the Holy Bible.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never heard of it. What's it
                    about?
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks. How on earth to answer that?
          
                              ELI
                    It's about love, and forgiveness,
                    and life and death, and mercy, and
                    revenge, and the beginning and the
                    end of the world. I guess it's
                    about a little bit of everything.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Can I see?
          
          She reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What? I'm not going to do anything.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect
                    this book. I can't trust it with
                    anyone. Not even for a while.
          
                                                                 52.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's so special about that book?
          
          BEAT. Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on
          the beat-up leather cover.
          
                              ELI
                    It's the last one. There are no
                    other books like this. All the
                    others are gone - destroyed by the
                    war or in the burnings that came
                    after. This is the only one that
                    survived until now. The last one
                    anywhere.
          
                              SOLARA
                    How can you know that?
          
                               ELI
                    I just know.
                        (BEAT)
                    For a long while after it happened,
                    I just wandered on the road like
                    most everybody else. There were
                    still a lot of people around back
                    then, in the beginning. I didn't
                    really know what I should do or
                    where I was going. I was just
                    moving from place to place, trying
                    to stay alive. And then one day I
                    heard this voice. I don't know how
                    to explain it, it's like it was
                    coming from inside me. But I could
                    hear it, clear as day. Clear as I
                    can hear you talking to me now.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What did it say?
          
                              ELI
                    It led me to this place, I don't
                    really know where. And I found this
                    book buried deep under some rubble.
                    No way no-one was ever going to
                    find it if they didn't know exactly
                    where to look.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But you knew because the voice told
                    you?
          
                              ELI
                    That's right. And that voice told
                    me to carry the book west.

                               ELI (cont'd)
                    It told me that a path would be
                    laid out before me, that I'd be led
                    to a place where this book would be
                    safe. It told me I'd be protected
                    against anyone or anything that
                    tried to stand in my way. If only I
                    would have faith.

                              SOLARA
                        (SKEPTICAL)
                    Because a voice you heard in your
                    head told you to.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it.
                    I know what I heard.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So who was it? The voice?
          
          BEAT as Eli considers his answer.
          
                              ELI
                    A very important, very powerful
                    man.
          
                              SOLARA
                    More powerful than my dad?
          
                              ELI
                        (SMILES)
                    I should say so, yes.
          
          BEAT. The two of them sit in silence for a moment.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Would you teach me to read?
          
                              ELI
                    What?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never learned. No-one around here
                    knows how. Only my dad, and he
                    won't teach me. I think he likes
                    being the only one who can read. I
                    think it makes him feel powerful.
          
                              ELI
                    I think you're probably right.

                              SOLARA
                    So would you teach me?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.
                    And I won't be back this way, ever.
          
          She looks down, sad. She likes this guy. She doesn't want him
          to leave. Eli can sense her sadness.

                              SOLARA
                    I guess a little.
          
                              ELI
                    There's some food on the table over
                    there. Let's eat.
          
          She walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small
          cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling on a
          piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away.
          
          The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's
          shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.
          
                              ELI
                    It's okay, it's okay. He's with me.
                        (to the rat)
                    Don't be afraid, pal. This is
                    Solara. She's our friend.
          
          Solara approaches warily. Reaches out and strokes him. The
          rat scurries up her arm. She almost shrieks again.
          
                              ELI
                    It's okay. It means he likes you.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    It does?
                              ELI
                    Trust me, if he didn't like you,
                    you'd know about it.
          
          Solara pets the rat on her shoulder. Then:
          
                              SOLARA
                    Did you really mean that?
          
                                 ELI
                    Mean what?
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    That I'm your friend.
          
          BEAT. Eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a
          thing. When is the last time he had someone he could call a
          friend? He can't even remember.
          
                              ELI
                    Sure.
          
          She smiles. Giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear.
          
          Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. She's
          about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.
          
                              ELI
                    Our father, we thank you for this
                    meal which you have been so
                    gracious to place before us.
          
          Unsure of what to do, Solara mimics Eli, putting her hands
          together and bowing her head.
          
                               ELI
                    We thank you for a warm bed and a
                    roof over our heads on a cold night
                    such as this.
                        (BEAT)
                    And we thank you for the gift of
                    friendship in these hard times.
          
          Solara looks at him, touched by that.
          
                               ELI
                    Amen.
                        (BEAT)
                    You say that last part too.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Amen. And now we eat?
          
                              ELI
                    And now we eat.
          
          They sit and eat together, sharing the simple meal.
          
          PULL OUT from the window as they eat, away from the theater.
          Away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight.
          Moving farther and farther away until the entire town is
          consumed by the darkness of the world.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAWN
          
          The pale sun rises over the town. To establish:
          
                                                                    56.
          
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - MORNING
          
          What was once the theater's COSTUME ROOM - OLD MANNEQUINS
          still stand around in the corners, creating an eerie feel.
          
          Carnegie and Claudia sit at a DINING TABLE, eating breakfast
          in silence. A third place is set, but no-one is seated there.
          
          Solara enters and sits down without a word.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Good morning, Solara.
          
          Solara doesn't say anything.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I said good morning, Solara.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Morning, dad.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    How was your night? Did you sleep
                    well?
          
          Claudia appears perturbed by Carnegie's subtle probing.
          Solara flashes him a frosty look.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I did like you asked. Isn't that
                    what you really want to know? Just
                    come out and say it.
          
          Carnegie glares at her sternly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You don't speak to your father like
                    that. When I ask you a civil
                    question, I expect a civil answer.
          
          Solara lowers her head, scorned. Carnegie continues eating.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did he say anything?
          
                              SOLARA
                    No. We didn't talk much.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, do you think you managed to
                    change his mind about staying?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't know. He said he had to go.
          
                                                                 57.
          
          
          Carnegie puts down his food, looks angrily at her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So he did talk? What else did he
                    say? Come on, I want all of it!
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's all he said. That he was
                    going to be leaving this morning.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    We'll see. This is my town, nobody
                    leaves until I say they leave.
          
          He glances knowingly at Claudia.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Solara, honey, eat something.
          
          She looks at the food on the plate before her. Then closes
          her eyes and clasps her hands in prayer.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Our father, thank you for this meal
                    which you have been so gracious to
                    place before us.
          
          Claudia and Carnegie freeze. Carnegie stares at her, agape.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you for my mother. Please
                    watch over her and keep her safe.
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    Solara...
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you for all the-
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    Solara!
          She snaps suddenly out of it, looks at her father.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
          She doesn't respond. Looks embarrassed.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    God didn't put this food on the
                    table. Do you hear me?
                        (BEAT)
                    Who put this food on the table?
          
                                                                 58.
          
          
          Solara says nothing, just looks down at the table.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I said who put this food on the
                    table?
          
                              SOLARA
                        (SOFTLY)
                    You did.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Who taught you that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Eli taught me.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                        (PUZZLED)
                    Who the hell is Eli?
          
                              SOLARA
                    The walker. That's his name.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And he taught you how to say those
                    words? How did he know them?
          
                              SOLARA
                    He had them written down in a book.
          
          This piques Carnegie's interest greatly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What kind of a book?
          
          He barks the question at her. Solara is rattled.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't remember! It was an old
                    leather book. It had kind of a...
                    thing on the front of it.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Show me.
          
          Solara makes the SIGN OF A CRUCIFIX with her index fingers.
          Carnegie's eyes widen; he can barely believe it.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He had a bible?
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's what it was. A holy bible.
                    Daddy, what's wrong? Did I...
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Carnegie BOLTS SUDDENLY FROM THE TABLE, overturning his chair
          and sending his plate of food crashing to the floor.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - LOBBY BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie races across the landing, toward the ARMED GUARD
          posted outside Eli's bedroom. The guard steps aside as
          Carnegie flings the door open and barges inside.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Empty. No sign of Eli or his gear anywhere. The window is
          WIDE OPEN, the curtains fluttering gently in the breeze.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          His hands shaking, the engineer disconnects Eli's battery
          from the generator and places it on the counter.
          
          Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOTGUN
          TRAINED RIGHT AT THE MAN'S HEAD. He takes the battery from
          him and stuffs it into his backpack.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie races from the lobby entrance and looks up at the
          open window to Eli's room. He could have easily jumped.
          
          Redridge emerges onto the street behind him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Something wrong, boss?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Something wrong? Something wrong?
                    The walker's gone!
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    That can't be. I had a man outside
                    his room the whole time.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He jumped out the window, you
                    idiot! You didn't think to put a
                    man outside the fucking window?
                        (beat; fuming)
                    Find him. Now!
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Boss, he could be anywhere. He...
                        (REALIZATION)
                    A battery. Didn't he say something
                    about a battery?
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
          They turn to face the engineer's storefront - just as ELI
          EMERGES ONTO THE STREET, shotgun still in his hand.
          
          EVERYBODY FREEZES. Like a wild west stand-off. Redridge's
          fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip.
          
          BEAT as time hangs perfectly still for a second... and then
          ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
          
          Redridge draws and FIRES, SHATTERING A PARKING METER just
          inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the sidewalk.
          
          Eli rushes along the sidewalk, RETURNING FIRE. The shot wings
          Redridge in the shoulder. He goes down, wounded.
          
          Carnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from the
          theater. Carnegie waves frantically in Eli's direction.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Go! Go!
          
          They spot Eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit.
          
          Carnegie gets to his feet and storms back inside the theater.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Solara and Claudia watch through the window. Turn suddenly
          when they hear the door slam open behind them.
          
          Carnegie stands in the doorway, glaring at them.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          LOCAL RESIDENTS scream and rush to and fro in panic as Eli
          darts along the boardwalk.
          
          CARNEGIE'S GUNMEN pursue, firing their rifles wildly on the
          run. The bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates,
          narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down.
          
          Eli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking. The shot
          HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST, dropping him to the dirt.
          
          Eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as more
          gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to
          collect himself, reloads the shotgun.
          
          The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily.
          
          Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the
          sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around
          the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN
          FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.
          
                                                                 61.
          
          
          In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Three
          shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smoke
          wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.
          
          The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in
          the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their
          heads remaining.
          
          Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the
          perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free.
          
          And then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable.
          
          Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater,
          Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking
          angrily at her, shaking her.
          
          Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to
          the road again.
          
                              ELI
                        (quietly; to himself)
                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path.
          
          But he sounds less resolute now than before. Until today this
          was always a simple decision for him to make. But now...
          
                                ELI
                    Dammit...
          
          He marches back toward the theater, stepping over the fallen
          bodies of the gunmen, re-loading his shotgun as he goes.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet,
          wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound.
          
          He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him.
          Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw
          with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli kicks the door wide open, finds Carnegie holding Solara
          against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the shotgun
          at Carnegie's head.
          
                              ELI
                    Let her go.
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    That cannon of yours casts a pretty
                    wide net. I don't reckon you can
                    hit me without hitting her.
          
                              ELI
                    I reckon you're right.
          
          He holsters the shotgun. Then in the same fluid motion draws
          a PISTOL from his belt that we never even knew he had.
          
                              ELI
                    This, though? With this I'll shave
                    the hairs clean off your balls at a
                    hundred paces. You believe me?
          
          Carnegie releases his grip on Solara, steps away, hands up.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I believe you. I have to say I'm
                    surprised to hear that language
                    coming from you, though. I mean,
                    you being a holy man and all.
          
          BEAT. Eli glances at Solara.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    She told me all about it. Told me
                    all about the bible, too.
                        (BEAT)
                    Can I see it?
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
          Carnegie takes a small step forward. Suddenly, his whole
          demeanor changes, and he now looks at Eli imploringly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know, I've been searching for a
                    book like that one for years. All
                    I've ever wanted was to bring the
                    word of God to these poor
                    unfortunates here. To shine its
                    light upon them and give them
                    something in this wretched world
                    that they could believe in.
                    Something to live for! It's why I
                    built this town, did you know that?
                    All we've been missing is the word
                    to show us the way. And now, praise
                    the Lord, you've brought it to us.
          
                                                                 63.
          
          
          Carnegie takes a step closer. He appears entirely sincere -
          but then he is very good at doing so.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It's not right to keep that book
                    hidden away, all to yourself. The
                    word is meant to be shared with
                    others. It's meant to be spread!
                    Isn't that what you want? I could
                    help you do that. You and me, we
                    could do it together.
          
          BEAT. Eli seems to be considering what he's heard carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    The Lord himself told me that if I
                    carried this book west, one day I
                    would find the place where it was
                    needed. Where it would be safe.
                    Where it belonged.
          
          Carnegie smiles broadly... and then with a sudden blur of
          movement Eli PISTOL-WHIPS him to the floor.
          
                              ELI
                    But this ain't it.
          
          He turns to Solara and offers her his hand.
          
                               ELI
                    Come on.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli emerges from the theater, leading Solara onto the street.
          RESIDENTS part before them, staring at Eli with astonishment.
          
          Eli passes the statue of Carnegie - and STOPS. Something
          about that thing is bothering him.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What? What is it?
          
                              ELI
                    You shall not make for yourself any
                    graven image...
          
          He turns, drawing his samurai sword and in the same fluid
          motion SLICING across the base of the statue.
          
          BEAT. And then the STATUE TOPPLES from the neat cut just
          below the knees, CRASHING DOWN to the ground and SHATTERING.
          The assembled residents GASP at this defiant display.
          
                                                                    64.
          
          
          Eli sheathes his sword and takes Solara by the hand again.
          
                              ELI
                    Now we can go.
          
          CRANE UP over the main street as they both head out of town.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          The town barely visible on the distant horizon behind Eli and
          Solara. Eli walks as he always has, his pace steady and slow.
          Still, Solara lags along behind. She's already tired.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where are we going?
          
                              ELI
                    I told you where I'm going. You're
                    free to go wherever you want.
          
          She stops in the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Wait... I'm not coming with you?
          
                              ELI
                    You're only going to slow me down.
          
          Eli doesn't stop walking. Solara is forced to catch up.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So what the hell was all that about
                    back there?
          
                              ELI
                    The man was hurting you. I don't
                    like that, so I put a stop to it.
                    Now you're free. He can't hurt you
                    any more.
                        (off her stare)
                    No need to thank me.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you? For what? What am I
                    supposed to do now?
          
                              ELI
                    Whatever you want. That's what
                    being free is.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Whatever I want. Except go with
                    you.
          
                                                                   65.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I have to get where I'm going. I
                    can't be worrying about someone
                    else along the way.
          
          Solara is incredibly hurt by this. Blinks back a tear.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I thought you were my friend.
          
          BEAT. Eli stops and turns back to face her.
          
                              ELI
                    It's dangerous in the outland. I
                    wouldn't want you to get hurt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I'll be safe so long as I'm with
                    you. I know it.
          
          Eli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes the
          harsh truth of it:
          
                              ELI
                    You don't want this life. I gotta
                    do what I gotta do. Don't have no
                    choice in it. But you do. And I
                    can't let you choose this. You
                    don't want to be like me. You don't
                    want to spend your life alone.
          
          Solara steps closer, her eyes pleading.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If I came with you, I wouldn't be
                    alone. And neither would you.
          
          A long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appears as
          though Solara might have won him over. But then:
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best
                    you just go on back to town.
          
          He turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. She stands
          there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Fine! I'll do just that! I had a
                    life there! A family! I didn't ask
                    you to save me! I didn't ask you
                    for anything!
          
                                                                 66.
          
          
          He doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. Just keeps walking
          off into the horizon. Getting smaller all the time.
          
          Solara stands there in the road, weeping. All alone.
          
                              SOLARA
                        (SOFTLY)
                    Fine.
          
          She turns and walks back in the direction she came.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY
          
          A small, penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium
          containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. Goats,
          sheep, geese, pigs. Mostly mangy, sad-looking specimens.
          
          Carnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed
          from a nearby sack onto the ground. He watches with
          satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed.
          
          Claudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Thank you, darling.
          
          Carnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli's
          pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He killed four of my men and walked
                    out of town without a scratch. They
                    shot off a hundred rounds at him
                    and he didn't get hit once. I never
                    even heard of anything like that.
          
          Carnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a
          world of his own as he tends to the farm animals.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know, I always thought of
                    myself as a shepherd. Bringing
                    together the wayward and the lost.
                    Tending to my flock. But all the
                    things I want to do, I can't do
                    them on my own. The one thing I've
                    needed is the one thing that's
                    always been missing. Then one day
                    it walks right into town - so close
                    I can almost touch it - and then
                    walks right on out again.
          
          Carnegie finally looks up from his animals, at Redridge.
          
                                                                 67.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I want you to put a crew together
                    and go out after him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's not going to work for you. I
                    think he's made that plain.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I'm not interested in him any more.
                    I only want the book he's carrying.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting
                    down this maniac in the outland, I
                    need to know it's gonna be worth
                    it. I need to know what's so
                    special about this goddamn book.
          
          BEAT as Carnegie considers this.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You have no idea. You're too young,
                    you don't remember the world
                    before. But I do. I remember.
          
          He turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    When I was a kid my parents used to
                    read that book every goddamn day.
                    My mother, she'd read it along with
                    this smooth-talking preacher on the
                    TV screen. They used to be able to
                    beam these guys right into your
                    house, into every house in the
                    world, through the air. Like magic.
                        (BEAT)
                    She worked two jobs and she sent
                    every spare penny she had to that
                    fucking guy on the TV. My old man,
                    he'd read that book, then he'd get
                    liquored up and kick my ass, tell
                    me all about the power and the
                    glory and how I was going to burn
                    forever in hell for the sins I was
                    born with. He made sure he beat it
                    into me good.
          
          He snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Don't you see? It's not just any
                    book.

                    It has the power to motivate
                    people. It can give them hope, it
                    can terrify them. It can shape
                    them. Control them.

                    Do you remember how I built this
                    town? It wasn't done with force,
                    and it wasn't done just with water.
                    It was done with the power of
                    words. I created this place out of
                    nothing, because people believed in
                    a promise that I sold to them.
                    Those guys on the TV, they were
                    richer than you could ever dream,
                    and it was all built the same way.
                    With words. With promises. And with
                    that book.
                        (BEAT)
                    That book is a weapon. Aimed right
                    at the hearts and minds of the weak
                    and the desperate. Just imagine
                    what I could do with it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Boss... we're running out of water
                    and the people are running out of
                    patience. You're trying to tell me
                    that a book is going to keep them
                    in line?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Oh, it'll do much more than that.
                    The water in this town may run dry,
                    but faith - that springs eternal!
                    And that faith will help turn this
                    town into a city. And this city
                    into a nation. It will help me
                    build a new world. In my image.
                    People will come from far and wide
                    to hear what's inside of it.
                    They'll follow me anywhere just to
                    get a taste of it. And they'll do
                    whatever I tell them.
          
          As usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge has
          totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    And what if this book don't work?
                    What if it don't say what you want
                    it to say?
          
                                                                 69.
          
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Oh, it'll say what I want, I can
                    promise you that. Because I'm going
                    to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts
                    that work for me and make the rest
                    whatever I need it to be.
                        (BEAT)

          He reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What do you think, darling? A whole
                    new world, to do with as we will.
                    Won't that be grand?
          
          She smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified.
          
          Carnegie turns back to Redridge.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Find that book.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He has half a day on us already.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So use the motor pool.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    There ain't much gas in reserve.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Whatever there is, use it.
          
          Redridge nods and goes to leave.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What about Solara?
          
          BEAT. In all this excitement about the book, she had been
          completely forgotten about.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    She's still out there. With him.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Right. Right. Of course. Bring her
                    back, too, if you can. But-
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    The book. I know.
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          Redridge turns and leaves. Claudia scowls at Carnegie, but he
          doesn't even notice, just goes back to feeding his animals.
          
          EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY
          
          Solara wanders the road. She's tired. The sun beats down
          mercilessly. Nothing but desolation and wasteland all around.
          
          She comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD. Stops at the junction,
          unsure. Was this here before? She doesn't remember.
          
          There are no signs. Both paths look the same. Which one is
          which? She turns and looks back, looks around. She's lost.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Shit. Shit.
          
          She alternates her finger between the two paths. Eeny-meeny-
          miney-moe. Picks a path and follows it, headed down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli walks on. Slow and steady. His gaze, as ever, fixed
          firmly on the horizon. Takes a swig from his canteen.
          
          Suddenly, he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of
          the road. Impossible to know what he's thinking.
          
          He stands there for a long time.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - DAY
          
          Solara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION. She doesn't
          remember passing this. Looks back up and down the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where the hell am I?
          
          There's a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps. Like every
          other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine.
          
          She walks around to the driver's side. A PETRIFIED FEMALE
          BODY lies on the ground, half-in, half-out of the car.
          
          Solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified.
          
          In the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER.
          Solara hesitates. Not wanting to get closer. But so thirsty.
          
          She braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle,
          but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. She
          pulls harder and wrenches it free. In the process she falls
          on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          In the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to
          her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara.
          
          Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from
          it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt.
          
          She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall,
          hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together.
          
          She inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean.
          Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.
          
          She SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable.
          
          INT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAY
          
          Solara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty
          shelves coated in thick sheets of dust.
          
          She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But
          the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the
          wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.
          
          She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's
          beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic.
          
                              FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello?
          
          Distant, calling from outside. Solara hears it and freezes.
          
                              FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello? Can anyone help me?
          
          EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          She runs out across the forecourt, onto the road.
          
          A FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about
          fifty yards up ahead. Hard to see what she's doing from here.
          
                              SLUMPED FEMALE
                    Hello? Is anybody there?
          
          Solara starts walking toward her.
          
          The woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees,
          muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road.
          
          As Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling
          with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch,
          its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          We see her face now. It's the SAME YOUNG WOMAN from before.
          The same shopping cart. The same trap.
          
                                SOLARA
                      Are you all right?
          
          The woman looks around, sees Solara standing nearby. She's
          shocked to see that it's a girl.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You
                      go along, I'll be okay.
          
                                SOLARA
                      You look like you need some help.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      No, really! I'm fine. Really... I
                      need a man to help. Not you. You
                      just keep along. Please.
          
          The woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate
          the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it.
          
                                SOLARA
                      It'll just take a minute.
          
          She steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Really, it's fine! Please!
          
          Too   late. THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES. Every
          bit   as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli killed on
          the   road in our opening. They grab Solara and drag her from
          the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Let her go! She ain't got nothing!
          
          The BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully.
          
                                BRIGAND LEADER
                      I ain't too sure about that.
          
          Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench
          overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He
          licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      This wasn't the deal!
          
          The brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta
                    be grateful you're getting a break.
          
          He releases her. She slumps to the dirt, whimpering.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Never did care much for that dried-
                    up old snatch anyhow.
          
          He looks back to the struggling Solara.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    This one, though... this one looks
                    fresh. You a virgin?
          
          She says nothing, just sobs helplessly.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Well, let's find out.
          
          He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.
          
          We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.
          
          The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale,
          the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara
          look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.
          
          A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.
          
          There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down
          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood
          streams down his thighs. A real horror show.
          
          He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down
          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.
          
          The two other brigands release Solara and whip around,
          scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a
          RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.
          
          Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most
          terrifying thing either has ever seen.
          
          ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His
          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.
          
          He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
          trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.
          
          Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO
          THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft
          plugging the muzzle tight.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          Rifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS
          HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.
          
          Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his
          sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The
          two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.
          
          BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES
          ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the
          sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.
          
          The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His
          hand goes limp and drops the knife.
          
          And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost
          completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from
          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.
          
          Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
          on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their
          fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.
          
          He crouches down between them in the dust.
          
                              ELI
                    I offer you both one final chance
                    in this life to seek forgiveness
                    for your sins so that your souls
                    may find salvation. Will you say
                    with me the act of contrition?
          
          The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.
          
                                BRIGAND LEADER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.
          
                              ELI
                    Some might think it'd be most
                    fitting to leave you here like
                    this. Let you die slow in the sun.
                    But I know better. I know where
                    you're going. And the sooner you
                    get there, the sooner you'll get
                    what's coming to you.
          
          He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him
          off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.
          
          He turns to the other man, raising his sword.
          
                                RIFLE BANDIT
                    Wait!
          
                                                                   75.
          
          
          Eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.
          
                              RIFLE BANDIT
                    I want to say it. I want to be
                    forgiven.
          
          Eli crouches once more by his side.
          
                              ELI
                    Repeat after me. Oh God, I am
                    heartily sorry for having offended
                    thee, and I detest all my sins.
          
          The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words
          quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.
          
                              ELI
                    I firmly resolve, with the help of
                    thy grace, to confess my sins, and
                    do penance, and to amend my life.
                    Amen.
          
                              RIFLE BANDIT
                    Amen...
          
          His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. Dead. Eli
          signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away.
          
          Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches and
          gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You came back for me.
          
                              ELI
                    What are friends for?
          
          She laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. Grips him tighter.
          
          He helps her up and escorts her back to the road.
          
                              ELI
                    This is the deal. You keep up. You
                    pull your weight. You fall behind,
                    I can't help you. Okay?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Okay.
          
          She looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What about her?
          
                                                                    76.
          
          
                              ELI
                    There's nothing can be done for
                    her.
          
          They walk on down the road.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          METAL GARAGE DOORS roll back to reveal darkness within.
          
          A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.
          
          A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily
          modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its
          original form still recognizable underneath.
          
          It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer
          moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier.
          
          Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE
          GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.
          
          THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you
          could imagine. A MINI COOPER. FORD EXPLORER. A PRIUS. Each
          adorned with plate armor and weapons.
          
          In the lead Minivan is REDRIDGE, heavily armed. He nods to
          the DRIVER, who guns the engine.
          
          The fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great
          funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.
          
          EXT. DESERT - DAY
          
          Late afternoon. The sun hangs low on the horizon. We're far
          from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG
          BURROWS dotted around.
          
          A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing
          the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.
          
          Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears
          to COME ALIVE. And then we realize it is Eli's GHILLIE SUIT,
          camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.
          
          Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead
          prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You killed it! That cute little
                    thing!
          
          Eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.
          
                                                                    77.
          
          
                              ELI
                    It's good eating, is what it is.
          
          He yanks out the bloody arrow. Solara looks away.
          
          When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the
          dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise and
          staggers backward, falling on her butt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's not funny.
          
                              ELI
                    If you're going to be on the road,
                    you can't be picky about what you
                    eat. You eat what's there to eat.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I'm not eating that.
          
                              ELI
                        (SHRUGS)
                    More for me.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND CAVE - DUSK
          
          Eli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a
          flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.
          
          Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out
          clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down
          penitently at the ground.
          
                              ELI
                    Father, we thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us with
                    this meal. Bless this food to our
                    use and us to thy service, and keep
                    us ever mindful of the needs of
                    others. Amen.
          
          Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites
          into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it
          tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.
          
          Solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What does that taste like?
          
          He takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.
          
                              ELI
                    Tastes like chicken.
          
                                                                 78.
          
          
          She tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't.
          She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a
          small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles.
          
          As she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What is that?
          
          Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.
          
                              ELI
                    It's a Saint Christopher medal.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a
                    character from your book?
          
          Eli smiles and shakes his head.
          
                              ELI
                    Christopher was a man who lived a
                    long time ago. He wanted to be a
                    good man, he wanted to help people.
                    So he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across. He was a big strong man and
                    there was no one he couldn't carry.
          
          Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.
          
                              ELI
                    Then one day a young child came to
                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across. Christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy. He was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried.
                    The boy explained that he was the
                    son of God, and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world. After that,
                    Christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river. And that's how he became
                    a saint. Later on, he was known as
                    the patron saint of travelers.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What is a saint, anyway?
          
                                                                 79.
          
          
                              ELI
                    It's someone who spent their life
                    doing good things for others.
                    Enough that God himself took a
                    special interest in them.
          
          Solara looks at Eli tenderly, with admiration.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Someone like you.
          
          Eli looks away, down at the ground. He appears sad.
          
                              ELI
                    No. Not like me. Saints ain't
                    killers. And I done too much of
                    that. Spilled too much blood.
          
          BEAT. No words, just the flickering firelight.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Will you read me some more from the
                    book?
          
                              ELI
                    It's late. You should get some
                    sleep. Maybe tomorrow.
          
          LATER - NIGHT
          
          The fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his
          pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat
          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.
          
          Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after
          all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so
          impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Eli?
          
          No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his
          side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.
          
          She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing,
          stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel,
          hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.
          
          It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue
          colors faded and worn. It reads:
          
                               WELCOME TO WAL-MART
                                 MY NAME IS "ELI"
                               HOW MAY I HELP YOU?
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          She stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of
          it. Then moves on, continuing to pat him down.
          
          Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her
          attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.
          
          There it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little
          package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it.
          
          Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST.
          She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark
          shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little
          scary to Solara.
          
                              ELI
                    What are you doing?
          
                              SOLARA
                    You scared me! I thought you were
                    asleep.
          
                              ELI
                    On the road you sleep with one eye
                    open. I asked you what you were
                    doing.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I just wanted to see the book.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to see the book, you ask
                    me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever.
                    Until it gets where it's going. Do
                    you understand?
          
          He's very forceful. She nods, a little afraid of him.
          
                              ELI
                    Tell me you understand!
          
          He grips her wrist tighter.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Okay! I understand! Ow!
          
          Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it
          up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.
          
                              ELI
                    It's no use to you anyway. You
                    don't know how to read it.
          
                                                                 81.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    Well... now we have the time, maybe
                    you can teach me.
          
                              ELI
                    Maybe. Get some sleep.
          
          She lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes.
          She just lies there, watching him.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN
          
          The sun rises out of the east. And out of the sun comes the
          FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES. Racing side-by-side down the road.
          
          The lead vehicle comes to a halt. A door opens and Redridge
          gets out. MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and
          follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside.
          
          The DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew
          them. A FLOCK OF BUZZARDS is picking their bones clean.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's been here.
          
          Redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the
          bodies and back onto the road. Two sets of tracks.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    The girl's with him.
          
          He moves back to the cars.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                    Move out!
          
          The other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half-
          eaten bodies in the dirt. Redridge turns back.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    I said move out!
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN
                    I heard this guy's protected
                    somehow, some... power from up
                    above. That there ain't nothing on
                    this earth can touch him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's just a man. You put a bullet
                    in him, he'll go down like any
                    other. I don't want to hear no more
                    of this superstitious horseshit!
          
                                                                 82.
          
          
          Hesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. The
          cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the
          abandoned Chevron station. Dust pluming in their wake.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara walk together, passing by a few burned-out
          buildings. It appears we might be headed toward a town.
          
          Solara looks up at the sweltering sun. Then around at her
          surroundings. Nothing but devastation and decay.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You say you've been walking for
                    twenty-five years. Have you ever
                    considered that you might be lost?
          
                                 ELI
                    No.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But how can you know? How can you
                    know this is the right way?
          
                              ELI
                    I told you. My path has been laid
                    out before me.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Yeah, but laid out by who?
          
                              ELI
                    By Almighty God.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Well if this God guy's so mighty,
                    how come it's taking you so long to
                    get where you're going? Doesn't he
                    know the way?
          
          Eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to stay on this road with
                    me, don't ever let me hear you take
                    his name in vain like that again.
          
          Solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Sorry.
          
          Eli resumes walking.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
                              ELI
                    God has a reason for everything
                    being the way it is. It's not
                    always apparent to us. But it is
                    his plan nonetheless.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So, is he talking to you right now?
                    Telling you where to go?
          
                              ELI
                    It's not like that. It's kinda hard
                    to explain. I'm guided by faith.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't know what that word means.
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it.
          
                              ELI
                    It means you know something even
                    though you don't know it.
          
          Solara thinks about this, shakes her head.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That doesn't make any sense at all.
          
                              ELI
                    It doesn't have to.
          
          They walk on.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost
          every building burned or reduced to rubble.
          
          Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn
          but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its
          surroundings for being the only structure still intact.
          
          The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with
          SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot
          surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE.
          
          Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't get it. It looks almost...
                    normal. Like nothing ever happened.
                    How can it still be out here?
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I don't know.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Maybe we should look inside. There
                    might be food.
          
          BEAT as Eli considers. Then stands and unhooks his shotgun.
          
                              ELI
                    Stay behind me.
          
          They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter
          fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK.
          
          Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the
          padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK.
          
          They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the
          yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS
          arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.
          
                              SOLARA
                    This is weird.
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah.
          
          Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING
          STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet.
          Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down.
          
                              ELI
                    Shit.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What?
          
          A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at
          their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli
          drops his shotgun to the ground.
          
          They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.
          
          The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...
          
          AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat
          bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They
          look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
          
          Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN
          which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara.
          
                                                                 85.
          
          
          They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully.
          The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's
          shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Eli. This is Solara.
                    We're travelers, that's all. We
                    don't mean you any harm.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    You cut my padlock. I saw you.
                    Trying to break into our house.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody
                    lived here. We thought it was
                    abandoned, like all the rest.
          
          This seems to annoy the man.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Take a look around you. Look at
                    this yard. Does it look abandoned
                    to you?
          
          Clearly he's proud of the work he's done with the pitiful
          means at his disposal.
          
                              ELI
                    No, sir. I... like what you've done
                    with the place.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    What's your business here?
          
                              ELI
                    No business. We're sorry to have
                    troubled you. If you'll let us down
                    we'll happily be on our way.
          
          The wife steps forward, she's much warmer, less guarded.
          
                              ELDERLY WOMAN
                    George, look at them! They're not
                    robbers or road agents! One of
                    them's just a girl!
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Seen that before. Oldest trick in
                    the book.
          
                                                                   86.
          
          
                              ELDERLY WOMAN
                    Oh, stop! It's no trick. Let them
                    down!
          
          The woman glares at him. The husband reluctantly accedes and
          moves to the concealed trap apparatus. Releases the rope,
          dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap.
          
          The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the
          noose from their ankles.
          
                                ELDERLY WOMAN
                    I'm so sorry about my husband. We
                    so rarely get visitors these days,
                    he's suspicious of everybody.
                         (BEAT)
                    I'm Martha and this is my husband
                    George. Would you care for some
                    tea?
          
          Eli and Solara exchange a look. What the hell is this?
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          It's like something out of the world before. The interior is
          almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany
          table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.
          
          Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and
          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.
          
          George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them
          inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.
          
          Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a
          tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact.
          She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.
          
                              MARTHA
                    I'm afraid we don't have any cake
                    or biscuits for the tea. They ran
                    out some time ago.
          
          She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not
          tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare
          at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Please.
          
          They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly.
          It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
          civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.
          
                                                                 87.
          
          
                              MARTHA
                    How do you like it?
          
                              ELI
                    It's.. uh...
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's very good.
          
          Martha smiles, delighted. She lifts her own cup to her lips.
          HER HANDS TREMBLE, the cup rattling against the saucer.
          
                              ELI
                    Have you always lived here?
          
                              MARTHA
                    For almost forty years now. This
                    home is our pride and joy, isn't
                    it, George?
          
          George just grunts. Not interested in conversation.
          
                              MARTHA
                    We refused to leave, even during
                    the troubles. We said, didn't we
                    George, we said if we're going to
                    die anywhere, we're going to die
                    right here, in our own home.
          
                              ELI
                    I don't understand how you've
                    survived out here this long.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Well, George is something of a
                    handyman, aren't you, dear? He did
                    a lot of work on the place, making
                    it safe. We may be old, but we're
                    resilient. We've had more than a
                    few who've tried to take this place
                    from us. Haven't we, George?
          
                              GEORGE
                    Yes. Yes we have.
          
          He stands and moves toward the back door. Opens it up and
          beckons Eli and Solara to come look.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara stand in the doorway, looking out on the yard.
          Solara is horrified by what she sees.
          
                                                                 88.
          
          
          The entire back yard is a GRAVEYARD. Maybe twenty human
          graves dug shallow into the earth. Some were dug long ago,
          others look like they're very recent.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Are these... graves?
          
                              MARTHA
                    Of course. It would be uncivilized
                    not to bury them. We're not
                    barbarians.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Plus, it's good for the soil.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Come on back inside. I think I
                    might be able to rustle up some
                    sandwiches.
          
          George and Martha go back inside, leaving Eli and Solara
          gazing at the little graveyard.
          
                              ELI
                    We have to get out of here.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They look so sweet... I would never
                    have believed they were killers.
          
                              ELI
                    They're worse than that.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    What?
          
                               ELI
                    They didn't just kill these people.
                        (BEAT)
                    They ate them.
          
          Solara is stunned.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    They what?
                              ELI
                    There's a disease in the outland.
                    Spread by eating human meat. It
                    affects the brain. Dementia, loss
                    of motor function. Did you notice
                    the old woman's hands shaking?
                    She's got it. They've both got it.
          
                                                                 89.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    Oh my God...
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara re-enter. Solara looks at George nervously.
          He's still carrying that shotgun.
          
          Martha's voice drifts in from the nearby KITCHEN.
          
                              MARTHA (O.S.)
                    I found some meat for those
                    sandwiches! Are you hungry?
          
                              SOLARA
                    No! Thank you!
          
                              ELI
                    We really must be going.
          
                               GEORGE
                    So soon?
          
          An unnerving glint in his eye. Eli moves toward the door.
          
                              ELI
                    Yes, I'm afraid so.
          
          As he gets to the door, George moves to intercept. Hard to
          tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for
          him. A tense BEAT.
          
          Martha emerges from the kitchen.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Are you sure you won't stay?
          
                              ELI
                    Yes. Thank you again for the tea.
          
          Eli stares George down. Reluctantly, George steps aside. Eli
          opens the door and escorts Solara outside.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara emerge into the sunlight. Walk down the garden
          path. And FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS.
          
          THE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING. Driving toward them out of the
          horizon in a hazy cloud of dust.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men.
          
                                                                 90.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Are you sure?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I recognize the cars.
          
                              ELI
                    Back inside.
          
          Eli bundles Solara back into the house. George stands in the
          doorway, squinting at the approaching convoy.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          George follows them back in, furious.
          
                              GEORGE
                    What did you bring upon us?
          
                              MARTHA
                    George? What's wrong?
          
                              GEORGE
                    A whole convoy of armed
                    degenerates, that's what's wrong!
                    Coming here for them! And they led
                    them right to us!
          
          Martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain.
          Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT.
          
          The men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind
          them, locking and loading weapons.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Oh no they don't...
          
          She rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Martha, what are you doing?
          
                              MARTHA
                    I finally got this house just the
                    way I want it. I'm not going to let
                    anybody tear it apart!
          
          She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions.
          Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal:
          
          A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols.
          Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything.
          
                                                                 91.
          
          
          She pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN, slings the strap over her
          shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS. She looks like a
          post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where did you get all this stuff?
          
          George pulls out an AK-47, slots in a magazine.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Took `em off them who came looking
                    to take the place from us. Built up
                    quite the stash over the years.
          
          He offers a .44 MAGNUM to Solara.
          
                              GEORGE
                    You know how to fire a gun?
          
                              SOLARA
                    My daddy showed me once.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Just like riding a bike.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never rode a bike.
          
          George sighs, turns instead to Eli.
          
                              GEORGE
                    How about you, you know how to-
          
          Eli is already reloading his shotgun, checking the barrel.
          Readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Never mind.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge steps forward, raises a BULLHORN.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We know you're in there! Come on
                    out with your hands up and your
                    weapons on the deck and nobody
                    needs to get hurt.
          
          SILENCE. No sign of activity inside the house.
          
          Redridge turns back to his men. Their hands trembling. They
          didn't sign up for this, and they're not ready for it.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          Redridge turns back to the house. Into the bullhorn:
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    All right, look. I'm gonna make it
                    easy on y'all. Bring out the girl
                    with the book.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli is crouched beneath the window. George and Martha have
          taken up positions at other windows, peering out.
          
                              REDRIDGE (O.S.)
                    That's all we want. The girl and
                    the book. The rest of you's can go
                    your way.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What are we going to do?
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks.
          
                              ELI
                    Hand me my pack.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Redridge waits. Still no sign of a response. His nervous
          gunmen exchange worried looks.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #2
                    They ain't comin' out. They-
          
          Redridge raises his hand to silence him. Looks up as an
          UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open.
          
          A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window. It lands in the
          dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge.
          
          Cautiously, he approaches. The package is wrapped in cloth
          and tied up with twine. It looks like Eli's bible.
          
          He picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. Folds away
          the cloth wrapping. Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
          object, at the words written on the front of it.
          
                                THIS SIDE TO FACE ENEMY
          
          It's a MINIATURE CLAYMORE MINE. The small red light on top of
          the unit ILLUMINATES WITH A BEEP. Armed.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Holy shi...
          
                                                                    93.
          
          
          He drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back
          toward the vehicles.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                      Get down! Everybody get down!
          
          He dives across the trunk of the Explorer into cover as THE
          MINE EXPLODES, SHATTERING EVERY WINDOW OF EVERY VEHICLE. The
          lightweight Mini Cooper takes the main brunt and EXPLODES,
          cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck.
          
          Redridge looks around. Three men lie dead already. Flaming
          wreckage all around him. Suddenly, it's a war zone.
          
          MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOUSE, peppering the
          vehicles' armor. The gunmen cower behind cover.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                      Damn you, return fire!
          
          Redridge aims at the house and OPENS FIRE. Inspired by his
          example, the others follow. A HAIL OF BULLETS CRISS-CROSS
          BACK AND FORTH. The house's faded paint facade is shredded.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Martha continues firing wildly with the M-60. Screaming at
          the top of her lungs, loving every minute of it.
          
                                MARTHA
                      Come and get it, you god-damn sons
                      of mother-fucking bitches!
          
          George and Eli also open fire from their windows,
          periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire.
          
          Solara sits across the room, in the corner, sobbing.
          
                                ELI
                      It's all right. We're going to be
                      all right. Trust me.
          
          MORE GUNFIRE splinters the window frame above his head.
          
                                ELI
                      You remember what I told you about
                      faith?
          
          She nods.
          
          Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the
          enemy gunmen with a crack shot. Ducks back down as the return
          fire impacts around him.
          
                                                                 94.
          
          
                              ELI
                    We're going to get out of this
                    alive. Both of us. I know.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Because God told you?
          
                              ELI
                    Because God told me.
          
          Amidst all the chaos and gunfire, George has been listening
          to this exchange.
          
                              GEORGE
                    What about us?
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ELI
                    He didn't mention you.
          
          BEAT. George chambers a round and RESUMES FIRING.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge's men continue the hail of gunfire. Six of them dead
          now, six more still standing. No lessening of fire from
          inside the house. They're losing.
          
          Redridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire
          until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan. Pops the
          trunk and pulls out a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER.
          
          He sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his
          aim. And FIRES. The rocket screams toward its target, tearing
          through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM THE
          HOUSE in a fiery explosion.
          
          INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Filled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING.
          
          Dazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his
          arms to clear it. A BLOODY GASH on his forehead.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Martha? Martha!
          
          He finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the
          kitchen. Or at least her top half. The rest of her is gone.
          
          George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his
          wife tenderly by the hand for a moment.
          
                                                                    95.
          
          
          Then the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by
          a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He
          CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.
          
          George moves back toward the LIVING ROOM, firing as he goes.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge moves between the cars again, staying behind cover.
          George's hail of gunfire has them pinned down.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We got any more of those RPGs?
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #3
                    That was it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Screw this.
          
          Redridge jumps into the driver's seat of the minivan, turns
          the key in the ignition. Jams the accelerator down with the
          butt of his rifle, then shifts the transmission into DRIVE.
          
                                 REDRIDGE
                    Get clear!
          
          The gunmen leap clear as the minivan HURTLES TOWARD THE
          HOUSE, engine roaring. CRASHES THROUGH THE CHAIN FENCE.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM.
          He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE
          LIVING ROOM. It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL, finally coming to
          a stop.
          
          More dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but
          winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET
          WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands
          and moves through the smoke.
          
                                 ELI
                    Solara?
          
                                 SOLARA (O.S.)
                    Eli!
          
          He finds her in the smoke. She embraces him.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you all right?
          
                                                                 96.
          
          
                                SOLARA
                    I'm fine.
          
          As the smoke clears, Solara sees George PINNED AGAINST THE
          WALL BY THE MINIVAN. His body crushed. Dead.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Oh God...
          
                              ELI
                    Come on. We're going out the back.
                    We're running.
          
          As he helps her to her feet, we hear the sound of MOVEMENT
          THROUGH THE RUBBLE.
          
          They turn around. The gunmen are ENTERING THE HOUSE, passing
          through the smoking hole left by the minivan.
          
          Eli reaches for his sword. Met by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS
          COCKING. Redridge steps out from among the gunmen. Smiles.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Go ahead and try it, holy man. You
                    ain't that fast.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and
          marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles.
          
          Eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack. Redridge
          faces him and points a pistol at his head.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Where's the book?
          
          BEAT. Eli doesn't answer. Redridge cocks the pistol.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    I ain't playing.
          
          Redridge stares him down. Eli just stares right back. Totally
          unflappable. Redridge motions to his men.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Check the pack.
          
          The gunman carrying Eli's pack opens it up and tips its
          contents out onto the ground. The ghillie suit, battery, some
          old canned goods, other odds and ends. No sign of the book.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #4
                    It ain't here.
          
                                                                 97.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    It's gotta be.
          
          Redridge holsters his gun and frisks Eli, going through his
          pockets. Finds nothing. He opens Eli's coat and checks the
          inside pockets. Digs around deep inside.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Hello, what have we here?
          
          And then suddenly he SHRIEKS IN PAIN. Yanks his hand out to
          reveal ELI'S RAT, TEETH SUNK DEEP INTO HIS FLESH.
          
          Redridge flails around violently, trying to get the rat off
          him, but it won't let go. His hand is bleeding badly.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!
          
          He finally manages to shake it free. It hits the floor dazed.
          Redridge STOMPS ON IT with his boot, reducing it to a bloody
          smear in the dirt. Eli lowers his head in sadness.
          
          Redridge clutches his bloody hand, glares at Eli furiously.
          Pulls his gun again and marches right up to him, pressing the
          muzzle tight against his forehead.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    If you don't got the book, what
                    fucking use are you?
          
          His finger tightens on the trigger.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Wait!
          
          She breaks from the gunmen holding her and rushes toward
          Redridge. Reaches inside her dress and PRODUCES THE BIBLE.
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's here! I've got it! Please
                    don't kill him.
          
                                ELI
                    Solara...
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's just a book, Eli. No book is
                    worth giving up your life for.
          
                              ELI
                    You're wrong.
          
                                                                   98.
          
          
          Satisfied, Redridge takes the book. Runs his hand over the
          leather cover, gazes admiringly at the gold-embossed cross.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    You did good, sweetheart. Your
                    daddy would be proud. He knew you'd
                    come through for him.
          
          Solara looks at Eli guiltily. She feels terrible.
          
                              SOLARA
                    He said he would hurt my mom. If I
                    didn't help him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                        (SMILING)
                    Daddy's little girl...
          
          Solara stands between him and Eli. Deadly serious now.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I want you to let him go.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What?
          
                              SOLARA
                    You've got what you came for. You
                    don't need him. Let him go.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's killed a dozen of my men.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If you hurt him, I'm not coming
                    back with you. You'll have to drag
                    me kicking and screaming.
          
          Solara glares at Redridge. He sighs. He can tell she means
          it. It's not worth the aggravation. He turns back to Eli.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Take your shit and get out of here.
          
          Eli gathers up his stuff into his pack. Shoulders it and goes
          to pick up his sword, but Redridge puts his boot on it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    No weapons.
          
          Eli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him. He turns and
          walks away, toward the road. As he passes Solara:
          
                                                                   99.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I told you we'd both live. Now do
                    you have faith?
          
          A tear runs down Solara's cheek as she watches him walk away.
          
          Redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the
          vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out.
          
          IN THE REARMOST VEHICLE
          
          Solara sits in the back seat, staring out the rear window as
          it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy.
          
          She watches as Eli moves away down the road, getting smaller
          and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon.
          
          She bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears.
          
          LATER
          
          Solara in the back seat, calmer now. The tears dried on her
          cheeks. She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front.
          
          And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at
          the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come
          off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY.
          
          REDRIDGE'S VEHICLE
          
          The DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror.
          
                              DRIVER
                    What the hell...?
          
          Redridge turns to see the car behind VEERING ERRATICALLY then
          SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, stopping in the middle of the road.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Stop, stop!
          
          The car screeches to a halt. Redridge watches through the
          rear window as the driver's side door opens and the driver is
          KICKED OUT ONTO THE ASPHALT.
          
          The door closes again, the engine revs and the car TURNS
          AROUND, racing back down the road in the direction it came.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Shit. Turn around!
          
                              DRIVER
                    We ain't got the gas for it!
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    She's getting away!
          
                              DRIVER
                    We got the book! And we got barely
                    enough gas to make it back as it
                    is! We can't go chasin' her!
          
          BEAT. Redridge knows he's right.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    Stupid little bitch...
                        (BEAT)
                    Drive on.
          
          The car moves on, following the rest of the convoy.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking
          wreckage of the besieged house. She runs from the vehicle to
          where ELI'S SWORD lies in the dirt and grabs it up.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DUSK
          
          Solara races down the road in the car, pedal to the metal.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Come on, come on...
          
          Eventually, she sees him. At first just a dot on the horizon.
          But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere.
          
          Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the
          needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration.
          
                                SOLARA
                    No... No!
          
          The car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and
          leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot.
          
          ON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly
          ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west.
          
          Solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Eli! Eli!
          
          He doesn't stop or look back. Just keeps on walking.
          
          She finally catches up with him, breathing hard, exhausted.
          
                                                                  101.
          
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Eli...
          
                              ELI
                    Thought you'd gone back to town.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so
                    sorry.
          
                                 ELI
                    For what?
          
                              SOLARA
                    For what? I betrayed you! I gave
                    them the book!
          
                              ELI
                    You did what you believed you had
                    to.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You're not mad at me?
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ELI
                    I forgive you.
          
          She continues walking alongside him. Trying to process this.
          This kind of compassion is totally foreign to her.
          
          She holds out the sword, offering it to Eli by way of
          atonement.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Here. I thought you might still
                    need this.
          
          Eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to
          him. He takes it and slings it over his shoulder.
          
                                 ELI
                    Thank you.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What are you going to do now?
          
                              ELI
                    Same as always. Keep heading west.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Why? I mean, you don't have the
                    book any more.
          
                                                                  102.
          
          
                              ELI
                    But I still have my faith.
          
          They walk on together, into the sunset.
          
          EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - MONTAGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara follow the road through burned-out towns and
          retail neighborhoods. Gutted and dead, like every place else.
          
          But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of
          grass here and there. They attract Solara's attention.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's that?
          
          Eli reaches down and runs his hand through the grass.
          
                              ELI
                    It's grass. It used to grow all
                    over the place.
          
                              SOLARA
                    How come it's here?
          
                              ELI
                    I don't know. Less poison in the
                    air this near to the ocean, maybe.
          
          They keep walking. Eli groans, clutches his side. Does his
          best to hide his pain from Solara. She notices anyway.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's wrong?
          
                              ELI
                    Nothing. Just a cramp.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
          
          They walk on through the night. Eli stops and sniffs the air.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    What?
          
                              ELI
                    Do you smell that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Smell what?
          
                              ELI
                    Salt in the air. We're close to the
                    ocean. We're almost there.
          
                                                                103.
          
          
          EXT. CALIFORNIA ROAD - DAWN
          
          They keep on along the road. A shallow uphill incline. They
          follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop
          and take in the view before them.
          
          THE PACIFIC OCEAN. Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the
          once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of
          neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the
          ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.
          
          On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little
          that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY
          DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings
          still standing looking on the verge of collapse.
          
          Solara looks at it all in horrified awe. Eli, unperturbed,
          keeps on moving, still clutching his side.
          
                               ELI
                    Come on.
          
          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara make their way south across the bridge, side-
          stepping the fractures in the road.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO RUINS - DAY
          
          Eli leads Solara through the rubble of what used to be San
          Francisco. It's like walking through the wreckage of 9/11's
          Ground Zero, but a hundred times the scale. Horrifying.
          
          They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL, nothing but the lobby
          still standing. A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble.
          
          Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around
          ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    Watch your footing. Step where I
                    step.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
          
          More buildings are still standing here, but they're nothing
          more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the
          blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it.
          
          The buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares
          her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world.
          
                              SOLARA
                    This... this is the world before?
          
                                                                104.
          
          
                              ELI
                    What's left of it.
          
          They keep walking, passing the TOPPLED TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FISHERMAN'S WHARF - DAY
          
          Once a bustling oceanside tourist spot, now a ghost town.
          
          Eli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing
          the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The
          celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped
          at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS.
          
          Eli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His
          breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAY
          
          A dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. We hear the sound
          of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all.
          
          Eli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end.
          The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a
          RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's
          sheared-off edge.
          
          Eli and Solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea.
          
                              ELI
                    Do you see that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I see it. Is that it?
          
                                 ELI
                    That's it.
          
          Reveal now that the rope-bridge leads out across the bay to:
          
          ALCATRAZ ISLAND
          
          Looking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated.
          The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It
          feels almost like a mythic place - the "promised land" Eli
          has sought for so many years.
          
          A tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze
          atop the prison lighthouse.
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          EXT. BAY ROPE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara make their way carefully across the bridge. It
          feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters
          below close enough to lap around their ankles.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara arrive at the prison gates. Securely locked.
          As they inspect it for a possible way to enter:
          
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Who goes there?
          
          They look up. A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed
          in one of the perimeter towers. Training a rifle on them.
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Identify yourselves!
          
          In the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on
          them too. Eli looks up, raises his hands.
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Elijah Stone. I have a
                    message for your boss. I need you
                    to tell him that I have a King
                    James Bible in my possession.
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Remain where you are! Do not
                    attempt to move or you will be
                    fired upon!
          
          Keeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his
          free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear
          the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait.
          
          The guard puts away his radio and shouts back down:
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Be prepared to surrender any
                    weapons at the gate!
          
          BEAT. And then the massive front gates SLOWLY OPEN ON
          MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron.
          
          Eli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside.
          
                                                                106.
          
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - MAIN GATES - CONTINUOUS
          
          As soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF
          HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi-
          official militia. But every bit as deadly.
          
          Eli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take
          Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    They're clean.
          
          The soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN, BALDING MAN
          wearing spectacles. He wears Kevlar body armor over his tweed
          jacket and tie. Professorial, academic.
          
          He approaches, shakes Eli's hand vigorously - very excited.
          
                              THIN MAN
                    Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor
                    Lombardi. I'm the curator here.
          
                              ELI
                    Elijah Stone.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Solara.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Solara. What a delightful name. Is
                    that by any chance Shakespearean?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I, uh, I think it's Japanese.
          
                                 LOMBARDI
                    Wonderful.
          
          He turns back to Eli.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Is it true what they tell me? You
                    have a King James Version?
          
                              ELI
                    Been carrying it with me for twenty-
                    five years.
          
          Solara looks at Eli, puzzled. Lombardi finds it hard to
          contain his excitement.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    My goodness. I can't tell you how
                    exciting this is. Well, come, come!
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                107.
          
                              LOMBARDI (cont'd)
                    I'll give you the nickel tour and
                    then we can all sit down and take a
                    look at it.
          
          He leads them across the courtyard into the prison buildings.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Redridge's remaining vehicles drive back into town and come
          to a halt outside the theater. Redridge emerges from his car,
          carrying the bible. Walks up to the Palladium and enters.
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CELL BLOCK - DAY
          
          What was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY. Stacked
          floor to ceiling with books. Lombardi shows Eli and Solara
          around. Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Yes, we've been doing this for some
                    time now. Collected over thirty
                    thousand volumes from generous
                    donors all across the nation. We
                    even have a printing press that we
                    hope to have operational soon.
          
          Solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books.
          She's never seen anything like it.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You turned the whole prison into a
                    library?
          
                               LOMBARDI
                    Well, not exactly. We're more like
                    a storage facility. We're holding
                    these books here in trust, if you
                    like. When society gets back on its
                    feet and no longer needs us to
                    preserve these volumes, they'll be
                    here waiting.
                        (BEAT)
                    I must ask you, how did you hear
                    about us? We've been doing
                    everything we can to get the word
                    out, but we always like to know
                    where our benefactors come from.
          
                              ELI
                    I was sent here by God.
          
          Lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
                               LOMBARDI
                    Is that right? Well, it's good to
                    know we're getting such high-
                    profile referrals these days.
                        (BEAT)
                    I must say, I am so excited that we
                    finally have a King James. You
                    know, we have a Talmud here, we
                    have two Korans, we even have that
                    Scientology book. But never a
                    Christian bible, until now. I
                    honestly believed it was the one
                    book I'd never see again, after
                    what happened...
          
          BEAT. Lombardi appears sad for a moment.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    May I ask what condition it's in?
          
                              ELI
                    It's a little beat-up. But it'll do
                    the job.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Well, then. What say we take a look
                    at it?
          
          Lombardi looks at Eli with anticipation. So does Solara,
          interested to know where this is going to go next.
          
          Eli winces in pain, puts his hand to his side.
          
                              ELI
                    Is there someplace we could sit?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Of course. Right this way.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Redridge appears. Carnegie looks at him eagerly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did you get it?
          
          Redridge holds the bible up proudly. Carnegie beams.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Show me.
          
          Redridge hands it over. Carnegie sits back in his chair,
          running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    The new world begins here...
          
          He opens the book and looks inside.
          
          BEAT. And then he looks up at Redridge, confused.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What the fuck is this?
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Eli, Solara and Lombardi sit at one of the long lunch-room
          tables. The two armed guards keep watch nearby.
          
                              ELI
                    Do you have something you can write
                    with?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Mmm? Oh, yes of course!
          
          He pulls a pen from his pocket, motions to one of the guards.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Could you please bring us some
                    writing paper?
          
          The guard nods and moves toward the door. As he does so:
          
                              ELI
                    Bring a lot of it.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie looks at the open bible, jaw hanging loose, his
          complexion ashen. Like he's just been slapped in the face.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What? What is it?
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          The guard brings a THICK SHEAF OF WRITING PAPER to the
          cafeteria table, sets it down by Lombardi.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you ready?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    What exactly am I writing?
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Pay close attention and write down
                    every word exactly as I say it.
          
          Eli removes his goggles. Solara can't believe what she sees.
          
          His eyes are pale, milky-white, dead. TOTALLY BLIND.
          
                              ELI
                    The First Book of Moses called
                    Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In
                    the beginning God created the
                    heavens and the earth. Verse two.
                    The earth was without form, and
                    void; and darkness was on the face
                    of the deep. And the spirit of God
                    was hovering over the face of the
                    waters. Verse three. And God said,
                    "Let there be light," and there was
                    light.
          
          Lombardi hurriedly writes down every word.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. Eli's bible sits
          open on the desk before him.
          
          A BRAILLE BIBLE.
          
          Claudia is ushered in by a guard.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What's wrong?
          
          He rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You told me once that you know how
                    to read this. This blind language.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well, a long time ago, when I was a
                    little girl...
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You're going to read it for me.
                    Every word. And I'm going to write
                    it down. Start at the beginning.
          
          As Carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, Claudia
          opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised
          lettering.
          
                                                                111.
          
          
          For a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint
          smile... but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her,
          eagerly clutching the writing materials.
          
                               CLAUDIA
                    I'm sorry. It's been so long. I
                    don't remember. I don't remember
                    any of it.
          
          Carnegie is aghast. BEAT as the anger swells within him,
          threatening to explode...
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    God fucking dammit!
          
          He swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of
          Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two,
          but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosses it
          out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark
          auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats.
          
          As he paces angrily back past Claudia:
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Bill, is there something-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Just go. Just get out of my sight.
          
          He slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. Claudia sadly
          turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - NIGHT
          
          Some considerable time later. Great stacks of paper have been
          filled with Lombardi's handwriting.
          
          Lombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep up
          with Eli's recitation.
          
          Solara is curled up on a nearby bench, asleep. Eli's coat
          covering her to keep her warm.
          
          Eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite.
          He looks paler now than ever. Close to death.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Dear Lord, thank you for giving me
                    the strength and the conviction to
                    complete the task you entrusted to
                    me. Thank you for guiding me
                    straight and true, through the many
                    obstacles in my path.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                112.
          
                              ELI (V.O.) (cont'd)
                    And for keeping me resolute when
                    all around seemed lost.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - PRE-DAWN
          
          The prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn.
          
          Solara crosses the yard. She looks more mature somehow.
          Determined and strong. She carries with her ELI'S SWORD - and
          something else, tucked under her arm.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for your protection and
                    for your many signs along the way.
          
          She stops in a nondescript corner of the yard.
          
          At her feet is a SHALLOW MOUND OF DIRT. At the head of the
          mound, a SIMPLE TOMBSTONE.
          
          She kneels and places a SINGLE FLOWER on the grave.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Lit only by the pale moonlight, barely enough to see by.
          
          Carnegie sleeps soundly in bed. Next to him lies Claudia,
          wide awake. She checks that Carnegie is sound asleep, careful
          not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          
          Claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness, searching
          blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats.
          
          She finds Eli's bible in some litter strewn on the floor.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for the good that I have
                    done. For whatever light you were
                    able to shine into the darkness of
                    this world through me.
          
          Sitting in the darkness, Claudia opens the book and runs her
          fingers across the braille, reading. And though we can barely
          see in the dim light, we see the smile on her face. The joy.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - DAWN
          
          As Solara kneels by the grave, we see now that she wears
          Eli's SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT around her neck.
          
          The tombstone reads:
          
                                                                113.
          
          
                               HERE LIES ELIJAH STONE
                                DIED AUGUST 21, 2048
                            FAITHFUL SERVANT TO THE LORD
                                AND FRIEND TO SOLARA
          
          She unsheathes Eli's sword, plants it in the ground before
          his grave. Takes the BOOK from under her arm and opens it up.
          
          It's a NEW BIBLE. Crudely typeset from Lombardi's original
          transcription and printed on the prison press.
          
          She opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible
          over Eli's grave. We don't hear what she says.
          
          As Solara finishes her reading and closes the bible, LOMBARDI
          appears behind her.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    You know, you don't have to leave.
                    You're welcome to stay here with
                    us. You'll be safe.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Thanks.
          
          She stands, pulling Eli's sword from the earth.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But I gotta do what I gotta do.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Where will you go?
          
          BEAT. Solara looks at the sword, her fingers playing across
          its hilt. The blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun.
          
          There is a determined, purposeful look in her eye.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Home.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAWN
          
          The sun rises through the fog on the horizon.
          
          The great iron gates grind open. Solara emerges from inside
          the prison, steps out onto the island rock.
          
          She is dressed in a flak jacket, combat pants and boots.
          Eli's old pack across her back. Hair tied in a neat pony
          tail. Atop that, Eli's ragged fur hat.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for the friend I made.
          
                                                                114.
          
          
          In her hand she clutches a copy of the newly-printed bible.
          Eli's sword slung over her shoulder.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Please watch over her as you
                    watched over me.
          
          MONTAGE as Solara walks back along Fisherman's Wharf...
          through the San Francisco rubble... across the Golden Gate
          bridge...
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for allowing me finally
                    to rest. I'm so very tired. The
                    time of my departure is at hand and
                    now I surrender my soul into your
                    care, at peace in knowing that I
                    have carried out your will. That I
                    have done right with my time on
                    this earth.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          ...and finally back onto a desolate road leading off into the
          desert wasteland. She looks up and down the road, then turns
          and heads toward the sun on the horizon. Headed east.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    I have fought the good fight. I
                    have finished the race.
          
          As she walks away into the sun, her lonely silhouette on the
          road reminds us of Eli as we saw him so many times before.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    I have kept the faith.
          
          She grows smaller and smaller as she walks into the distance,
          until she consumed by the rising sun and we
          
                                                          FADE OUT:

                                                     Sep 30th, 2006                         

                         

          OVER A BLACI: SCREEN:
          Crickets chirp in the night.
          A DOORBELL rings.
          Sheets rustle...
          A BEDSIDE LAMP is turned on.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          NORMA LEWIS ( 31) sits up in bed. The soft glow of the lamp
           casts her in silhouette. Her husband, ARTHUR LEWIS (30), lies
          next to her.

                          NORMA
          Did you hear something?

                         ARTHUR
          The doorbell.

                         NORMA
          Are you sure that was the doorbell?
          From down below... the DOORBELL rings again.

                         ARTHUR
          Yep.
          Norma retrieves her WATCH from the bedside table.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          What time is it?

                         NORMA
          Quarter 'til five.
          Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe.
          Arthur sits up, hair sticking up in every direction. He has
          sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          Norma comes down the stairs and approaches the front door.
          She looks through the PEEPHOLE.
          Through the PEEPHOLE... she glimpses a BLACK SEDAN idling in
          the street. It quickly drives off.
          Norma unlatches the DEAD BOLT and opens the door. She notices
          something at her feet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Someone has left a CARDBOARD BOX on the front step. It's
          dimensions are 1' x 1' x 1'
          She leans down and picks up the box, noticing that it has
          been meticulously sealed with clear tape. There are no
          markings on it whatsoever.
          Norma looks down the quiet, empty street. She quickly closes
          the door and turns inside and away from the cold air.
          Arthur arrives at the bottom of the stairs.

                         ARTHUR
          What is it?

                         NORMA
          Someone left a box.

                         ARTHUR
          Who?

                         NORMA
          I don't know. There was a car
          waiting... but they drove off.
          Norma hands the box to Arthur. He examines it.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Is that one of my Christmas
          presents?
          Their young son, WALTER LEWIS ( 9), is standing at the top of
          the stairs. He is dressed in his pajamas.
          His parents just stare back at him in silence.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

          The Lewis family has now moved into the kitchen. WRAPPING
          PAPER and CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS are scattered across the table.
          Norma is pouring COFFEE. Arthur is cutting through the tape
          that seals the box with a knife while Walter looks on
          eagerly.

                         WALTER
          Should I close my eyes?

                         ARTHUR
          Maybe... it's up to you.
          Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS
          inside. He digs down and retrieves a WOODEN BOX. Its
          dimensions are 8" x 8" x 8".

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          The box is made of WHITE OAK with a clear varnish. Mounted on
          top is a CLEAR GLASS DOME attached to a lid with a HINGE
          MOUNT. Inside of the dome is a CYLINDRICAL METAL BUTTON.

                         NORMA
          Is there a note?
          Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE
          ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name:

          MRS. LEWIS

                         ARTHUR
          It's for you, Norma.
          Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white
          stationary.
          Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence:

          MR. STEWARD WILL CALL UPON YOU AT 5:00 PM.

                         NORMA
          Mr. Steward will call upon you at 5

          PM.

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Do I know a Mr. Steward?
          Arthur yawns.

                         ARTHUR
          I dunno. You tell us.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- LATER THAT MORNING

          Arthur is now showered and shaven, dressed for work. He and
          Walter sit at the kitchen table, waiting for Norma to deliver
          breakfast.
          The box sits on the table between them.
          Arthur opens up the newspaper.

          Arthur turns the page.

                         ARTHUR
          What kind of car was it?

                         NORMA
          I couldn't see. It was dark and 1
          didn't have my contacts in.

                         WALTER
          Why would they just drive off?

                         NORMA
          I don't know. But the bus will be
          here if five minutes... so eat.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma and Walter emerge from the house onto the front porch.
          She hands him his LUNCH BOX and a WINTER HAT. SNOW has begun
          to fall from the sky.

                         WALTER
          Last day of school and now it
          starts to snow?!

                         NORMA
          Put on your hat...
          A young girl, DANA ( 13) is waiting at the end of the
           sidewalk. She is wrapped head-to-toe in warm clothes...
          EARMUFFS and SCARF around her neck.

                         DANA
          (muffled through scarf)
          Hi Mrs. Lewis.

                         NORMA
          Good morning, Dana.

                         (SHIVERING)
          And please call me Norma. You're
          making me feel old.

                         WALTER
          You are old!

                         NORMA
          I'm thirty-one!

                         WALTER
          To us that's old! You're a geezer!

                         NORMA
          Well you'll be a geezer one day
          too, smarty-pants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          Norma closes her eyes, taking in a breath of cold air.
          Snowflakes land in her face and hair.
          Walter sighs... looking at his watch.

                         WALTER
          Why does the bus stop have to be at
          the end of our driveway?

                         NORMA

                         (HIGH-PITCHED)
          So I can watch my little Walter get
          on his bus... safe in one piece!
          Down the street, A SCHOOL BUS begins to crest the hill...
          fast approaching...

                         WALTER
          Please. Go. Inside. You're
          embarrassing me.

                         NORMA
          My love embarrasses you?

                         WALTER
          Yes. Yes it does.
          She begins to walk down the sidewalk... taunting him as the
          bus approaches.

                         NORMA
          What if I give little Walter a
          little kiss in front of all his
          friends on the school bus?
          Dana's eyes widen. A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN emerges from behind the
          scarf that covers the lower part of her face.

                         DANA
          Do it!
          The bus is fast approaching... brakes squealing as it slows
          to a stop.

                         WALTER
          Don't come any closer!
          Norma gives him a big HUG and a KISS right as the bus doors
          open. A bunch of OLDER KIDS stare out the window... scowling
          at him.
          Walter pushes away from her and stomps up onto the bus...
          mortified. Dana follows him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         NORMA
          Dana... you're baby-sitting for us
          tonight, right?

                         DANA
          Eight o'clock?

                         NORMA
          Eight o'clock.

                         DANA
          Okay.
          Dana gets on the bus. BUD WALL (30s), the bus driver, smiles
          at Norma. He is an enormous giant of a man with a shaved
          head.

                         NORMA
          Bus-Driver Bud! Merry Christmas...

                         BUD
          Our last day!

                         NORMAL
          I know!

                         BUD
          It'll all be over soon, Norma.
          He stares at her for a moment that is almost too long... then
          shuts the doors to the bus.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur sits at the table... reading the morning paper.
          The CAMERA zooms into the COMICS SECTION... revealing the
          panels of the comic strip REX MORGAN, MD. Arthur begins
          reading the voices of REX MORGAN and his girlfriend JUNE.

                         ARTHUR
          (as Rex Morgan)
          Do you realize that this is the
          first time in my life that I will
          be taking more than a week's
          vacation, June?
          Norma arrives in the kitchen. She now has a slight limp.

                         ARTHUR (CONT-D)
          (as June, hi-pitched)
          And enjoy it! Don't worry about the
          office!

          7.

                         NORMA
          Rex Morgan... I need you back here
          no later than seven. Rehearsal
          dinner starts at eight.
          Arthur grabs his BRIEFCASE and a BASKETBALL.

                         ARTHUR
          The Viking Squad has a game at
          four.

                         NORMA
          Don't get stuck in Friday
          traffic...

                         ARTHUR
          Okay June.
          He starts bouncing the ball on the kitchen floor.
          She grabs the ball in mid bounce... annoyed with him.

                         NORMA
          Not in the house!

                         ARTHUR
          How's your foot?

                         NORMA
          It's fine.
          She pushes him toward into the FAMILY ROOM... opening the
          door that leads out to the garage.
          They exit the house and the CAMERA drifts back toward the
          kitchen table... moving in toward the box.

           EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           The GARAGE DOOR opens and both of the LEWIS FAMILY CARS back
           out at the same time, almost choreographed in perfect unison.
           Arthur drives a SILVER 1975 PONTIAC TRANS-AM. Norma drives a
          WHITE 1976 OLDSMOBILE STATION WAGON with WOOD WALLS.
          They pull out onto MONUMENT AVENUE, cars pointing in opposite
          directions. Arthur rolls down his window.

                         ARTHUR
          It's your Christmas present.

                         NORMA
          From you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          B.

                         ARTHUR
          From your secret lover.

                         (BEAT)
          Mr. Steward.
          She furrows her brow.

                         NORMA

                         (SARCASTIC)
          I hate you, Rex Morgan MD.

                         ARTHUR

                         (PLAYFUL)
          I hate you, too.

                         NORMA
          Don't be late tonight.

                         ARTHUR
          I've got your present at work. It's
          almost finished.
          He smiles... then peels off down Monument Ave.
          From Norma's REAR VIEW MIRROR... Arthur's car disappears down
          the road. She reaches up to re-adjust... her eyes appear in
          the mirror's reflection.
          INSERT: Norma's VIRGINIA license plate.
          The Oldsmobile drives down the street in the opposite
          direction.

          EXT. DOWNTOWN RICHMOND -- MORNING

          HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA crests over the barren WINTER
          FOREST on the southeast side of the city... tipping up to
          reveal DOWNTOWN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.

          RADIO VOICE (V.0.)
          It's twenty-three degrees on this
          December morning here in
          Richmond...
          The CAMERA moves over the DOWNTOWN EXPRESSWAY... heavy
          traffic moves in either direction.
          The CAMERA approaches the side of ARTHUR'S TRANS-AM as it
          crests around the INTERSTATE EXCHANGE onto ROUTE 64 at the
          HISTORICAL CLOCK TOWER of MAIN STREET TRAIN STATION.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          RADIO VOICE (V.0.) (CONT - D)
          The French government, in what was
          seen here as a gesture to President-
          elect Jimmy Carter, announced
          Thursday a further tightening of
          controls over the exportation of
          nuclear technology.
          The CAMERA swoops down alongside the driver's side of
          Arthur's car... moving into the SIDE VIEW MIRROR. His face
          reflected in the mirror... listening to the radio as he
          begins his southbound commute to work.

          EXT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- MORNING

          The CAMERA pulls back from .a sign at the entrance to
          COLLEGIATE... an exclusive PRIVATE SCHOOL. Norma's STATION
          WAGON pulls into the school parking lot.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          The CAMERA tracks with Norma as makes her way through the
          CROWDED HALLWAY... filled with LOUD TEENAGERS from the age of
          9-18. Her limp. has gotten worse.
          She WINKS at someone... then turns a corner and the CAMERA
          whips around to reveal WALTER standing at his locker. He
           closes the door, revealing Dana and another friend named
          CHARLES ( 12) standing there.

                         DANA
          Why does your mom limp?

                         CHARLES
          Yeah... is something wrong with her
          foot?

                         WALTER
          That's none of your business.

                         CHARLES
          Dana saw her take her shoe off in
          the parking lot yesterday.

                         DANA
          There's definitely something wrong
          with her foot. It looks mangled.

                         CHARLES
          You didn't say mangled... you said
          it looked gross.
          Walter lunges at Charles and pushes him up against the
          locker... awkwardly trying to fight him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          They continue to wrestle awkwardly for a moment against the
          lockers and then Walter lets go... backing away.

                         WALTER
          If you ever make fun of my mom
          again I'll kill you!
          Walter storms off down the hall.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

          The CAMERA moves through the SCHOOL OFFICE as teachers and
          RECEPTIONISTS move about in preparation for the last day,
          approaching a FROSTED GLASS DOOR that reads:

          DR. WILLIAM H. POATES

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          Norma sits across from the desk of WILLIAM POATES (45), the
          principal of the school.

                         POATES
          The uhhh... the board came to a
          vote last week, so it's official.
          They've officially cancelled the
          faculty tuition discount.

                         NORMA
          So what does that mean for me?

          P OATE S
          You're going to have to start
          paying full tuition for your son.

                         NORMA
          Starting when?

                         POATES
          Next semester.
          Norma notices a SMALL DROP of BLOOD forming in his right
          nostril.

                         NORMA
          Okay.

                         POATES
          I'm real sorry about this, Norma.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         NORMA
          Yeah, me too. I've got three weeks
          to figure out how to tell my son we
          can't afford to send him to
          Collegiate any more.
          The drop of blood has begun to flow down onto his upper lip.

                         POATES
          Like I said, I'm real sorry.

                         NORMA
          Yeah... your nose is bleeding.
          Poates reaches for his HANDKERCHIEF and puts it to his face,
          wiping off the blood. The MORNING BELL rings.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma walks hurriedly down the empty hallway. Her limp has
          gotten worse as the morning grind has now begun.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma comes into her CLASSROOM... a SCIENCE LAB with SINKS
          and BUNSEN BURNERS mounted in MARBLE TOP DESKS. Kids are
          moving about... loud and rambunctious.

                         NORMA
          Okay... everyone quiet down! Take
          your seats!
          Norma moves toward a stack of METAL TRAYS on her desk. Inside
          of each tray is a BALL OF BLACK MUSH.

                         NORMA (CONT-D)
          Today is the day many of you have
          been eagerly awaiting. You get to
          dissect owl pellets.
          A MALE STUDENT ( 13) pumps his fist...

                         MALE STUDENT #1
          Yes!
          Norma sets an OWL PELLET down in front of a FEMALE STUDENT
          ( 12). She looks at the owl pellet in disgust.

                         FEMALE STUDENT #1
          This is so gross.
          Norma sets a tray down in front of Charles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         CHARLES
          Why do they call it an owl pellet?
          A MALE STUDENT ( 12) next to him takes his tray from Norma.

                         MALE STUDENT #2
          Because they shit out of their
          mouths.

                         NORMA
          Hey... watch the language. You say
          another cuss word I've gotta send
          you to detention, okay?

                         MALE STUDENT #2
          Sorry, Mrs. Lewis.

                         FEMALE STUDENT #1
          Is it true?

                         NORMA
          Is what true?

                         FEMALE STUDENT #1
          That owls poo out of their mouths.

                         NORMA
          Yes... this is true.
          The classroom gasps in disgust... others laugh.

                         NORMA (CONT-D)
          Grey forest owls feed upon field
          mice, squirrels and small birds.
          The owl will then regurgitate the
          bones and waste matter in a ball of
          black mucous. Inside this mucous
          you will likely find the entire
          skeleton of its prey.
          Norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a SCREEN.

                         NORMA (CONT-D)
          I'm going to show you a film about
          the digestive process of the owl,
          and how the owl pellet is formed.
          The classroom whispers with excitement.

          EXT. NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER -- ENTRANCE GATE -- MORNING

          Arthur pulls through the ENTRANCE GATE at the NASA LANGLEY
          RESEARCH CENTER. He retrieves his BADGE from the dashboard
          and shows it to the guard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          EXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur's car drives down MAIN STREET on the campus of the
          research center. The buildings are predominately drab,
          functional, one story brick structures.. surrounded by
          various GLOBE STRUCTURES and PIPE NETWORKS on manicured green
          lawns.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

          The CAMERA tracks with Arthur as he moves through the crowded
          corridor of one of the research buildings. He says hello to
          various colleagues along the way.
          All of the men at the facility are dressed the same... with
          white shirts and TIES and POCKET PROTECTOR BADGES. The place
          resembles an all-male community college for young scientists.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MEDIA ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur eases his way into the small, crowded AUDITORIUM that
          serves as a MEDIA ROOM. A PRESS CONFERENCE is underway.
          NORM CAHILL ( 40s), the VIKING PROJECT COORDINATOR, is
           standing at the podium. Next to him is an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR
          with maps and various schematics projected from it onto a

          LARGE SCREEN.

                         REPORTER #1
          It's been five months since the
          Viking lander touched down on the
          surface of Mars. We've seen dozens
          of photographs of the rock covered
          surface... what can you now tell us
          about the tests you've been
          conducting? Is there any sign of
          life on the red planet?
          Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium.

                         CAHILL
          Well... there are three separate
          tests that we've been conducting...
          Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release
          and Gas Exchange. The first two
          tests, based on soil samples about
          22 centimeters deep, came back
          negative... and the third is...
          still pending.
          Cahill smiles. Laughter erupts from various parts of the
          auditorium.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         REPORTER #1
          Can you elaborate on test number
          three?
          Cahill places a transparent MAP of the mars surface on the
          overhead projector and begins to draw on it with a WAX

          PENCIL.

                         CAHILL
          The gas exchange experiment
          measures the production or uptake
          of C02, nitrogen, methane,
          hydrogen, and oxygen during the
          incubation of the martian soil
          sample.

                         REPORTER #2
          Are you showing us all of the
          photos? Are there little green men
          up there?
          Laughter from the press.

                         CAHILL
          Well... there is a possibility that
          the planet abounds with chemical
          compounds produced by living
          systems. Their chemical nature,
          distribution and structural
          uniqueness could be used to argue
          the presence of microscopic living
          organisms on Mars.
          As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the
          reporter on the shoulder.

                         ARTHUR
          It all comes down to water.
          Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia
          Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity
          of the site where VIKING II landed.
          There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.

                         ARTHUR (CONT-D)
          If we find water beneath the
          surface... and the topographic maps
          of Utopia Planitia indicate that
          there were once rivers on the
          surface of the planet, it's
          possible that we'll eventually find
          evidence of life.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATER

          The OWL PELLET FILM is underway. Norma sits in the back of
          the class next to the projector. She crosses her legs...
          reaching for her foot... massaging it gently. She cringes...
          clearly in intense pain.
          Charles looks back at her... noticing this. They make eye
          contact... and Charles turns back to the screen.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CAHILL'S OFFICE -- MORNING

          Arthur now sits across from Cahill in his office. Behind him
          is a window that overlooks a huge laboratory.

                         CAHILL
          I'm sorry Arthur, but they've
          denied your application to be
          admitted into the astronaut
          program.
          Arthur looks crushed.

                         ARTHUR
          I see.

                         (BEAT)
          Can I ask why?

                         CAHILL
          I'm sorry, son... but they don't
          tell us why.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- LATER ON

          The CAMERA tracks through a LARGE LABORATORY in the heart of
          one of the main buildings on the Langley campus.
          Work tables assembled with LABORATORY EQUIPMENT and MACHINERY
          extend out into infinity as DOZENS OF YOUNG MEN, all dressed
          in similar white shirts with NASA ID BADGES move throughout,
          engaged in various tasks.
          Arthur is standing at a LABORATORY TABLE with a WHITE MASK
          on. He is wearing a LAB COAT and GLASSES.
          He pours PINK LIQUID onto the surface of a METAL PAN...
          filling it to the edges.
          A colleague named WENDELL JAMES ( 29) walks over to see what
          he is doing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         ARTHUR
          Are they really with-holding some
          of the Mars photos?

                         WENDELL
          I don't know, man. Jesus... what's
          that smell?

                         ARTHUR
          It's a salinic compound.

                         WENDELL
          What are you making?

                         ARTHUR
          Christmas present for Norma.
          Arthur retrieves a WHITE CERAMIC MOLD. The mold has an
          extrusion that is shaped like a WOMAN'S FOOT... only the end
          of the foot is round and missing its toes, save for the PINKY

          TOE.

                         WENDELL
          A new prosthesis for her foot?

                         ARTHUR
          Yep.
          Arthur carefully impresses the MOLD of his wife's foot into
          the pink goop... sealing the mold at the edges into the tray.

                         WENDELL
          What did you change up this time?

                         ARTHUR
          The compound they're developing for
          the pilot chairs on the space
          shuttle.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT

          INSERT: The BONES of a FIELD MOUSE have been re-assembled in
          rough form within the tray... as the OWL PELLET has been
          ripped apart.
          The tray belongs to Charles, and he has grown tired of
          dissecting the owl pellet.
          He looks up to the head of the class and sees that Norma is
          sitting up on her desk... filing her nails... waiting out the
          last remaining minutes of the period.

                         CHARLES
          Mrs. Lewis?

          She raises her head.

                         NORMA
          Hmmm?

                         CHARLES
          What happened to your foot?
          She just stares at him.

                         NORMA
          What happened... to my foot?

                         CHARLES
          Yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          My friend... she saw you take your
          shoe off. She said... that there's
          something wrong with it.
          The whole class goes silent. Norma begins to blush. She looks
          down at her right foot, hidden inside of a CLOSED-TOE SHOE.

                         NORMA
          Well... it's a long story.
          She looks at her watch.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          We've got five minutes until second
          period.
          She looks back at her class and sees that their curiosity has
          been piqued. She has no choice now but to tell them.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Alright... I'll tell you what
          happened to my foot.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT

          Arthur sits at the table with Wendell... waiting for the MOLD
          to dry. Arthur is dealing a deck of cards as they begin a
          game of GIN RUMMY.

                         ARTHUR
          When she was seventeen... still
          living in Texas, her brother
          dropped a barbell on her foot...
          broke three of her toes.

          The CAMERA pans across the faces of STUDENTS as they listen
          to her tell the story.

                         NORMA
          And so I go to see the doctor. He
          goes to take an X-ray of my foot to
          see if the bones are broken.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT

          Arthur discards... then retrieves a replacement card from the
          stack.

                         ARTHUR
          So this dumb-ass Richmond doctor
          takes the x-ray... then he goes to
          check on another patient down the
          hall.
          Arthur discards a king.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          This dumb--ass... he left the x-ray
          machine on.

                         WENDELL
          Jesus. That's not good.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT

          Norma raises up her right shoe to show the class.

                         NORMA
          They found out that the tissue in
          four of my toes had been completely

                         I
          destroyed by the radiation.
          Norma swivels around on the desk and places her right foot
          against her left inner thigh.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          So they have to amputate four of my
          toes. And then they had to take a
          bunch of skin from my inner thigh
          to cover the front of my foot. This
          is back in 1963... so they didn't
          have the skin graft techniques they
          do now.

          INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT

          Arthur stands up and takes his RIGHT FOOT... pulls it up and
          touches it to his LEFT INNER THIGH.

                         ARTHUR
          She had to sit there in a hospital
          bed in the same position for six
          months, waiting for it to heal.
          Wendell stares at the mold on the laboratory table.

                         WENDELL
          Jesus. I hope she sued this idiot.

                         ARTHUR
          Oh yeah. Her family sued. They won.

                         WENDELL
          What was the settlement?

                         ARTHUR
          Forty thousand dollars.
          Arthur pulls the ceramic mold out of the pink goop... and we
          see the IMPRESSION of her disfigured foot inside the new

          PROSTHESIS.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT

          Norma turns around and uncrosses her legs. They now dangle
          over the edge of the lab desk.

                         NORMA
          You guys want to see it? Now that
          the secret is out... I don't want
          you spreading rumors about my

          Come on... gather round... take a
          look at the freak show.
          As the kids gather around... Norma removes her right shoe and
          reveals her disfigured foot... missing every toe but her
          pinky. A rounded piece of SCAR TISSUE covers the rest of it.

                         WALTER
          It doesn't look gross... it looks

                         NORMA
          Hey honey.

                         WALTER
          Why do I need a baby-sitter?

                         NORMA
          Because you're nine years old.
          You're not a geezer yet.

          It's 1976, mom. Times are changing.
          Nine years old isn't what it used
          to be. I think I'm ready to get a
          moped.

                         NORMA
          We're not buying you a moped,
          Walter. Stick with the bike... and
          be home before dark.

          Arthur emerges from a NASA CAMPUS GYMNASIUM into the twilight
          with Wendell. Both are covered in sweat, dressed in gym
          clothes. Arthur is carrying his BASKETBALL and a gym bag.

                         WENDELL
          How's the commute back to Richmond?

                         ARTHUR
          Not too bad. Maybe an hour and
          twenty minutes.

                         WENDELL
          Tell Norma I said hello.
          Wendell watches him walk across the lawn to the parking
          lot... approaching his car. He lights a cigarette and takes a
          drag... then looks at his watch.
          INSERT: His watch shows that it is 4:58 PM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

          Norma sits on the couch... smoking a CIGARETTE. On the
          TELEVISION... the LOCAL NEWS is playing.
          The DOORBELL rings.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          Norma opens the front door.
          A man named ARLINGTON STEWARD (40) is standing there, his
          body is turned in profile. He is wearing a crisp wool suit
          and a BLACK HAT, with a BRIEFCASE in his right hand.

                         ARLINGTON
          Mrs. Lewis?

                         NORMA
          Yeah.

                         ARLINGTON
          My name is Arlington Steward.
          Her eyes light up, as she remembers the name and the box.
          Arlington then rotates his body... revealing the RIGHT SIDE
          of his face. Norma's eyes widen in horror at what she sees.
          Nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone
          to his lower jaw has been burned away. His rear MOLARS and
          GUMS are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is
          supposed to conceal them.
          Norma immediately feels a strange connection... a deep
          sympathy for him and the pain he must have endured.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT-D)
          I assume you received the box that
          I left on your doorstep.
          His speech has a slight impediment from the burn that extends
          to the right side of his mouth.

                         NORMA
          Oh, yes. Yes we did.

                         ARLINGTON
          And you retrieved the button unit
          inside of the box.
          Norma smiles. He smiles back at her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         NORMA
          The button unit. That's what you
          call it?

                         ARLINGTON
          Indeed. May I come in?

                         NORMA
          Sure.
          Norma turns and leads him back into the kitchen. She
          retrieves the button unit from the table.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          So what it this thing? I assume
          you're trying to sell me something?

                         ARLINGTON
          Well... in a way, yes. I do have an
          offer to make.

                         NORMA
          Yeah? What are you selling?

                         ARLINGTON
          A financial opportunity.
          Arlington gestures toward the table with his briefcase.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          May I?
          She nods. He places the briefcase down on the table.
          He takes the button unit from her and sets it down on the
          kitchen table. They both sit down.
          He then withdraws a SMALL YELLOW ENVELOPE from his suit
          jacket pocket.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          inside of this envelope is a key.
          Arlington opens the envelope and withdraws a small METAL KEY.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          This is the key that opens the
          glass dome of the button unit.
          Arlington then inserts the key into a small HORIZONTAL SLOT
          at the top edge. He turns the key, and the LID that houses
          the GLASS DOME pops lose.
          The METAL BUTTON is now exposed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          If you push the button, one of two
          things will happen.

                         (BEAT)
          First, someone... somewhere in the
          world... who you do not know...
          will die.
          Norma just stares at him.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Then, you will receive a payment of
          two-hundred thousand dollars... tax
          free.
          Arlington opens the briefcase. Inside are neatly stacked rows
          of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          The money will be delivered to you
          in cash.
          Norma covers her mouth... shocked at the sight of so much
          money.

                         NORMA
          Are you for real?
          Arlington smiles back at her.

                         ARLINGTON
          Mrs. Lewis, I can assure you that
          the offer is real.

                         NORMA
          Who do you work for?

                         ARLINGTON
          The guarantee of payment has
          several restrictions. One... I am
          not permitted to disclose any
          information about to the identity
          of my employers.

                         (BEAT)
          Two... if you discuss the details
          of this financial opportunity with
          anyone other than your husband, the
          offer is null and void, and you
          will not receive the money in
          return for having pushed the
          button.

                         (BEAT)
          Three... you have twenty four
          hours.
          Arlington glances at his watch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          You have until five o'clock
          tomorrow evening to make your
          decision whether or not to push the
          button. At that time, I will return
          to retrieve the button unit from
          you. It will be re-programmed and
          the offer will be made to someone
          else.
          Arlington places the key back into the envelope, seals it
          with crisp precision, and hands it over to her.
          He then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Until then... a good day to you,
          Mrs. Lewis.
          He nods his head and turns toward the foyer.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          She follows him toward the front door.

                         NORMA
          Wait a minute... you're just going
          to leave me with this thing.

                         (BAFFLED)
          Is this some kind of joke? Who are
          you?
          He opens the front door and turns back to her with a friendly
          smile.

                         ARLINGTON
          My name is Arlington Steward, and I
          can assure you that this is no
          joke. The offer is real, but I am
          not at liberty to disclose any more
          information than I already have.
          He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Good day.
          He heads down the walk toward his car.
          She looks down at the card and sees that his name is printed
          in an embossed BLACK FONT:

                         ARLINGTON STEWARD

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          She turns the card over and sees what looks like a PHONE
          NUMBER printed on the back:

                         8 0 4 7 9 4 1 7 7 9
          She stands there in the doorway and watches him step into the
          automobile, start the engine and drive off.

          EXT. CARYTOWN SHOPPING CENTER -- AFTERNOON

          Walter is sitting on a bench in front of a line of shops in
          CARYTOWN. Dana approaches him.
          He turns to face her.

                         WALTER
          What do you want?

                         DANA
          I'm sorry. I just wanted to tell
          you... that I think your mom is
          beautiful.
          Walter just stares at her in silence... wanting to forgive
          her.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma walks back into the kitchen, holding the key envelope
          in one hand and the business card in the other.
          She stares at them both, then down at the box. She then
          retrieves the key from the envelope and inserts it into the
          slot, opening the glass dome.
          She stares at the button for a long moment... then closes the
          dome. She closes her eyes... trying to make sense of what has
          just transpired.

          INT. BURNS HOUSE -- NEXT

          The CAMERA zooms out from a RINGING PHONE that sits on a
          KITCHEN COUNTER in a large suburban house. SUSAN BURNS (50s)
          goes to answer the phone.

                         SUSAN
          Hello?

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          Hey mom.

                         SUSAN
          Hey honey. What's up?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          Nothing... I just...
           The CAMERA continues to zoom out, revealing her husband, JIM
          BURNS (50s) laid out in a recliner, watching television.

                         SUSAN
          Is something wrong?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma stares at the business card.

                         NORMA
          No... something just happened
          and...

                         SUSAN (PHONE)
          What?

                         NORMA
          Nothing. I don't want to talk about
          it right now.

          INT. BURNS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

          Susan carries the phone into the family room

                         SUSAN
          Alright.
          (covering the phone)
          Jim... you gotta get ready.

                         JIM
          Alright.
          He sits up and moves toward the stairs.

                         SUSAN
          Wait until you see the spread
          tonight.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma twirls the phone cord around her finger.

                         NORMA
          Hmmm. I think they're spending more
          on their wedding than we did on our
          house.

                         SUSAN (PHONE)
          Is your foot acting up again?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          Norma leans against the wall... lifting her right foot off
          the floor to ease the pain.

                         NORMA
          A little, yeah. That damn bone. The
          skin from my leg, it's not as tough
          as it should be.

                         SUSAN (PHONE)
          You know he's gonna be there
          tonight.

                         NORMA
          Who?

                         SUSAN
          Dr. Stupid.
          Norma takes this in... remembering...

                         NORMA
          Well... it's been what... thirteen
          years? Bound to run into each other
          at some point, right?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BATHROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma is now wearing only her BRA AND PANTIES, her hair and
          make-up flawless. She finishes putting on a pair of DIAMOND

          EARRINGS.
          As she steps into an elegant COCKTAIL DRESS... we see the
          deep square shaped SCARS on the inside of her LEFT THIGH.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Norma comes into the bedroom... and ARTHUR is there...
          putting on his CUFF LINKS. He is dressed in a TUXEDO.
          His jacket is laid out on the bed, and next to it is his
          CHRISTMAS PRESENT. Norma sees it.

                         NORMA
          What's this?

                         ARTHUR
          A little gift from Dr. Rex Morgan.
          She opens the present and retrieves the PROSTHESIS.

                         NORMA
          Oh my god!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Norma removes an old, store-bought INSOLE from her right shoe
          and inserts the new one.

                         ARTHUR
          It's a material they developed for
          the new shuttle chairs. It'll
          absorb the pressure of your foot
          and re-distribute it across the
          entire surface area.
          She then slides her disfigured foot into the shoe... and
          begins to walk around the room.

                         NORMA
          Oh my God, Rex... how'd you do it?

                         ARTHUR
          I just figured out a way to make it
          better.
          She crosses the room and gives him a hug and a kiss.

                         NORMA
          I don't know what I'd do without
          you.

                         ARTHUR
          Merry Christmas, June.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma and Arthur come into the family room, wearing their
          winter coats. Walter is sitting across the coffee table with
          Dana. They are playing CARDS.
          The box is sitting between them.

                         WALTER
          Did Mr. Steward show up?
          Norma sees the box sitting there and immediately grabs it off
          the table.

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah... what's it all about. Did he
          show up?

                         NORMA
          Yeah... I'll tell you about it in
          the car. We're running late.
          Norma leans down and kisses Walter on the cheek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          We'll be home late... your bedtime
          is ten.
          Dana watches them go... her eyes transfixed on the box in
          Norma's hands.

          EXT. RIVER ROAD -- NIGHT

          The CAMERA tracks with Arthur's car as it drives south on
          CARY STREET... approaching an intersection.

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT

          Norma has the box sitting in her lap while Arthur drives.

                         NORMA
          And before I could ask him anything
          else... he got in his car... and he
          pulled off.

                         ARTHUR
          Did you get the license plate?

                         NORMA
          No.

                         ARTHUR
          Your dad is cop, Norma. Always get
          the license plate number.

                         NORMA
          I was little overwhelmed, Arthur.

                         ARTHUR
          Somewhere in the world... someone
          you do not know will die.

                         NORMA
          Those were his exact words.

                         ARTHUR
          Did he say how they would die?

                         NORMA
          No.

                         ARTHUR
          And he showed you the cash.

                         NORMA
          Yeah. He said it was two-hundred
          thousand. It looked real to me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         ARTHUR
          What did he look like?

                         NORMA
          You don't want to know. I think
          he's a burn victim. Poor thing...
          half of his face is gone.

                         ARTHUR
          Really?

                         NORMA
          I think maybe he's a life insurance
          salesman. Maybe that's what it is.
          It's some kind of survey. We push
          the button and he offers us a
          discount on a two-hundred thousand
          dollar life insurance policy.
          Joke's on us.

          EXT. COUNTRY CLUB OF VIRGINIA -- NIGHT

          The CAMERA descends upon the COUNTRY CLUB OF VIRGINIA. It is
          a MASSIVE COLONIAL MANSION that sits upon a huge hill that is
          littered with CHRISTMAS LUMINARIES that glow in the night.

          EXT. C.C.V. -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

          We approach Arthur's car as they pull into a PARKING SPACE in
          front of the main entrance.

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT

          Arthur grabs the box from off her lap.

                         ARTHUR
          Did you bring the key with you?
          She hands it to him.
          He takes the key and inserts it... opening the glass dome.
          He then takes his INDEX FINGER and places it on the button.

                         NORMA
          What the hell are you doing?!

                         ARTHUR

                         (PLAYFUL)
          I was gonna push the button.

                         NORMA
          No!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Norma reaches over and snaps the dome closed.

                         ARTHUR
          You think it's for real.
          She takes the box back from him.

                         NORMA
          I don't know. He was... he seemed
          very sure of himself. If it's some
          kind of survey... then... he's a
          really good salesman because I
          believe him. I believe that he
          might give us that money.

                         ARTHUR
          Do then you think he's a maniac and
          he might go kill someone?

                         NORMA
          I don't know.
          Arthur takes the box back from her. He shakes it... then
          flips it over. He sees that there is a SINGLE SCREW on the
          bottom corner that holds it together.

                         ARTHUR
          Open the glove compartment. There's
          a philips head screwdriver in
          there.
          She opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT and retrieves a PHILLIPS HEAD
          SCREWDRIVER for him.

                         NORMA
          What are you doing?
          Arthur is now unscrewing the bottom of the box.

                         ARTHUR
          I'm gonna see what's inside of it.
          He removes the screw... and sees that the wooden base rotates
          on a ROD MOUNT on the opposite corner.
          INSIDE... it is completely empty.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Nothing... no transmitter... no
          radio. If we pushed the button
          right now... he'd have no way of
          knowing.
          She takes the box from him and closes the dome.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          EXT. C.C.V. -- PARI:ING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur pops open the trunk and Norma places the box inside.
          He shuts the trunk and they begin to walk toward the entrance
          to the COUNTRY CLUB. Arthur then holds out his hand to his
          wife.

                         ARTHUR
          Let me hold the key.

                         NORMA
          Why do you get to hold it?

                         ARTHUR
          Because you'll lose it Norma. You
          can't hold your liquor.

                         NORMA
          Neither can you.

                         ARTHUR
          What if someone takes your purse? I
          have pockets. Let me hold it.

                         NORMA
          Fine.
          Norma goes through her purse and hands the small envelope to
          him. They move toward the entrance to the country club.

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          The CAMERA follows Norma and Arthur into the GRAND BALLROOM
          of the country club. There are several hundred people
          there... all dressed in black tie. A MASSIVE CHRISTMAS TREE
          sits in the center of the room, surrounded by tables.
          A PIANO PLAYER plays CHRISTMAS CAROLS up on the stage.

                         NORMA
          Jesus. All this for a rehearsal
          dinner... Deborah is so lucky.
          Remember our rehearsal dinner?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah. Keg party in our back yard.
           Susan and Jim are standing with ARTHUR LEWIS, SR (50s) and
          BEV LEWIS ( 50s). Arthur and Norma go over to greet them.
           The CAMERA drifts over to a PLACARD that reads:

           DEBORAH ANNE BURNS - EDWARD REED POWELL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          REHEARSAL DINNER RECEPTION

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

          Dana enters the family room and hands a package to Walter.

                         DANA
          Merry Christmas...
          Walter takes the package and begins to remove the wrapping
          paper.
          Inside is a COMIC BOOK. He pulls it out of the wrapping...
          and on the cover is an illustration of a DARK FIGURE walking
          upon a RED DESERT SURFACE.
          The title is: THE MAN FROM MARS
          Walter looks at the cover in awe.

                         WALTER
          Thanks Dana. My dad is gonna love
          this.

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma and Arthur are now seated around a table with both sets
          of parents. Bev is running her hand through Arthur's long
          hair.

                         BEV
          When are you gonna cut this hair?

                         ARTHUR
          Never.

                         BEV

                         (TO NORMA)
          Are you still cutting his hair?

                         NORMA
          Uh-huh.

          ARTHUR SR.
          Are you Leonard or Skynard?

                         BEV
          Well honey... they're never gonna
          let you into outer space with these
          sideburns.

                         SUSAN
          They're all wearing them that way
          now, Bev.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          NATHAN BURNS ( 26), Norma's wheelchair-bound younger brother,
          comes rolling up.

                         NATHAN
          Outer space? Is someone planning on
          departing the surface of the earth?

                         ARTHUR
          Nathan!
          Arthur stands up and gives him a hug.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          It's been years. How have you been?

                         NATHAN
          I've been better... I mean, I used
          to have legs...
          The table goes silent... Susan looks as though she might
          start to cry.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry... morbid humor. What's this
          talk about outer space?

                         NORMA
          Arthur has been working at Nasa.

                         JIM
          He helped design the camera that
          photographed the Mars surface.
          Arthur puts his hands on the back of Nathan's wheelchair.

                         ARTHUR
          Nathan and I are gonna go grab a
          drink...
          He begins to wheel Nathan toward the bar.

                         NORMA
          Arthur made me a new prosthesis for
          my foot. Some space age formula...
          it's incredible.

                         JIM
          Can he make Nathan a pair of
          prosthetic legs?

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur now sits with Nathan over by the bar.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         NATHAN
          Can you believe it? I survive
          eighteen months crawlling through
          the Vietnam jungle and not one
          bullet so much as grazes my body.

                         (BEAT)
          And I come home, take a few tabs of
          LSD at a Grateful Dead show and
          wrap my car around a tree.
          Arthur doesn't know how to respond.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Pretty damn sad... losing the legs
          that way, but I always thought it
          was Karmic retribution for what I
          did to Norma.

                         ARTHUR
          What'd you ever do to Norma?

                         NATHAN
          I dropped that barbell on her foot
          when we were kids. That's why she
          went to get that x-ray. If it
          wasn't for me... she'd still have
          all her toes.

                         ARTHUR
          You can't think of it that way.

                         NATHAN
          Why not? It's the truth.

                         ARTHUR
          You didn't leave the x-ray machine
          on, Dr. Stupid did.

                         NATHAN
          Yeah, but my mistake sent her to
          Dr. Stupid... so that makes me
          culpable in the eyes of Buddha.

                         ARTHUR
          You're no more culpable than the
          company that manufactured the
          barbell. Stop punishing yourself.
          Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack
          Daniels.

                         NATHAN
          You know he's here.

                         ARTHUR
          Who?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         NATHAN
          Dr. Stupid.
          Nathan nods his head across the room... where DR. EARL STUPE
          ( 50s) is seated at a table with his wife.

                          NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Dr. Earl Stupe. He's still got a
          practice over on the west end.
          Arthur looks over at him... for a moment they make brief eye
          contact... and Stupe quickly looks away.

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- NEXT

          Susan is now staring at Dr. Stupe. They are joined by DEBORAH
          BURNS (24), Norma's younger sister and bride-to-be.

                         SUSAN
          I wonder if he even recognizes us.

                         JIM
          I'm sure he does.

                         DEBORAH
          I can't believe they still let him
          practice medicine.

                         NORMA
          You gotta let it go. You gotta
          learn to forgive and forget.

                         SUSAN
          I'd be willing to forgive him if he
          would've just admitted his
          negligence under oath. The bastard
          lied... said it was the x-ray
          machine that malfunctioned.
          SENATOR GRIFFITH POWELL (50s) and his son EDWARD POWELL
          ( 20s), approach. Edward is the husband-to-be.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
          Well Senator! You look very spiffy
          tonight!

                         POWELL
          Now that the mid-term elections are
          over... the smile lines are
          starting to fade.
          Powell puts on a fake smile, grabs Jim's hand and they both
          wave... poking fun at politician behavior.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         SUSAN
          Well... we all voted!
          Powell looks over at Norma.

                         POWELL
          Norma... right?

                         NORMA
          That's right.
          He shakes her hand... fascinated by her.

                         POWELL
          And you're married to the aspiring
          astronaut.

                         NORMA
          That's right. There he is right
          over there.
          She points over to Arthur the bar. Powell looks over at
          him... and they briefly make eye contact.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

          Dana and Walter are sitting on the floor, playing MONOPOLY.

                         DANA
          Walter?

                         WALTER
          Yeah?

                         DANA
          Will you take me down to the
          basement? I want to see your dad's
          darkroom.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- BASEMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

          Dana and Walter come down the stairs into the BASEMENT of the
          house. RED LIGHT envelops the room. There are two long wooden
          WORK BENCHES running down the middle.
          There are a series of BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS hanging
          from a wire. Each one shows a different view of the surface
          of MARS.

                         DANA
          Is that Mars?

                         WALTER
          Yep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         DANA
          What did your dad have to do with
          the Viking?

                         WALTER
          He helped design the camera.
          Walter points to a PLASTIC PROTOTYPE MODEL of the VIKING
          LANDER mounted on a third WORK BENCH at the end of the room.
          A model of the MARS SURFACE has been re-created and painted
          with exacting detail.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          He's making the model for the
          science museum.
          Walter points to one of TWO CAMERAS mounted on the front of
          the SPIDER-SHAPED LANDING MODULE. The camera is cylindrical
          and features a VERTICAL SLOT on the front.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          They designed the camera to
          photograph in 360 degrees. It scans
          in the image one line at a time...
          and takes about five minutes to
          complete one revolution.

                         DANA
          How do they get the images back to
          earth?

                         WALTER
          Radio transmission. They figured
          out a way to interpret the scan
          lines and then print them onto
          film.

                         DANA
          How long does it take to transmit
          back to earth?

                         WALTER
          About ten hours.
          Dana looks over at the wall and sees a NEW YORK TIMES FRONT
          PAGE from September with a large image of MARS on it.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          They tested the camera in the
          parking lot at Langley last year.
          Walter points to another FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. In
          the black & white photograph, we see a group of FIFTY NASA
          EMPLOYEES assembled in a long line in a PARKING LOT.
          Walter points to his father standing in the group.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          There's my dad.
          He moves his finger across the line of smiling faces...
          ARTHUR appears for a SECOND TIME in the row.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          And there he is again.
          Walter then moves his finger down toward the right side of
          the photo... ARTHUR LEWIS appears for a third time.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          And there he is again.
          Dana looks close at the photo.

                         DANA
          How'd he do that?

                         WALTER
          Because the camera takes five
          minutes to scan in 360 degrees, he
          waited until the camera passed over
          him then jumped ahead in the
          circle.
          The CAMERA moves in closer to the photograph... to the THIRD
          VERSION of ARTHUR LEWIS.

                         DANA
          Your dad sounds pretty clever.

                         WALTER
          My dad is more than just clever,
          Dana. My dad is the coolest man who
          ever walked the face of the earth.
          The CAMERA ZOOMS in close to Arthur's face... then tips down
          to another MAN kneeling on the pavement directly below him.
          It is ARLINGTON STEWARD... smiling at the camera. His face is
          normal... no evidence of any burn visible...

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

          Norma and Arthur are now DANCING among a group of people in
          front of the stage the stage, where a WOMAN SINGER is
          performing WHITE CHRISTMAS.

                         NORMA
          Two-hundred thousand dollars is a
          lot of money, Arthur.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         ARTHUR
          What would we do with that kind of
          money?

                         NORMA
          We could get out of Richmond...
          move to California.

                         ARTHUR
          Then we could cross the border into
          Mexico if they ever came after us.

                         NORMA
          You can't arrest someone for
          pushing a button, Arthur. It's not
          a weapon. It's not a gun. We
          wouldn't be culpable... not in a
          court of law.

                         ARTHUR
          What if it's someone's baby?

                         NORMA
          What if it's some murderer on death
          row in China?

                         ARTHUR
          What if it's our neighbor across
          the street. Do you know our
          neighbors across the street? Have
          you ever met them?

                         NORMA
          Yeah. Doug and Donna.

                         ARTHUR
          Hmmm. I haven't met Doug or Donna.

                         (BEAT)
          What does it mean to officially
          know someone, anyway? Do you know
          me, Norma?

                         NORMA
          I know you better than you know
          yourself.

                         ARTHUR
          Do you know Walter?

                         NORMA
          Even better than I know you.
          They spin around on the dance floor.

                         ARTHUR
          It's just a stupid prank, Norma.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         NORMA
          Life insurance.
          Arthur gazes across the ballroom toward the bar. Nathan sits
          there alone... finishing his drink.

          EXT. C.C.V. -- PARKING LOT --LATER THAT NIGHT

          Arthur and Norma watch as Jim hoists Nathan up into their VAN
          with a HYDRAULIC LIFT. He is passed out drunk.
          Behind him... Dr. Stupe is waiting in line at the valet for
          his car. He and Norma make eye contact. His eyes dart down to
          the pavement as he steps into his car.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma and Arthur come into the family room. Dana is asleep on
          the couch. Norma sets the box down on the coffee table and
          goes to wake Dana.

                         NORMA
          Dana...
          Dana's eyes slowly open.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Arthur will drive you home, okay?

                         DANA
          I have my bike... and my house
          isn't far from here.

                         NORMA
          Where's Walter?

                         DANA
          He's asleep upstairs.
          Arthur hands Dana a ten dollar bill.

                         ARTHUR
          Are you sure you don't need a ride?

                         DANA
          I'm sure.

                         ARTHUR
          Good night, Dana.
          Dana exits through the front door. Norma stands up and moves
          toward the foyer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         NORMA
          Can you turn off the Christmas tree
          lights?

                         ARTHUR
          I like leaving them on.

                         NORMA
          It's a fire hazard.

                         ARTHUR
          It keeps the Christmas spirit alive
          while we sleep.

                         NORMA
          We could die.

                         ARTHUR
          Everyone dies eventually, Norma.
          She stares at the tree.

                         NORMA
          Fine. Leave them on.
          She goes upstairs... leaving him alone with the glowing tree.
          Arthur looks down at the coffee table. The box sits there...
          taunting him. He retrieves the KEY ENVELOPE from his pocket
          and stares at it.
          He then walks over to the wall and unplugs the Christmas tree
          lights.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

          Norma and Arthur lay in bed, facing in opposite directions.
          Neither of them can sleep.
          Arthur rolls over and wraps his arm around her.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- WALTER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT

          The CAMERA approaches Walter's bed. He has made a TENT under
          the covers. A light glows from inside.
          UNDER THE COVERS... Walter has a flashlight and he is reading
          the comic book.
          INSERT: Various illustrations from the comic... a HUGE TEMPLE
          with a massive flying beast flying above it. A METEOR
          hurtling toward EARTH...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          ::WT. CARYTOWN E.kT-R S -LO1 -- EARLY MORNING
          At the CARYTOWN HAIR SALON... the CAMERA zooms out from Norma
          as she sits under a DOME, drying her hair. Next to her is her
          sister Deborah and several other BRIDESMAIDS for the wedding.
          The other women are gabbing... reading fashion magazines.
          Norma seems lost in her own world.

          EXT. CARYTOWN HAIR SALON -- LATER ON

          Norma and Deborah emerge from the hair salon with the others
          in tow. Lurking down at the end of the sidewalk is Bud Wall,
          Walter's bus-driver.
          The huge man watches them intensely.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma has Arlington's BUSINESS CARD out. She stares at the
          number. Arthur comes in with the morning paper.
          The box sits on the kitchen table. She retrieves the key and
          inserts it into the slot... opening the glass dome. Arthur
          comes into the kitchen.

                         NORMA
          We'll never see that much money.

                         ARTHUR
          Why do you say that?

                         NORMA
          Be realistic Arthur... you work for
          the government.

                         ARTHUR
          Maybe not forever.

                         NORMA
          We'll never leave Richmond.

                         ARTHUR
          Do you want to move?

                         NORMA
          We have to put Walter in public
          school.

                         ARTHUR
          Why?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          Collegiate withdrew the faculty
          tuition discount.

          No...

                         NORMA
          Yeah. They did.

                         (BEAT)
          Even if we sold my car and moved
          into a smaller house, we couldn't
          afford that school.

                         ARTHUR
          No...

                         NORMA
          We'd have to enroll him at
          Hopewell. Unless...

                         ARTHUR
          Unless what, Norma?
          She reaches out and holds her finger over the button...
          thinking. She then picks up the business card with her other
          hand, flips it over and stares at the number.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Are you gonna call him?

                         NORMA
          Yeah.
          Norma begins to dial the number on the card.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- NEXT

          The CAMERA cranes down into the WILLOW LAWN MOTEL on the
          north side of Richmond. The two-story building has a SWIMMING
          POOL adjacent to south side.

          INT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- ROOM 234 -- NEXT

          The CAMERA zooms out from a RINGING TELEPHONE that sits on
          the bedside table.
          Arlington sits on the bed... staring silently at the wall. He
          picks up the receiver and places it to his ear.

                         ARLINGTON
          Hello Mrs. Lewis.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma pauses for a moment... wondering how he could have
          known it was her.

                         NORMA
          Is this Mr. Steward?

                         ARLINGTON (PHONE)
          Of course it is.

                         NORMA
          How did you know it was me... are
          you tracing this call?

                         ARLINGTON (PHONE)
          Time is running out... have you
          made your decision?
          Norma looks to Arthur... who paces around the kitchen.

                         NORMA
          If we push the button... are you
          going to murder someone?

          INT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- ROOM 234 -- NEXT

          Arlington leans back on the motel room bed.

                         ARLINGTON
          When you push the button...
          somewhere in this world... someone
          you do not know... will die. I
          never mentioned the word murder.

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          How will they die?

                         ARLINGTON
          I'm not at liberty to disclose that
          information. Besides... it would
          spoil the fun.

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          Are you selling life insurance?

                         ARLINGTON
          I am not at liberty to disclose any
          information about my employers. I
          can only remind you that the offer
          is real...

          .and it expires in approximately
          eight hours.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         NORMA (PHONE)
          Why do you do this? What do you get
          out of this deal?

                         ARLINGTON
          Absolutely nothing. The reward is
          for you.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma paces around with the phone.

                         ARLINGTON (PHONE)
          Is there anything else, Mrs. Lewis?
          I have an appointment to make and I
          don't want to be late.

                         NORMA
          Can we meet in person? I'd like to
          see you... before we make our final
          decision.

                         ARLINGTON
          Why... I'm looking at you right
          now, Norma.

                         NORMA
          Excuse me?

                         ARLINGTON
          The grey spotted owl... in your
          back yard.
          Norma turns and looks out the large picture window in the
          kitchen nook. Outside in the back yard, an OWL is perched on
          a planter.
          The large bird sits motionless... its large SAUCER EYES do
          not blink.
          Norma stares at it for a long moment... transfixed. Arthur
          paces around the kitchen... facing in the other direction.
          Outside... the owl flies away before Arthur notices it.

                         NORMA
          Hello?
          There is no response.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Mr. Steward? Are you still there?
          Norma hangs up the phone. She stares at the box... then at
          her husband, as he sits down across from her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         ARTHUR
          What do you want to do Norma?

                         NORMA
          We're gonna have to pull Walter out
          of that school.

                         ARTHUR
          Then push it.

                         (TAUNTING)
          Push the button, Norma... push the
          button. I dare you. I double-dog
          diddly dare you.

                         NORMA
          I'm scared to.

                         ARTHUR
          Well... if you don't push it...
          then I will.

                         (BEAT)
          This is stupid.
          Arthur reaches out to push the button... but she grabs his
          wrist with her left hand, restraining him.

                         NORMA
          Ladies first.
          She then reaches out and presses down on the button with her
          index finger.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- 911 EMERGENCY -- NEXT

          The CAMERA tracks along a series of CUBICLES at the POLICE
          STATION in downtown Richmond. A FEMALE OPERATOR sits at each
          cubicle...

                         OPERATOR #1
          911 emergency... how may I direct
          your call?
          The CAMERA moves in closer...

                         OPERATOR #1 (CONT'D)
          Excuse me? You need to slow down...
          I can't understand what you're
          saying.
          She listens to the voice on the other end of the line.

                         OPERATOR #1 (CONT'D)
          So you heard loud screaming and
          then a gun shot.

                          OPERATOR #1 (CONT'D)
           What is your address?

                         (BEAT)
          1500 Cary Street.

          EXT. 1500 CARY STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

          Two POLICE CARS pull up with their SIRENS blaring in front of
          a TOWNHOUSE on Cary Street. TWO POLICE OFFICERS emerge from
          each car and approach the front of the townhouse.
          They begin to bang loudly on the door. A FEMALE NEIGHBOR
          (20s) emerges from the townhouse next door.

                         NEIGHBOR

                         (DISTRAUGHT)
          I heard a gunshot... then he ran
          out the front door and got in his
          car.
          The POLICE OFFICER looks at his partner and then proceeds to
          KICK DOWN the door.

          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- FOYER -- NEXT

           The OFFICERS move through the townhouse with their GUNS
           drawn. The SCREAMING of a YOUNG GIRL can be heard from
          upstairs.

          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

           The OFFICERS enter the kitchen. A WOMAN (20s) named AMY
           BEVILACQUA is slumped over on the kitchen floor in a pool of
          blood.
           The CAMERA moves in toward her face.

          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

           An OFFICER approaches the BATHROOM DOOR at the end of the
          hall. The screaming girl from inside is bawling her eyes out.
          The Officer sees a tiny HAND emerge from underneath the door.
          She is reaching out for help. He goes to open the door, but
          there is a LARGE DEAD BOLT LOCK mounted on the outside.

                         OFFICER #1
          Honey... I need you to back away
          from the door... I'M GONNA HAVE TO

          KICK IT DOWN?
          The screaming begins to subside.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)

          BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR!

                         FEMALE VOICE
          okay...
          The Officer then kicks the door down.

          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- NEXT

           Inside the bathroom... a YOUNG GIRL (7) is cowering in the
          bathtub... hyperventilating...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma and Arthur are sitting across from one another in
          silence. There is an empty BOTTLE OF WINE on the table.

                         ARTHUR
          There's no turning back now.
          Seconds later... THE DOORBELL RINGS.
          Both Norma and Arthur jump in their seats.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          Norma and Arthur move toward the front door. Norma puts her
          eye to the PEEPHOLE. Arlington's disfigured face stares back
          at her.
          She opens the door. Arlington stands there smiling...
          briefcase in hand.

                         ARLINGTON
          Hello, Mrs. Lewis.

                         NORMA
          Hi.

                         ARLINGTON
          Do you have the button unit?

                         NORMA
          Uhh... yeah... it's in the kitchen.
          Norma goes to the kitchen to retrieve the box, leaving Arthur
          alone with Arlington.

                         ARLINGTON
          And you must be Mr. Lewis.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          Arthur stares at him... transfixed. Does he recognize him
          from somewhere?
          Norma returns with the box and hands it over to him.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          And the key?

                         NORMA
          Oh... sorry...
          Norma reaches into her pocket and retrieves the small
          envelope and places it in his hand.

                         ARLINGTON
          Thank you.
          Arlington then opens the BRIEFCASE and shows it to them.
          Inside... the bills are stacked neatly in rows.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Two-hundred thousand. You can count
          it if you like.
          Arthur takes the briefcase from him and then closes.

                         ARTHUR
          Thanks... we trust your word.
          Arlington offers him a broad smile.

                         ARLINGTON
          As you should.
          He then turns to leave.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- NEXT

          They follow Arlington out onto the front walk as he
          approaches his car. The engine is idling... and someone else
          is behind the wheel... but through the tinted windows it is
          unclear who is driving.

                         NORMA
          You said before that the box is re-
          programmed...

                         ARLINGTON
          Yes.

                         NORMA
          So now what? Are you gonna go and
          make the offer to someone else?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         ARLINGTON
          Why yes. That-'s how it works, Mrs.
          Lewis.

                         (BEAT)
          And I can promise you that the
          offer will be made... to someone
          you do not know.
          He smiles... opens the door... and steps into the passenger
          side. The driver hits the gas and the car speeds off.
          Arthur moves out into the street... watching the car go...

                         ARTHUR
          I got his license plate.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur comes into the kitchen and goes to the desk and grabs
          a PENCIL. He then scrawls the LICENSE PLATE NUMBER down on a
          piece of scratch paper.

                         AXV-4049

                         ARTHUR
          What are you thinking, Norma?

                         NORMA
          I don't know.
          Arthur paces around... thinking. He then opens the briefcase
          and starts counting through the money.

                         ARTHUR
          Did he mean that we're next? Is
          that what he meant?

                         NORMA
          I don't know.

          INT. POLICE STATION -- BURNS'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          Jim Burns sits behind his desk at the POLICE STATION. His
          SECRETARY (20s) comes in to his office.

                         SECRETARY
          Your daughter is on line two.

                         JIM
          Alright.
          He picks up the phone.

                         JIM (CONT'D)
          Norma...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma stares at the money in the briefcase.

                         NORMA
          Hey dad...

                         JIM (PHONE)
          What's going on...

                         NORMA
          I need a favor.

                         JIM (PHONE)
          Sure... what do you need?

                         NORMA
          I need you to run a license plate
          for me. Someone just came by the
          house... and we think he might...
          (looking to Arthur)
          He just seemed real suspicious and
          Arthur got the license plate and I
          need you to run it.

                         JIM (PHONE)
          Okay honey... you need me to send
          someone over?

                         NORMA
          No... if you could just run the
          plate and find out whose car it is.

                         (BEAT)
          AXV-4049 is the number.

                          JIM (PHONE)
          I'll call you back in ten minutes.

          INT. POLICE STATION -- LATER

          An OFFICER removes a document from a PRINTER and approaches
          Burns's office.

                         OFFICER #2
          We ran those plates for you, sarge.
          Jim takes the document from him. It is a blow-up of a
          driver's license that belongs to ARLINGTON STEWARD. In the
          photo... his face is not injured.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma and Arthur are pacing around the kitchen... thinking.
          The PHONE rings... Norma answers it.

                         NORMA
          Hello?

                         JIM (PHONE)
          The car is listed to an Arlington
          J. Steward... do you want his
          address and phone number?

                         NORMA
          Yeah.
          Norma begins to write them down.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Norma is dialing a number with the phone in her lap.

          FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
          Hello?

                         NORMA
          Hi... I'm trying to reach an

          FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)

                         (LONG BEAT)
          Mrs. Lewis, I presume?
          Norma's eyes widen. She nods to Arthur and points to the
          phone. He rushes into the family room to pick up the other
          PHONE so he can listen in.

                         NORMA
          Yes.

          FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
          I assume that you pushed the
          button.

                         NORMA
          Yes.

          FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
          There is the myth of Prometheus and
          Pandora... Prometheus gave Pandora

          FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) (CONT'D)
          she unleashed a torrent of sorrow
          and misery.
          Norma stares at Arthur... unable to speak.

          FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) (CONT'D)
          Your descent into oblivion has
          begun. The question remains... what
          will the cuckold of a husband do...
          to prevent the death of his beloved
          Pandora?
          Arthur stares at Norma... unable to speak.

          FEMALE VOICE (PHONE) (CONT'D)
          Because really... Mr. Lewis... do
          you really know your wife?

                         ARTHUR
          Who is this?

          FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
          I am the mother of Prometheus...
          and if you want to save yourself...
          I suggest that you go to the
          Richmond Public Library, and find
          the book with the following call
          number: F2988.34
          Norma is writing the number out on a piece of paper.
          She disconnects. Arthur steps into the kitchen.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma...

                         NORMA
          Arthur...

                         ARTHUR
          Tell me this isn't real. Tell me
          this isn't happening.

                         NORMA
          This isn't real. This isn't
          happening.

                         ARTHUR
          I don't think I believe you, Norma.

          EXT. STEWARD RESIDENCE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur backs his car out of the driveway and into the street.
          Norma rides shotgun. Walter is circling around on his bike
          with some friends in tow.

          We're off to run an errand. Be back
          in a few hours, okay?

                         WALTER
          Okay.
          He watches as they drive off.

          Arthur and Norma drive toward downtown.

                         NORMA
          There was owl... in our back yard.

                         ARTHUR
          An owl?

                         NORMA
          He said it was his owl.

          No.

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NEXT

          The CAMERA tracks with Arthur and Norma as they move through

          They've quickly discover that
          they've all been sent to hell.
          Norma turns back to the inside cover of the book.
          Someone has written in crisp penmanship:

          Norma runs her hand down the list of names on the library

          Everyone is assembled... staring at a large BLANK SCREEN,
          waiting in anticipation. Cahill stands at the front of the

          The CAMERA cranes up toward the GIGANTIC LUNAR LANDER MODULE.
          Rain pours down from the night sky. Lightning flashes in the
          distance... several miles away. Thunder rumbles.
          The CAMERA approaches the UPPER TRESTLE BEAM... which crosses
          the expanse of the structure. Mounted on top of the beam is a

          MASSIVE ANTENNAE.
          Standing on the trestle several yards away from the antennae
          is ARLINGTON STEWARD. He is wearing a rain slicker and is
          face appears normal. He carries a walkie-talkie in his right

          Arlington looks at his watch... staring up at the sky...
          nervous about the storm. RAIN pours down upon on the
          module... water running down in sheets on either side of the
          trestle.
          He hears the cheering from the walkie-talkie. Thunder rumbles
          in the distance.

          Cahill emerges from inside the building and rushes out to the

          behind one of the planes... watching from a hidden vantage
          point...
          Cahill stands at a work table with Arlington. There are THREE
          BUTTON UNITS laid out on the table. Arlington begins to place

          door for his boss. Bus-Driver Bud is Steward's driver...
          Arlington steps inside.
          Wendell watches them drive off...

          Wendell then hands a file to Bevilacqua. Inside there is a
          dossier and photo of a ARTHUR LEWIS. He flips to another
          dossier and photo of another NASA EMPLOYEE named KENNETH

          WELLER.

                         WENDELL
          There's a list... and they've all
          got a wife and one child.
          Bevilacqua thumbs through the list of NASA dossiers. He sees
          Arthur Lewis among them.

                         WENDELL (CONT'D)
          Did you kill your wife?
          Bevilacqua just stares at him... on the verge of tears. He
          slides an ENVELOPE across the table.

                         BEVILACQUA
          This is a confession letter that I
          wrote... it explains everything
          that happened with Steward and the
          box. Keep it... cause if I don't
          make it... this might clear my name
          one day.
          Bevilacqua looks at the KENNETH WELLER dossier.

                         BEVILACQUA (CONT'D)
          This guy Weller is gonna be next.
          Did you get their phone number?

                         WENDELL
          No. They're not listed. Just an old
          address south of Petersburg. What
          are you gonna do?

                         BEVILACQUA
          I don't know. I need a car. I might
          be able to save them... and this
          guy Arthur Lewis...
          Wendell thinks to himself... then retrieves a set of KEYS
          from his pocket.

                         WENDELL
          These are the keys to my cousin's

          Standing there through the glass... is a man who looks
          identical to Arlington Steward.
          He stands with the normal side of his face in profile. He
          turns to face Jim... but his face now appears as it did
          before he was burned. Is this the same person?
          Jim turns to his receptionist... who waits in the doorway

          Jim stares at him from across his desk.

                         JIM
          Yes. Apparently he made an
          appearance at my daughter's house.
          Your brother works for NASA?

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NEXT

          Arlington nods his head.

                         ARLINGTON
          Yes. My brother works at the
          Langley research facility.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- BURNS'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          Jim nods his head in return.

                         JIM
          With my son-in-law.

                         RESTON
          That's right.

                         JIM
          And may I ask... what do you do,
          Mr. Steward?

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NEXT

          With his eyes closed... Arlington reaches into his pocket and
          retrieves something imaginary from his pocket. He raises
          something that we cannot see up into the air.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- BURNS'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          Reston is now holding out a GOVERNMENT BADGE with his right
          hand.

                         RESTON
          I work for the CIA.

                         JIM
          I see.
          He then hands Jim one of his cards. Jim looks at it.

          Reston rises to his feet... putting his hat on his head.

                         RESTON
          I assure you my brother is of no
          threat to your daughter. However,
          the man you're looking for...
          Robert Bevilacqua. He is very
          dangerous... and he might try and
          contact your son-in-law or your
          daughter.

                         JIM
          Really.

                          RESTON
          Yes.

                          RESTON (CONT'D)
          Help us find Bevilacqua. If and
          when you do... please call us.
          Jim stares at the business card as Reston bids him good-bye.

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NEXT

          Arlington is now standing. With his eyes still closed, he
          nods his head and smiles, then turns and begins to walk
          several steps. He then stops... takes a deep breath... and
          opens his eyes.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- RECEPTION AREA -- NEXT

          Reston opens his eyes... as if a spirit has suddenly left his
          body. He takes a deep breath and smiles at the Receptionist,
          trying to conceal his expression of horror.
          He moves toward the exit.

          EXT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

          Reston emerges from the General Assembly building. There is a
          black town car waiting. A CIA AGENT stands next to it.
          Reston withdraws a HANDKERCHIEF and wipes BLOOD from his
          nose.

          Norma and Arthur are still sitting in front of the microfiche
          machine. Norma looks like she is going to faint... her face
          has gone white.

                         ARTHUR
          You alright, Norma?

                         NORMA

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- CIRCULATION DESK -- NEXT

          Norma emerges from the records room and walks toward the
          circulation desk. As she rounds the corner... Arlington
          emerges from behind a row of book shelves.
          Norma stops in her tracks... frozen. He stares her down.

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur stares at the microfiche reader... transfixed by the
          newspaper articles.
          A shadow passes across the wall... and Arthur senses someone
          lurking over his shoulder. He turns to see that it is the
          LIBRARIAN. Something about her is different... she seems
          possessed.

                         LIBRARIAN

          Norma remains frozen... her mind racing. Arlington smiles at
          her... gesturing toward an empty chair.

                         ARLINGTON
          Have a seat... Mrs. Lewis.
          She looks around... realizing that the library is now
          completely empty.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Don't be afraid. I may look like a
          monster... but-I can assure you
          that I am... only human.
          His face contorts into a broad smile.

          My name is Clymene, mother of five.
          Prometheus, Atlas, Menoetius,

          A drop of blood begins to ooze from her left eye as she
          speaks.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Epimetheus is the twin brother of
          Prometheus, but he has become his

          Norma is now seated in a chair across from him. He stares
          deep into her eyes... transfixed by her beauty.

                         ARLINGTON
          Tell me Norma... when was the exact
          moment that you realized you loved
          your husband?
          There is something about him that now makes her feel safe...
          willing to tell him anything.

                         NORMA
          About five seconds after I laid
          eyes on him.

                         ARLINGTON
          And when was this?

                         NORMA
          In college. My sophomore year. He
          was a year younger than me. We
          dated for two weeks and then...
          She stops herself.

                         ARLINGTON
          You became frightened about
          something.

                         NORMA
          Then I thought... this is too good
          to be true. When he sees my mangled
          foot... he's gonna be out the door
          in ten seconds and he's gonna go
          tell all his friends.

                         ARLINGTON
          How did he respond when you showed
          him?

                         NORMA
          We were at the drive-in... and he
          caught a glimpse of the scars on my
          thigh. He asked me what happened...
          and I felt this sense of dread.

                         ARLINGTON
          Why?

          they discover something about you
          that they just can't stomach.

          Did the glow disappear from his
          eyes?

                         NORMA
          No. Not Arthur. He was different
          than the others. He... said that...
          my scars were cool.

                         (BEAT)

          Arthur sits across from Elizabeth. His mind is racing...
          trying to put the puzzle pieces together.
          He looks at his watch. It is almost 5PM.

                          ELIZABETH
           I have worked at this library for
          forty years. Since 1936, I have

          Of all of the books I have read in
          my lifetime... this is my son's
          favorite.

          Have you ever read No Exit?

                         ARTHUR

          He stares at the blood coagulating in the bag beneath her
          left eye.

                         ARTHUR
          I'm not gonna touch you, lady.

          INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- PERIODICALS SECTION -- NEXT

          Arlington now stares directly into Norma's soul.
          The scar tissue on the left side of his face does not move
          when he smiles. It remains frozen... unable to express
          emotion.

                         ARLINGTON
          And what emotion did you feel when
          you first laid eyes upon me, Norma?
          She thinks silently for a moment.

                         NORMA
          I felt.. .
          She stops herself... afraid of how he might respond if she is
          honest with him.

                         ARLINGTON
          You felt what?

                         NORMA
          I felt...

          Why?

                         NORMA
          Because of my foot. Because of my
          disfigurement. I thought of all the

          Arlington stands at the end of the corridor. He is wearing a
          TUXEDO, portraying the VALET character from Sartre's No Exit.
          The CAMERA pans around to reveal Arthur... walking slowly
          down the corridor.
          Arlington opens a DOOR at the end of the corridor and leads
          Arthur into a DRAWING ROOM... recreated from Sartre's play.

          Arlington leads Arthur inside and closes the door behind him.
          Inside the DRAWING ROOM, there are THREE COUCHES made in the
          style.: of the SECOND EMPIRE. The walls are covered in similar
          Renaissance art and the floor is marble.
          NORMA and WALTER have now been admitted to the drawing room.
          Norma is dressed in an elegant BLACK GOWN. Walter wears a
          tuxedo that looks to be nearly identical to the one his

          AROUND HIS HEAD. He wanders around the room... lost...
          The dimensions of the room are equal in every way. It is a
          perfect three-dimensional box.
          Arthur then looks to his wife. He notices that her EYELIDS
          are now gone. Arthur then turns to his son.
          Walter reaches out into the air... seemingly unaware that
          they are in, the room with him.
          The CAMERA moves through the wall into another corridor...
          BUD WALL... dressed as another VALET, passes by... and the

          at the top of the room...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

          INT. DREAM -- UPPER LEVEL -- NEXT

          The CAMERA pulls up higher... revealing the layout of a
          massive network of CORRIDORS and DRAWING ROOMS that form a
          larger box. Through the glass ceilings looking down into each
          room... FAMILIES are assembled together... trapped
          together... forever...

          EXT. MARS SURFACE -- NEXT

          The CAMERA flies over the edge of the SARTRE'S HOTEL of rooms
          and corridors to reveal the plateau of UTOPIA PLANITIA on the
          surface of mars...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- LATER ON

          Arthur's eyes pop open... he rolls over... and Norma is
          asleep in bed next to him. They are both fully dressed in the
          clothes they were wearing in the library.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma...
          Her eyes open. She looks around... disoriented.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Norma... what happened?

                         NORMA
          I don't know.
          Norma notices Walter standing in the doorway.

                         WALTER
          You came home an hour ago.

                         NORMA
          We did?
          She sits up in bed... looking at the clock radio. It is 6PM.

                         WALTER
          Neither of you said a word... you
          just walked into the house like two
          zombies. Went straight to bed.
          Arthur and Norma stare at one another, trying to make sense
          of what has just transpired.

                         NORMA
          The wedding. It starts in an hour.
          We've got to get ready.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Norma sees that the copy of No Exit is now sitting on --heir
          bedside table.

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. -- NIGHT

          A U.S. ARMY JET flies over the nation's capital. The PENTAGON
          and the WASHINGTON MONUMENT are visible below.

          INT. U.S. ARMY JET -- NEXT

           The CAMERA approaches US ARMY GENERAL NATHAN TEAGUE ( 50s),
          seated just behind the cockpit.
          In his lap is a file. He is thumbing through a series of
          photographs of the MARS SURFACE. He then arrives at a stack
          of paperwork. There is a photograph of ARTHUR LEWIS at the
          top of the stack.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BATHROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma, now wearing her BRIDESMAID DRESS, puts a DIAMOND
          EARRING in her right lobe. She turns to the mirror and jumps
          in her skin... as the face staring back at her has no
          eyelids.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- WALTER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur sits on the end of Walter's bed. Walters stands in
          front of him as his father ties his NECK TIE in front of a
          standing mirror.

                         WALTER
          What's going on?

                         ARTHUR
          I don't know.

                         WALTER
          This is about the box... isn't it?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         WALTER
          Did you push the button?

                         ARTHUR
          Your mother did.

                         WALTER
          What happens when you push the
          button?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         ARTHUR
          I don't know.

                         WALTER
          Yes you do. You're just not telling
          me.
          Arthur finishes with his tie. He notices something on the
          floor of his son's bedroom. It is the MARS COMIC BOOK.
          He picks it up and stares at the dark figure looming on the
          cover.

                         ARTHUR
          Where did you get this?

                         WALTER
          Dana. She gave it to me.
          Arthur begins to page through the comic book.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- ROOF TOP -- NEXT

          Arlington kneels at the edge of the MOTEL SWIMMING POOL. He
          runs his hand through the water. Steam is rising from the
          surface.
          STROBES OF WHITE LIGHT begin flicker from beneath the
          surface... as though some unseen SOURCE OF ENERGY is
          emanating from down below.
          Arlington slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington approaches the BLACK SEDAN idling in the car port.
          He gets inside... and Bud drives off.

          INT. SCOPE INSERT -- NIGHT

          The CAMERA looks through a TELESCOPE LENS of some sort from
          high on a ROOFTOP in downtown Richmond.
          It scans across several CARS passing down the street...
          PEDESTRIANS on the sidewalk... landing on ARLINGTON and BUD
          as they move toward the entrance of a STONE FRONT BUILDING.

          EXT. RICHMOND ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          We see that a SNIPER, dressed in a dark suit, is perched on
          the roof of an adjacent building. He has an earpiece in his
          left ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         SNIPER
          Alright... they are entering the
          building from the south entrance on
          fourteenth street.

          INT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington and Bud move down the main corridor of the GENERAL
          ASSEMBLY BUILDING, approaching a bank of ELEVATORS. A
          SECURITY GUARD nods to them nervously.
          Arlington nods back.

          INT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington and Bud emerge from the elevators on the THIRD
          FLOOR and move down the hall. As they pass into a RECEPTION
          AREA, the CAMERA moves toward a GLASS PARTITION with the
          VIRGINIA STATE EMBLEM etched into the glass.
          Below it is a name:

          HOUSE OF DELEGATES

          GRIFFITH POWELL - MAJORITY LEADER

           INT. GRIFFITH POWELL'S OFFICE -- RECEPTION -- NEXT

           As they approach the RECEPTION AREA... the FEMALE
          RECEPTIONIST ( 30s) stands up anxiously behind her desk.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Excuse me... may I help you?

                         ARLINGTON
          Where is he?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Uhhh... he's in a meeting.

                         ARLINGTON
          I need to see him... now.

          INT. GRIFFITH POWELL'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          The RECEPTIONIST comes into the office. Griffith Powell
          stands at the window behind his desk... smoking a cigarette.
          He is dressed in a TUXEDO with his jacket hanging next to his
          desk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          He's here... I don't know what to
          do.
          Powell turns to face her.

                         POWELL
          Let him in.
          The Receptionist goes back out... and within moments...
          Arlington and Bud enter the office. The Receptionist closes
          the door and leaves them alone.

                         ARLINGTON
          Hello Senator.

                         POWELL

                         (TERRIFIED)
          Mr. Steward... it's good to see
          you.

                         ARLINGTON
          Call me Arlington.

                         POWELL
          Okay... Arlington.
          Bud just stares at the Senator... showing no sign of emotion.

                         ARLINGTON
          Do you have my money?

                         POWELL
          I've given you four-hundred
          thousand already. How much more are
          you going to need?

                         ARLINGTON
          As much as it takes.
          Powell sighs out loud... irritated.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          First the nose...
          Powell turns around and there is now BLOOD GUSHING from his
          nose...

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Then the ears...
          BLOOD begins to ooze from both ears... as he covers his
          face... feeling the warm fluid rush from every orifice...

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Then the eyes...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          Blood rushes from beneath his eyelids... his entire face
          covered in BLOOD... his WHITE SHIRT DRENCHED...

                         POWELL
          Please! I've got it right here!
          Powell reaches beneath his desk and retrieves a large
          briefcase. He places it on the desk.

                         POWELL (CONT'D)
          It's all there! Two-hundred
          thousand! You can count it if you
          want!

                         ARLINGTON
          Bud...
          Bud grabs the briefcase from the desk and pops it open. He
          sees that it is filled with stacks of cash.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          You tell that sniper you have
          perched on that roof next door that
          I can smell his cheap cologne.

          EXT. RICHMOND ROOFTOP -- NEXT

           The SNIPER hears Arlington's VOICE in his earpiece.

                          ARLINGTON (EARPIECE)
          I think it might be Old Spice.
          The Sniper smells his shoulder.

          INT. POWELL'S OFFICE -- RECEPTION -- NEXT

          Arlington and Bud move through the reception area. The
          Receptionist lurks behind her desk... frightened.

          INT. FOREST LAWN BABTIST CHURCH -- NIGHT

          Arthur and Norma are standing in a WAITING ROOM in the church
          where her sister is about to be married. BRIDESMAIDS and
          GROOMSMEN are chatting with one another in anticipation of
          the ceremony.
          Norma clutches the copy of No Exit.

                         ARTHUR
          You and Walter were there in the
          room. You were wearing a black
          dress, identical to the one you
          have on now.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Walter had a blindfold on.

                         (BEAT)
          And then your eyes...

                         NORMA
          They didn't have lids...

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         NORMA
          I had the same dream.
          Arthur's mind is racing... he glances through the crowd
          nervously, afraid that they are being watched.

                         ARTHUR
          What's the last thing you remember?

                         NORMA
          The library. He was asking me all
          of these questions... about you...
          about our marriage.

                         (BEAT)
          Then I took his hand...
          Susan approaches...

                         SUSAN
          Alright girls... time to line up!
          Susan hands Arthur the book and goes off with the other

          BRIDESMAIDS.

          INT. FOREST LAWN BABTIST CHURCH -- NIGHT

          Norma stands next to Deborah as she is about to take her
          vows.

                         PREACHER
          Do you, Deborah Burns, take Edward
          Powell, to be your'-lawfully wedded
          husband, 'til death do you part?

                         DEBORAH
          I do.
          Norma looks over to Arthur, as he sits in the congregation.
          He is not paying attention to the wedding. He is reading
          Sartre's play...
          The CAMERA zooms into a close-up of the page describing the
          final scene in the play No Exit:

                         CURTAIN

          EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

          The WEDDING PARTY comes pouring out of the church. There is a
          massive LAWN south of the entrance. During the holidays it is
          filled with CHRISTMAS TREES for sale, and dozens of ARTS &
          CRAFTS BOOTHS assembled in rows.
          The CAMERA moves through the crowd to find Norma posing for
          photos with her fellow bridesmaids out in front of the
          square.
          ACROSS THE SQUARE... Bud Wall lurks within the rows of
          Christmas Trees. He spies Arthur and Walter mingling with his
          parents and Senator Powell, who has TWO SECRET SERVICEMEN
          standing close by.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- LATER ON

          The CAMERA approaches the driveway of the VIRGINIA HOUSE...
          which is positioned at the south end of Forest Lawn square.
          Wedding guests are arriving in droves.
          The house is a large GOTHIC MANSION that is often rented out
          for public events... and in this case... for the lavish
          WEDDING RECEPTION of Deborah Burns and Edward Powell.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK LAWN -- LATER ON

          Arthur and Norma move through the courtyard into the wedding
          reception area... which flows through several TENTS that have
          been erected with HEAT LAMPS and tables covered in WHITE
          TABLECLOTHS and FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS.
          Arthur carries the copy of No Exit with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         ARTHUR
          The play tells the story of uhree
          people, condemned to hell. They are
          to remain in a second empire
          drawing room for all of eternity.
          He closes the book... his mind dissecting what he has just
          read.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          They soon discover that their
          eyelids are missing... and for all
          eternity they will be unable to
          sleep.
          Norma remembers most of the play from high school.

                         NORMA
          There are no mirrors... so they
          will never be able to see their own
          reflection... but only the faces of
          their tormentors.

                         ARTHUR
          This is Sartre's vision of hell.

                         NORMA
          Because Hell... is other people.
          The look into one another's eyes... Norma sees a WAITER pass
          by with a tray of CHAMPAGNE. They both take a glass.
          Jim crosses the lawn to greet them.

                         JIM
          Arthur... can I speak with you
          privately for a moment?

                         ARTHUR
          Sure.
          Arthur walks away with Jim toward the edge of a PATIO that
          overlooks the whole party.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- UPPER PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER

          Jim and Arthur stand at a table. Jim has several PHOTOGRAPHS
          laid out on the table. They are mostly family photos taken
          from the house of Robert Bevilacqua.

                         JIM
          And do you know this fella? Robert
          Bevilacqua?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah... I know him. He works at

          NASA.

                         JIM
          Do you know his wife?

                         ARTHUR
          No...

                         JIM
          Well... he shot and killed his wife
          yesterday morning.

                         ARTHUR
          No...

                         JIM
          Yeah... He shot her point blank in
          the chest in his kitchen.
          Arthur takes a deep breath. He isn't feeling well.

                         JIM (CONT'D)
          This Bevilacqua fella... if he
          tries to contact you or Norma...
          you have to call me immediately,
          you understand?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah. Of course.
          Arthur looks down at the lawn. Norma is staring back at them.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK LAWN -- LATER ON

          Norma is now standing up on stage with a MICROPHONE in her
          hand..,. giving her MAID OF HONOR speech.

                         NORMA
          My little sister once asked me...
          what's the best thing about being
          married?
          Norma looks across the lawn to the table where Arthur is
          seated, next to Walter and their parents.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          I told her that... it's knowing
          that for the rest of your life
          you'll never feel alone.

                         (BEAT)
          Not ever again.
          She smiles at her husband.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          That is... until you get divorced.
          There is laughter from the crowd. Deborah blushes... leaning
          her head on her new husband's shoulder.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Or... until he decides to kill you.
          More laughter.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DANCE FLOOR -- LATER

          Arthur and Norma are now slow dancing.

                         ARTHUR
          Why did you say that?

                         NORMA
          Say what?

                         ARTHUR
          In your speech. That joke about me
          killing you.

                         NORMA
          I don't know... I thought it was
          funny. Guess I've had too much
          champagne.

                         ARTHUR
          Did your dad tell you about Robert
          Bevilacqua?

                         NORMA
          No.

                         ARTHUR
          He shot his wife yesterday morning.
          Did you know his wife?

                         NORMA
          No.
          Norma is still searching for some other explanation.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          What if it's all a test for the
          aspiring astronauts?

                         ARTHUR
          What do you mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         NORMA
          A psychological test. They want to
          see how you'll respond to a moral
          dilemma... the fate of a human
          life... determined by the push of a
          single button. Think of the men on
          the Apollo thirteen mission...
          sound familiar?
          They turn slowly on the dance floor...
          Arthur closes his eyes... his mind racing...
          A VOICE breaks through the music...

          VOICE (O.S.)
          May I cut in?
          Arthur and Norma turn to see a MAN standing there...
          It is DR. EARL STUPE.

                         STUPE
          I would like to dance with your
          wife. Do you mind?
          Arthur glares at Dr. Stupe.

                         NORMA
          It's okay Arthur...
          Arthur looks at him... then back at Norma. His face has gone
          pale and he looks for a moment as though he might faint on
          the dance floor.

                         ARTHUR

          I.. I.

                         (SWALLOWS HARD)
          Will you please excuse me?
          Arthur moves toward the stairs that lead up to the palatial
          estate. Walter is there... waiting.

                         WALTER
          Dad! What's going on?

                         ARTHUR
          I.. I'm gonna be sick Walter...
          He places his hand on his son's head for a brief moment and
          then stumbles up the stairs.
          ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Norma is now slow dancing with Dr.
          Stupe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         STUPE
          I know what they call me. Dr.
          Stupid. My patients... the ones who
          will still see me... they find out
          what I did and they stop calling.

                         NORMA
          I'm sorry for that. I can't control
          what people say.

                         STUPE
          I am Dr. Stupid now. Someone wrote
          it on my windshield with soap once.
          I figure it must have been a
          relative... a friend of yours.

                         (BEAT)
          Oh... how they love you, Norma
          Lewis. And they love your
          husband... the one who saved you.
          Did he save your life? Did he
          rescue you from the oblivion that I
          manufactured?

                         NORMA
          Yes. You have my forgiveness, Earl.
          People make mistakes... and if they
          seek forgiveness... they should be
          forgiven.

                         (BEAT)
          That's the rule of my lord.

          INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur comes into the MEN'S BATHROOM and rushes into one of
          the stalls. He falls to his knees... leaning over the toilet.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DANCE FLOOR -- LATER

          ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Norma notices her brother NATHAN...
          sitting alone at his table in his wheelchair. He is drunk...
          lost in his own sadness. He smiles at her...

                         STUPE
          There is that old cliche... that
          the lord works in mysterious ways.
          Well... I have met the lord. I have
          spoken to him in my dreams. And it
          brought me back to that day in my
          office when you arrived with a
          fractured foot... some thirteen
          years ago.

                         (BEAT)
          He told me that it was essential...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         STUPE (CONT'D)
          an essential event in the cycle of
          purgatory and its inevitable
          conclusion.
          Norma pulls away from him. Blood drains out of his nose...

                         STUPE (CONT'D)
          For when the cycle of purgatory
          concludes... there is nothing left
          but a barren wasteland of rock and
          sand... a deafening wind and a
          cold, dry winter.
          ABOVE... on the MARBLE RAILING... the OWL is perched on the
          ledge... watching...
          ON THE DANCE FLOOR... Stupe retrieves a PISTOL from his
          pocket... and raises his eyes to meet those of his dance
          partner.

                         STUPE (CONT'D)
          I am sorry my dear...
          Stupe takes the pistol... places it against his temple... and
          pulls the trigger.
          BLOOD SPRAYS across the dance floor... some of it on Norma's
          face. PEOPLE BEGIN TO SCREAM AND THE ENTIRE WEDDING ERUPTS

          INTO CHAOS...

          INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur is now standing at the urinal. He begins to hear
          commotion outside. He turns his head to the left... when
          something COLD and METAL locks itself around his wrist.
          Arthur turns back to the right and sees that it is Robert
          Bevilacqua. He is standing at the urinal next to him and they
          are now HAND-CUFFED TOGETHER at the wrists.
          Bevilacqua retrieves a GUN from his pocket at points it at
          Arthur. He has dark circles under his eyes.

                         BEVILACQUA
          You can still save yourself. It's
          too late for me... but you can
          still save yourself.

                         ARTHUR
          Bevilacqua...

                         BEVILACQUA
          Follow me out through the kitchen.
          I have a truck waiting...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK CORRIDOR -- NEXT

          Arthur and Bevilacqua emerge from the men's bathroom into a
          hallway that leads into the kitchen. Beyond them... in th.e
          PARLOR... there is commotion among the members of the wedding
          party in response to the gunshot.

          INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur and Bevilacqua move through the kitchen. The WAITERS
          and WAITRESSES are all distracted by the commotion and barely
          take notice of them as they pass through...

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Walter walks down the driveway as several POLICE OFFICERS
          rush past him, moving toward the entrance of the house. The
          whole place is being evacuated...
          He looks toward the square... and begins to move in that
          direction.
          The CAMERA drifts back toward the ROCK PILLAR that stands at
          the entrance to the house. Arlington is standing there in
          front of it. He is wearing his black hat... pulled down low.
          He begins to follow Walter toward the square...

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK DRIVEWAY -- NEXT

          Arthur and Bevilacqua come out the back entrance into the
          driveway. There is a WHITE PICKUP TRUCK parked there.
          Bevilacqua opens the passenger side door and the two of them
          slide across the seat, Bevilacqua behind the wheel.

          EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Walter wanders through a group of CHRISTMAS CAROLERS...
          moving toward the maze of CHRISTMAS TREES. He looks over his
          shoulder... where Arlington emerges from a crowd... staring
          him down like a monster.
          Walter's face is ghost white with terror. He begins to walk
          faster through the maze.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma comes down the driveway with her mother and sister...
          overcome with shock... searching the crowd...

                         NORMA
          Walter?

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK DRIVEWAY -- NEXT

          Bevilacqua puts the truck into drive and speeds out of the
          driveway onto the street.
          Jim stands across the lawn, manning the chaos. He recognizes
          the two men as the pass him by... and he raises his WALKIE-
          TALKIE to his mouth.

                         JIM
          I just spotted Bevilacqua... he's
          in a white pick-up truck. Potential
          hostage situation.

          EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Walter winds his way through the maze of Christmas trees...
          rounding a corner... where he runs into DANA.

                         DANA
          Walter...

                         WALTER
          Hey.
          Bud arrives next to her.

                         DANA
          Is everything alright?

                         WALTER
          No.

                         DANA
          Come with us.
          She takes his hand and they move north back toward the
          church.

          EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT

          The WHITE PICK-UP drives south down 1-95.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT

          Bevilacqua has his hands on the steering wheel... Arthur's
          left arm extended due to the hand-cuffing.

                         BEVILACQUA

                         (DELIRIOUS)
          Did you push the button... or was
          it your wife?

                         ARTHUR
          My wife.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Yeah... me too. I wasn't even home.
          She decided to push it when I
          wasn't around to stop her.

                         ARTHUR
          And now she's dead. Did you kill
          her?

                         BEVILACQUA
          I don't want to talk about it.

                         ARTHUR
          Where are you taking me?
          Bevilacqua retrieves a NASA DOSSIER from the dashboard and
          hands it to Arthur.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Kenneth Weller. You know him?

                         ARTHUR
          Name sounds familiar. Does he work
          at Langley too?

                         BEVILACQUA
          Yep. He's next. Him and his wife...
          they've got the box now.
          Suddenly... BLUE AND RED LIGHTS appear behind them...
          followed by the sound of a SIREN.

          EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT

          TWO POLICE CRUISERS are now tailing the pick-up truck.

          INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT

          Bevilacqua steps on the gas... accelerating to outrun them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         ARTHUR
          What are you doing?

                         BEVILACQUA
          I'm not gonna let them get me...
          Arthur... we've got to get to
          Kenneth Weller. We've got to break
          the chain... or your wife is gonna
          die!

                         ARTHUR
          How is she going to die?

                         BEVILACQUA
          You're going to kill her!
          Bevilacqua swerves into the ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE to pass a
          car in front of them. A LARGE 18-WHEELER TRUCK is barreling
          toward them.
          Bevilacqua pulls the truck back into the right lane.

          EXT. 1-95 -- NEXT

          The 18 WHEELER slams on the brakes... then jack-knives to
          the left... blocking both lanes...
          One of the POLICE CRUISERS pulls off into the ditch... while
          the second CRUISER swerves and SMASHES head on into the side
          of the truck bed... sheering the top of the sedan into two
          pieces...

          INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT

          Arthur looks back over his shoulder... seeing the cars smash
          together.

                         ARTHUR
          Jesus! You're gonna get us killed!

                         BEVILACQUA
          Did Steward take you to the
          library? Did you meet his mother...
          the librarian?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Did she tell you about Prometheus?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         BEVILACQUA
          Steward has a twin brother... and
          he works for the CIA.
          UP AHEAD... Arthur sees FOUR MORE POLICE CRUISERS with their
          lights flashing. They have formed a ROADBLOCK.
          Bevilacqua lowers his foot onto the accelerator... refusing
          to back down.

                         BEVILACQUA (CONT'D)
          This is purgatory... we're living
          in purgatory...

          EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT

          The WHITE TRUCK smashes through the line of POLICE CRUISERS
          as POLICE OFFICERS dive for cover.
          An officer raises his GUN and fires off several rounds toward
          the truck.
          A BULLET explodes the right front tire...
          The truck swerves and FLIPS OVER onto one side... tumbling
          over and over along the interstate in a horrific crash.
          ONCOMING CARS swerve into ditches... and the white truck
          comes sliding to a stop on the wet pavement.
          The CAMERA slowly approaches the smoking wreckage... catching
          a glimpse of Bevilacqua... his face covered in blood. Arthur
          remains hidden from sight.

          EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma rushes down the sidewalk on the perimeter of the
          square... searching for her son.

                         NORMA
          Walter?
          A BLACK SEDAN pulls up next to her... and Reston steps out of
          the car.
          Norma locks eyes with him... recognizing his face...

                         RESTON
          Mrs. Lewis? Norma Lewis?

                         NORMA
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         RESTON
          My name is Reston Steward. I work
          for the CIA.

                         NORMA
          Yeah? Where is my son? Where is my
          husband?

                         RESTON
          Please... get into the car.
          Norma stares at him in disbelief... as he opens the back door
          and gestures inside.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)

                         (GENTLE)
          Please... there isn't much time.

          EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT -- LATER ON

          Jim Burns walks through the aftermath of the crash site.
          There are now several FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCES and other
          EMERGENCY VEHICLES scattered on either side of the
          interstate.
          Robert Bevilacqua's DEAD BODY is now on a stretcher. Jim
          looks down at him briefly... then turns to another OFFICER on
          the scene.

                         JIM
          Where's Arthur?

                         OFFICER #1
          They took him away in an ambulance.

          INT. AMBULANCE -- NEXT

          Arthur sits up in the back of the ambulance. He has a small
          scrape on his cheekbone... but otherwise appears unharmed.
          An EMS TECHNICIAN is in there with him. He hands Arthur an

          ICE PACK.

                         EMS TECHNICIAN
          Here... hold this against your
          forehead. It'll keep your head from
          swelling.
          Arthur takes the ice pack and places it against his head.

                         ARTHUR
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         EMS TECHNICIAN
          I think it might have been a
          miracle.
          The EMS Technician shakes his head in disbelief.

                         ARTHUR
          What?

                         EMS TECHNICIAN
          That car accident. I've never seen
          someone walk away from an accident
          like that.

                         (BEAT)
          Somebody upstairs is looking out
          for you, buddy.
          The door to the ambulance opens. A US ARMY OFFICER appears.
          He steps away from the doors and General Teague emerges from
          the darkness.

                         TEAGUE
          Are you able to walk, son?

                         ARTHUR
          Yes, sir.

                         TEAGUE
          Please step out of the ambulance.

          EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT

          Arthur steps out of the ambulance and sees that it is parked
          in front of a HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL on an exit of 1-95. The
          hotel has a DINER attached to it.
          There are more than a dozen POLICE CARS parked in front,
          along with..several BLACK SEDANS and MILITARY VEHICLES.
          Arthur hears the rumble of a HELICOPTER circling the sky
          above them. Its SEARCHLIGHT sweeps through the forest.
          In front of the diner entrance... more than a DOZEN MEN
          operate VIDEO CAMERAS and STILL CAMERAS mounted on tripods,
          all pointed toward the front window of the diner.
          Teague is standing with Cahill and Reston, along with several
          other MILITARY PERSONNEL.
          Arthur notices Norma as she emerges from a BLACK SEDAN... she
          looks exhausted... delirious.

                         NORMA
          Arthur!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma!
          She hugs him... neither has slept in two days.

                         NORMA
          Where's Walter?

                         ARTHUR
          I don't know.
          Reston steps forward.

                         RESTON
          My brother has taken your son...
          but he assures me that he is alive
          and well.
          Reston tries to comfort them with a smile.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)
          Take a walk with us.
          Norma and Arthur begin to walk with Reston, Teague and Cahill
          toward the diner entrance.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)
          Are you familiar with the myth of
          Prometheus?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         RESTON
          In the 1940s... when NASA was
          formed, we began developing, in
          secret, a project that we dubbed
          the Prometheus Effect.

                         TEAGUE
          Projecting fictional scenarios
          about how we would respond, if and
          when we came into contact with an
          alien intelligence.

                         RESTON
          If the intelligence had hostile
          intent... or if it began to somehow
          display proof of its ability to
          destroy us, we would have a system
          in place to begin negotiating with
          it in secret.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         TEAGUE
          The goal of Prometheus is to
          maintain coexistence with this life-
          form, and eventually achieve peace
          with it, so that its power can be
          harnessed, developed and applied in
          such a manner that will benefit the
          human race.
          Arthur notices that Cahill is holding a folder in his right
          hand.

                         CAHILL
          On the night of September 3rd, as
          the server was downloading images
          from the Viking camera system that
          you helped design... we experienced
          an electrical surge from a bolt of
          lightning.
          As they arrive at the entrance to the diner, Cahill shows
          Arthur a blurry black and white photograph.

                         CAHILL (CONT'D)
          An anomaly in the series of Viking
          images produced this photograph of
          the Mars surface.
          The photo appears to be a ghost-like TRAIL OF WHITE LIGHT
          streaking across the martian landscape.
          Teague nods toward the diner window.

                         TEAGUE
          According to... it... and whatever
          it is...
          Arthur notices Arlington sitting alone in a booth inside the
          diner... waiting...

                         TEAGUE (CONT'D)
          A ghost... an apparition... a
          methane compound imbedded in pulse
          of electricity...

                         CAHILL
          If the human spirit is assigned a
          specific bandwidth upon
          conception... twins... would
          provide it with a dual bandwidth
          carrier...

                         RESTON

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          It claims to be more than six
          billion years old.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         J
          Arthur stares at the streak of white light in the photo.

                         ARTHUR
          My camera... took this photo...

                         CAHILL
          We've run the data sequence off the
          server more than a thousand times.
          Each time... this one photo in the
          sequence comes out of the dark room
          just like this. We can't explain
          why.
          Arthur hands the photo back to Cahill.

                         NORMA
          What does it want?
          Cahill glances at Teague... who looks to Cahill.

                         CAHILL
          I think the same thing that it
          wanted from Bevilacqua... except
          that poor boy is no longer around
          to tell us why he shot his wife.

                         NORMA
          What did he say to you when you
          were in the car with him?

                         ARTHUR
          Something about breaking the chain.
          He wanted to find the next test
          subject... and prevent them from
          pushing the button.
          Cahill is writing diligently on his NOTE PAD.
          Reston can now feel something taking control of him... he
          looks to Teague... terrified.
          He closes his eyes... his body begins to twitch.
          Teague stares at his friend... realizing what is happening.
          Reston opens his eyes... now possessed... blood draining from
          his ears.

                         RESTON
          General Teague... it's a pleasure
          to meet you.

                         (BEAT)
          I would like to continue with my
          experiment... if you don't mind.
          Reston smiles at the General.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)
          Please do not interfere... as I
          assure you that if you do... there
          will be dire consequences...
          Reston then turns to face Arthur and Norma.

                         RESTON (CONT'D)
          Time is of the essence... and I'd
          like to invite my guests inside.
          Reston opens the door to the diner and gestures to Arthur and
          Norma for them to come inside.

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Arthur, Norma and Reston make their way down the long aisle
          of the diner, flanked by a row of booths, across from a long
          LUNCH COUNTER with a metal surface.
          Arlington sits alone in a booth. He pivots his head around to
          face them.

                         ARLINGTON
          Please have a seat.
          Reston sits down next to his twin brother... Arthur and Norma
          sit down across from the twins.
          Arlington has now locked completely into his brother's
          spirit...
          The movement of the two men is in now in PERFECT
          SYNCHRONICITY, staggered by exactly one second... Reston
          following Arlington.
          Arlington's eyes remain closed in deep concentration...
          Arlington's lips move silently... and Reston repeats them out
          loud. Reston's demeanor is now kind... gentle... almost
          apologetic for his past behavior.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          Don't be frightened by my manner of
          communication... but it is becoming
          more difficult for me to speak,
          given my body's... condition.

                         NORMA
          What have you done with our son?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          We'll get to him in a moment... but
          first I want you to know that I
          have a deep respect and admiration
          you both, and I am very sorry...
          that you pushed the button.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT

          Bud now has Walter laid out on the cement next the edge of
          the SWIMMING POOL at the shallow end. The boy is
          unconscious... still dressed in his suit from the wedding.
          From across the pool... Dana is squatting on the end of the
          DIVING BOARD... watching them.
          Bud then removes Walter's right shoe and sock... exposing his
          bare foot. He then retrieves a SERRATED HUNTING KNIFE... and
          cuts in the flesh from his BIG TOE across the ball of his
          foot... drawing blood.

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Reston closes his eyes for a moment. When he opens them...
          tears have begun to form, as though he cannot bear the news
          that his brother is forcing him to deliver.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          I will now give you a chance to
          save yourselves... an opportunity
          for redemption and salvation.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT

          Bud is now carrying the unconscious Walter in his arms. He
          steps into the shallow end of the heated pool... and dunks
          the boy under the surface.
          BLOOD from the cut on the bottom of his foot drains out into
          the water like red ink...

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Norma closes her eyes... the impending sense of dread
          building inside of her.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          Two of your son's five functional
          senses have been permanently
          impaired.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT

          UNDERWATER... Walter floats with his arms spread wide...
          WHITE STROBES OF LIGHT FLICKER AROUND HIM. The light streaks
          bear a close resemblance to the image in the -Mars photo.
          Blood streams out from his foot into the water.

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Blood is now flowing out of Reston's left nostril. Both
          Arthur and Norma recoil in horror.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          He is now blind and deaf.

                         (BEAT)
          For the rest of his life, he will
          never hear your voice... or see
          your face.

                         ARTHUR
          (under his breath)
          Why...

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          You are now presented with two
          options.

                         (BEAT)
          Option one... you enjoy the rest of
          your lives with the money you have
          been given, and you learn to live
          with your son's disability.
          Reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a PISTOL.
          He places it on the table next to the box.

          RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          And then there is option number
          two.

                         (BEAT)
          There is one bullet in the chamber
          of this gun.
          Reston slides the gun across the table in Arthur's direction.

          RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          You can fire this bullet into your
          wife's heart... killing her.

                         (BEAT)
          At the exact moment that her spirit
          departs the earth, this curse upon
          your son will be reversed, and both
          of his impaired senses will
          instantaneously return to normal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          Arthur looks over at Norma in disbelief... then back at the
          twins. He cannot fathom how it has now come to this.

          RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Arthur, you will then be arrested
          and charged with the murder of your
          wife... and the money will be
          placed in an interest bearing trust
          for your son to receive upon his
          eighteenth birthday.

                         NORMA
          That's not fair.

                         (BEAT)
          Let me do it. I, pushed your stupid
          button. If I deserve to be punished
          for it... then let me kill myself.
          Arthur has nothing to do with this.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          I'm sorry, but the offer is not
          negotiable.

                         (TO ARTHUR)
          And if Norma's fingers so much as
          touch the weapon at any point from
          this moment on... the restoration
          of Walter's sight and sound will be
          denied.

                         NORMA
          If Arthur has to do it... then I
          want you to make it look like a
          suicide. Arthur shouldn't be
          punished for something that I did.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          I'm sorry... but the terms of the
          offer are not negotiable.
          Arthur faces has gone completely white.

                         ARTHUR
          Is there an afterlife?
          The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Because this is purgatory, right?
          The earth is purgatory... and
          you're here to start shutting
          things down... right?
          The twins appear impressed with his foresight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          I find your theory to be quite
          fascinating. But I must remind you
          that I am unable to disclose the
          identity of my employers.
          Arthur glances out the window at all of the cameras.

                         ARTHUR
          Right. I get it.
          Reston then turns to the window...

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          Can someone please bring up the
          car?

          EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur and Norma emerge from the diner in a state of
          delirium. A SOLDIER pulls up in Arthur's TRANS-AM. He steps
          out of the car and holds the door open.
          Teague and Cahill approach... as MEN in dark suits snap
          hundreds of photographs of the couple.
          Cahill puts his hand on Arthur's shoulder... searching for
          words.
          Teague glances inside the diner... then back at Arthur.
          Arthur nods his head slowly... his mind lost... and he limps
          toward the car with Norma at his side.

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT

          Norma sits behind the wheel... allowing Arthur to ride
          shotgun. He looks weakened by the whole ordeal, and she is
          afraid he might pass out.

                         ARTHUR
          Tell me this isn't happening,
          Norma.

                         NORMA
          This isn't happening...
          She starts the engine... and they drive off.
          Arthur watches the parking lot full of MEN reflected back at
          them in the side-view mirror.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          EXT. INTERSTATE 95 -- SUNRISE

           HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA flies over 1-95 as Arthur's car
          travels north toward Richmond. A MILITARY HELICOPTER flies
          overhead... escorting them on their journey home.

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT

          Arthur sits shotgun as Norma drives them home. They have been
          riding in silence for quite some time now, having reached a
          level of complete mental and physical exhaustion.

                         NORMA
          All these years... I've given you
          the impression that Walter was an
          accident.

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah... and?

                         NORMA
          And... it wasn't exactly an
          accident.

                         (BEAT)
          I stopped taking the pill when I
          met you...

                         ARTHUR
          Why?

                         NORMA
          Because I was so afraid of losing
          you to someone prettier than me.
          Arthur just stares at her... unsure how to respond.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          For that alone... I deserve a
          bullet in the heart... don't you
          think?

                         ARTHUR
          No... I don't.
          She manages a smile. A tear rolls down her cheek as she
          stares out at the pavement and the endless trees lining
          either side of the interstate.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- EARLY MORNING

          Arthur pulls the car up into the driveway. The street is
          quiet and empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          They step out of the car. Dana is sitting on the front porch,
          waiting for them.
          She rises to her feet as they approach.

                         DANA
          Did my dad tell you why he loves
          you, Norma?
          Norma realizes that she has been involved all along. Blood
          drains from her nose.

                         NORMA
          No.

                         DANA
          Because you're an amputee. He says
          that the soul of an amputee leaks
          out into the wind... searching for
          the place where there is no longer
          flesh and bone.

                         (BEAT)
          It says that the soul that leaks is
          the soul that endures. It is the
          kindest and bravest soul of them
          all.

                         NORMA
          Where is our son?

                         DANA
          He's locked in the upstairs
          bathroom. I think he just woke up.
          Dana turns away... and begins to walk down the sidewalk in
          the opposite direction.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- NEXT

          Walter lays inside the bathtub, soaking wet. He is still
          wearing his suit from the wedding. He is shivering... looking
          around... disoriented...
          His EYE-BALLS are now COMPLETELY WHITE... pupils no longer
          visible.

                         WALTER
          Is anyone-there?!
          He begins clawing at the walls... trying to figure out where
          he is.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          I can't see!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          He climbs out of the bathtub and begins to crawl across the
          tile floor. He runs into the door... and then reaches up and
          finds the DOORKNOB. It is locked.
          He begins to bang on the door relentlessly.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

          Norma and Arthur come up the stairs and round the corner of
          the hallway. Walter's HAND reaches out through the crack
          beneath the door.
          Norma tries to open the door but there is a MASSIVE LOCK
          installed on it.

                         NORMA
          Walter!
          Norma reaches down and takes her son's hand.

                         WALTER
          Who's there?! Who's there?!

                         NORMA
          Walter! It's mom! Can you hear me?!

                         WALTER

          WHO'S THERE?!!

                         NORMA

          CAN YOU HEAR ME!!?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- NEXT

          He does not respond... and begins banging his head against
          the door... harder and harder...
          Thump... thump...

          NORMA (O.S.)

          CAN YOU HEAR ME?!!!

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

          No response... just his head... slamming against the door
          repeatedly.

                         ARTHUR
          We need to kick the door down.

                         NORMA
          He could get hurt...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          Norma begins to pound back on the door with her fist... and
          eventually the thumping stops. She begins to hear quiet sobs
          from inside the bathroom.

                         WALTER
          Who's there? Who's there?
          Norma rises to her feet.

                         NORMA
          Come downstairs, Arthur.
          She takes his left hand... as he clutches Walter's hand in
          his right.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          Arthur...

                         (BEAT)
          I need you to come downstairs with
          me... right now.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

          SUZANNE WELLER (30s) sits on her bed. Her husband KENNETH
          WELLER (30s) stands at the window. Neither looks like they
          have slept in a while.
          Suzanne has the box sitting on the mattress in front of
          her... the glass dome is open.

                         SUZANNE
          I'm gonna push it.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur and Norma stand across from one another in the
          kitchen. Arthur holds the GUN in his right hand... and he
          slowly limps over to his wife and takes her into his arms.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma...

                         NORMA
          Arthur... I love you, and I'm so
          sorry... I'm so sorry that I did
          this to us...

                         ARTHUR
          I'm the one who told you to push
          the button... so don't apologize.
          He looks out through the window at his back yard... likely
          for the last time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          I love you too... and please
          know... that I regret nothing in
          this life we've lived together.

                         NORMA
          I'll be waiting... counting the
          days until my Arthur comes to see
          me.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Suzanne Weller smiles at her husband... reaches her finger
          out and places it on the button.
          She then presses down.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          FROM UPSTAIRS... thump... thump... their son's head banging
          against the door...

                         NORMA
          It's going to be harder for you to
          live than for me to die.
          Arthur closes his eyes... the noise is excruciating. There is
          no time to wait any longer.

                         ARTHUR
          Well then.

                         (BEAT)
          Let's get on with it.
          Arthur kisses her... then steps back... still clutching her
          hand... raises the gun... and fires off a round into her
          heart.
          Norma collapses... Arthur falls with her... breaking her fall
          with his arms as they collapse into a heap onto the linoleum
          floor.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Suzanne looks over at her husband and lets out a deranged
          giggle. He smiles back.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur looks down into his wife's eyes as the life drains
          from her body. Seconds later... Norma is dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          BLOOD begins to flow from the exit wound in her back across
          the linoleum. Arthur is now covered in it.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Walter crawls across the blood-soaked kitchen floor and
          reaches up to the PHONE that is mounted on the wall. He takes
          his finger and places it in the cradle... dials 911.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- 911 EMERGENCY -- NEXT

          The CAMERA tracks along a series of CUBICLES at the POLICE
          STATION in downtown Richmond. An OPERATOR sits at each
          cubicle... each one female.

                         OPERATOR #1
          911 emergency... how may I direct
          your call?
          The CAMERA moves in closer...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur has the phone to his ear... imprints of his wife's
          blood are smeared on the phone's receiver.

                         ARTHUR
          Yes. This is Arthur Lewis at 1560
          Monument Avenue. I've just shot my
          wife... can you please send an
          ambulance?
          The Operator begins to ask more questions... but Arthur does
          not listen. He hangs up the phone.
          The thumping from upstairs has now subsided.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)

          WALTER!!!
          He pulls himself to his feet and heads into the foyer.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur rounds the corner at the base of the stairs...

                         ARTHUR

          WALTER!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

          Arthur rounds the corner of the upstairs hallway... rushes
          toward the bathroom door.
          Walter's hand comes sliding out from beneath the crack in the
          door. Arthur grabs it.

                         ARTHUR

          WALTER!!!

                         WALTER
          Dad?

                         ARTHUR
          Yes... can you hear me?

                         WALTER
          Yeah.

                         ARTHUR
          What do you see? Where are you
          Walter?

                         WALTER
          I'm in the bathroom...

                         ARTHUR
          Can you see clearly?

                         WALTER
          Yeah... I can see... everything is
          bright... but I can see.

                         ARTHUR
          Everything is bright. Everything is
          bright Walter... you're gonna be
          okay, buddy.

                         WALTER
          What's going on?

                         ARTHUR
          You're gonna be okay, buddy. That's
          all that matters.

                         (BEAT)
          That's all that matters, now.
          Out of the corner of his eye, Arthur notices something at the
          top of the stairs. It is a POLICE OFFICER. He has his gun
          aimed at Arthur.

                         POLICE OFFICER

          BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND PUT

          YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Arthur stares at the officer... frozen... the repercussions
          of his decision now stare him in the face with a loaded gun.

          POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)

          I SAID BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND

          PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!!
          Arthur obeys... and the cop rushes over and pushes him over
          onto his stomach... handcuffing his wrists together.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          The DOORBELL rings.
          Suzanne Weller opens the door. Arlington is standing there
          with his briefcase... smiling.

                         ARLINGTON
          Mrs. Weller... do you have the
          button unit?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- LATER THAT MORNING

          A CORONER places a BLANKET over Norma's face as the house is
          sealed off by various CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS and other
          police.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur is now being escorted by two POLICE OFFICERS to a
          waiting CRUISER that is parked in front of the house.
          Jim Burns is standing there with the door open.

                         ARTHUR
          I'm sorry, Jim.
          He stares Arthur down as he is put into the back seat of the
          cruiser. Jim closes the door and goes around to the front of
          the car.
          Jim gets behind the wheel and starts the engine.
          Arthur looks back through the window, toward his house.
          Upstairs in the MASTER BEDROOM WINDOW... Walter is watching,
          tears streaming down his face.
          Arthur reaches up with his hands... cuffed together... and
          tries his best to wave at his son.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)

                         (MOUTHING SILENTLY)
          I`m sorry...
          From the window... Walter watches the car pull away from the
          curb.
          He places his hand on the glass... waving back.

Brazil - the screenplay


 


                            Brazil
                      Screenplay (Draft)




 

1   EXT.   CITYSCAPE                         SUNSET           1

    A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The
    CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises
    into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the
    frame. The building is neither past nor future in design
    but a bit of both.
    
    Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads
    below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated
    transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely
    huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule
    relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level
    awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent
    tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an
    elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of
    large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,
    the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs
    take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper
    levels of a plush shopping precinct.

2   INT.   SHOPPING PRECINT                  NIGHT            2
    
    Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,
    ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on
    display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly
    packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of
    elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one
    window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the
    screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister
    of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to
    listen to HELPMANN.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Deputy minister, what do you believe
               is behind this recent increase in
               terrorist bombings?

                           HELPMANN
               Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless
               minority of people seems to have
               forgotten certain good old fashioned
               virtues. They just can't stand seeing
               the other fellow win. If these people
               would just play the game, instead of
               standing on the touch line heckling -

                          INTERVIEWER
               In fact, killing people -

                           HELPMANN
               - In fact, killing people - they'd
               get a lot more out of life.

    We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers.
    HELPMANN's voice carries over the rest of the scene.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to
               those critics who maintain that the
               Ministry Of Information has become
               too large and unwieldy ...?

                           HELPMANN
               David ... in a free society
               information is the name of the game.
               You can't win the game if you're a
               man short.

    Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be
    banks of snow but as we pan along with them the "snow"
    turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop
    front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames.
    WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood
    sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are
    being played by a Salvation Army style band calling
    themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is
    busy, all is well with the world.

                          INTERVIEWER
               And the cost of it all, Deputy
               Minister? Seven percent of the gross
               national produce ...

                           HELPMANN
               I understand this concern on behalf
               of the tax-payers. People want value
               for money and a cost-effective
               service.

3   INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT            3

    CUT TO TV screen with HELPMANN still talking.

                           HELPMANN
               That is why we always insist on the
               principle of Information Retrieval
               Charges. These terrorists are not
               pulling their weight, and it's
               absolutely right and fair that those
               found guilty should pay for their
               periods of detention and the
               Information Retrieval Procedures used
               in their interrogation.

    PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests
    on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-
    tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He
    comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to
    discover a shiny, metal "executive toy".

    CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.

    The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as
    it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some
    paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.

Scenes 4-12 Deleted.                              4-12 Deleted.

13  INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT           13
    
    The TECHNICIAN gets up and balances a chair on top of his
    desk. He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE
    still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath
    him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away
    compiling a typed list of names under the heading
    "Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention &
    Interview". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper
    which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic
    guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate
    sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet
    following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE-
    UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in
    the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F.
    ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ... TURNER,
    John D. ... Every name begins with T.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Do you think that the government is
               winning the battle against
               terrorists?

                           HELPMANN
               On yes. Our morale is much higher
               than theirs, we're fielding all their
               strokes, running a lot of them out,
               and pretty consistently knocking them
               for six. I'd say they're nearly out
               of the game.
               
    The TECHNICIAN is tottering on one leg on the chair on the
    desk as he strains to swat the BEETLE. Swish, swash, oops,
    WHAP! Gottcha!!

                          INTERVIEWER
               But the bombing campaign is now in
               its thirteenth year ...

                           HELPMANN
               Beginner's luck.

    The BEETLE's career comes to a halt ... squashed flat on
    the brilliantly clean ceiling ... or has it? As the
    TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the
    BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops
    silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs,
    hesitates and then types the letter "B" and hesitates and
    then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.

    The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine
    continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ... TUZCZLOW,
    Peter...

                          INTERVIEWER
               Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

                           HELPMANN
               Thank you, David ... and a very merry
               Christmas to you all.

14  EXT.   HOUSING TOWERS                    NIGHT           14
    
    ZOOMING past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we
    TIGHTEN in on one of several massive residential tower
    blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of
    the city

15  INT.   BUTTLE FLAT                       NIGHT           15
    
    HELPMANN and INTERVIEWER are on the TV, the end credits
    rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune.
    PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional
    sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out
    the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that
    snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. Smaller
    conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various
    services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the
    metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but
    proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading
    Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six.
    BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some
    action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting
    the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present
    which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just
    seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.

    Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of
    the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the
    floor above.

16  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           16

    The flat is very bare and basic. The laughter is coming
    from a cheap portable television showing "Sgt. Bilko. From
    BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom
    straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the
    person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath
    is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she
    watches Bilko in the mirror. From her POV in the mirror,
    the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body
    of a MAN in uniform.

                             JILL
                    (scared)
               Who's there?

17  INT.   BUTTLE'S FLAT                     NIGHT           17
    
    The BUTTLE FAMILY as before. MRS BUTTLE is closing the
    book.

                          MRS BUTTLE
               There, that's enough for tonight. He
               won't come Xmas Eve if you don't get
               plenty of sleep.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Father Christmas can't come if we
               haven't got a chimney.

                          MRS BUTTLE
               You'll see.

    The GIRL exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and
    leaves the room.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
               How will he get down from upstairs?

                          BOY BUTTLE
               It's a secret.

    We follow GIRL BUTTLE out of the sitting room into ...

18  INT.   HALLWAY AND CHILDREN'S BEDROOM    NIGHT           18

    GIRL BUTTLE enters her bedroom. There is little or no
    light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently
    lowering himself into the room from the direction of the
    ceiling.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
                    (unalarmed)
               You've come ...

    As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the
    figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid,
    slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. The
    pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the
    ceiling. Things become immediately clearer

19  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM               NIGHT           19

    Crash! It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash
    trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in
    the window from the outside and enters that way. Most
    alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the
    ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and
    through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide
    TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal
    and violent.
    
    BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike
    canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal
    clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back
    of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In
    seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL
    BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into
    the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy
    machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we
    see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has
    been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are
    viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the
    doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An
    OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front
    door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an
    official document. It goes something like this:

                           OFFICIAL
               I hereby inform you under powers
               entrusted to me under Section 47,
               Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number
               438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald,
               residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri
               La Towers, has been invited to assist
               the Ministry of Information with
               certain enquiries, the nature of
               which may be ascertained on
               completion of application form
               BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this
               date, and that he is liable to

               Council Order 173497, including
               financial restitutions which may or
               may not be incurred if Information
               Retrieval procedures beyond those
               incorporated in Article 7 subsections
               8, 10 & 32 are required to elicit
               information leading to permanent
               arrest - notification of which will
               he served with the time period of 5
               working days as stipulated by law. In
               that instance the detainee will be
               debited without further notice
               through central banking procedures
               without prejudice until and unless at

               or third parties on completion of a
               re-imbursement form RB/CZ/907/X ...

    ... and more of the same, most of which is part of the
    audible wall paper while the chaos reigns. As the front
    door slams behind the captive relative peace returns,
    broken by MRS BUTTLE's anguished sobbing.

                    (taking blue book from her)
               Thank you. And this is my receipt for
               your receipt.
                    (he turns to leave along
                    with troopers)

    JILL's shocked face appears looking down through the hole
    in the ceiling. The faces of the workmen BILL and CHARLIE
    also appear, above and behind her.

                             JILL
               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?

    The helmeted SECURITY TROOPS in Buttle's flat drop to
    defensive positions and swing their machine guns up
    towards the hole in the ceiling. All three faces retreat.
    
    
20  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           20
    
                            CHARLIE
                    (starting back from the
                    hole with Bill and Jill)
               Eh! Eh! Eh! We're Department of
               Works! Department of Works up here!
               Careful with those bloody things!
    
    JILL, CHARLIE and BILL are hustled aside by a SECURITY MAN
    who clears the fireman's pole from the hole. We can see
    the TROOPS in the room below leaving. A SECOND SECURITY
    man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window. He
    coils the rope up neatly and the TWO SECURITY MEN leave
    the flat.
    
                             BILL
                    (to Jill as they watch this
                    highly efficient operation)
               Don't take any notice, love, it's
               their training makes them like
               animals. Best in the world, though.
    
                             JILL
               Who are you?
    
                            CHARLIE
               Don't you worry love, we'll have
               everything shipshape in a jiffy.
    
                             BILL
               That's it. Nothing to worry about.
    
                            CHARLIE
               It's Buttle downstairs who can worry,
               eh?
    
                             JILL
               There must be some mistake ... Mr
               Buttle's harmless...
    
                             BILL
               We don't make mistakes.
    
    So saying, he drops the manhole cover, which is faced with
    same material as the floor, over the hole in the floor. To
    his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the
    flat below.
                            CHARLIE
               Bloody typical, they've gone back to
               metric without telling us
               

20a INT.   BUTTLES' FLAT                     NIGHT          20a
    
    MRS BUTTLE stands stunned in the middle of her decimated
    flat. The KIDS wail. Slowly MRS BUTTLE collapses -
    slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we
    tighten into CLOSE UP of "Receipt".

                       JILL (off CAMERA)
               Mrs Buttle? Mrs Buttle?

21  INT.   RECORD CLERK'S POOL                               21
    
    We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT
    being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to
    reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal
    desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each
    (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed
    under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in
    the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk
    intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS
    bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of
    the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,
    tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is
    supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN.
    Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and
    walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top
    of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.

    MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it
    behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each
    CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch,
    and all the screens change to something which looks very
    like "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly".

22  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             22
    
    MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his
    desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the
    console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number
    of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE
    say, "Turn around real slow, amigo". MR KURTZMAN turns
    around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his
    T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently
    flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which
    we see as marked "Buttle, Archibald". He opens the file
    and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V.
    starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled.
    He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash
    "Error, error, error". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration.
    He presses an intercom.
                          MR KURTZMAN
                    (into intercom)
               Mr Lowry, will you step in here
               please?
               
    He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody
    comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over
    to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of
    CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and
    whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in
    the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.

                          MR KURTZMAN
               Does anyone know where Lowry is?

    Nobody knows. MR KURTZMAN closes his door again. A moment
    later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the
    crash of six guns blazing away at each other. He re-opens
    the door. The only sound again. He goes back to his desk.
    He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even
    more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "Admit
    you're whupped, you drygulching scum". KURTZMAN explodes
    with anger, and presses the intercom again.

                          MR KURTZMAN
                    (Shouting into intercom)
               Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!

23  EXT.   SKY                               DAY             23
    
    CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird-
    like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer
    we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood
    and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their
    flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect.
    Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an
    outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI
    fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then,
    banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice
    can be heard calling "Sam ... Sam ... Sam". He hovers,
    looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO
    face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised
    twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her
    face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly
    mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft
    billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises
    and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA
    GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that
    the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast
    landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the
    sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial
    ballet.
    
    Romantic music fills the soundtrack.
    
    SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as
    SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM
    begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy
    quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening
    rumble. SAM looks down.
    
    The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive,
    monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and
    soars upwards with a mighty rush.
    
    CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into
    FRAME partially cutting her off from view.
    
    Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper
    breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another
    and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is
    being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless
    structures. And then she is finally lost from view
    somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis.
    SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid.
    No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with
    their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among
    these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only
    sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls
    plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound
    but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in
    this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something
    in the distance. far below him a dark procession is
    wending its way through the narrow passages... away from
    him.
    
    CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way
    past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister
    figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several
    heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal
    cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the
    cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside
    is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as
    if there were a breeze in constant attendance.
    
    CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.
    
    CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their
    tracks. They've seen something.
    
    CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between
    two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.
    
    CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back.
    Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces
    are the same except for the manner in which they have
    decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly
    the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become
    long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others
    shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The
    FORCES are massed ready to charge.
    CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his
    wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.
    
    Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the
    constant dribble from their cracked mouths.

    CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable.
    Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the
    fearsome horde. Unarmed!

    CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing
    madly.

    SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading
    field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time
    catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries
    a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack!
    Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this
    boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing
    of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way
    through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly,
    they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate
    SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way
    toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise
    behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of
    black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of
    flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces
    and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition
    emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM
    is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is
    stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks
    around - confused.

24  INT.   SAM'S BEDROOM                     MORNING         24

    TIGHT SHOT of telephone. The ringing continues. A hand
    grapples with the receiver. SAM is in bed in a darkened
    room. Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.

                              SAM
               Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr
               Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is
               it?

    There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,
    incorporating an alarm. SAM thumps it. The alarm goes off.
    This sets of a series of other things ... The window
    shutters roll up letting in the morning light. Both taps
    turn on in the bathroom ...

                              SAM
                    (into phone)
               The electronics here are up the
               spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry
               sir - I'll be there.

    SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is
    moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is
    loose he pushes the pin in firmly.
    
    In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting
    room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a
    cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with
    SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM
    comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath
    taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee-
    maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours
    a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this
    we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is
    functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been
    assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are
    built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal
    panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall
    panels have Central Services logos on them with the
    admonition "Do not obstruct or remove" below. SAM has
    livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film
    posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures
    of wide beautiful vistas.

25  INT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION LOBBY     DAY             25

    This is a gigantic, vaguely 30's monumental-style
    building. The lobby is a vast impressive space containing
    reception desks, fountains, statues etc. Prominent are the
    security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras,
    video screens and groups of SECURITY MEN who search all
    who enter. SAM is finishing going through Security when he
    meets JACK who is on his way out of the building.

                             JACK
               Sam!

                              SAM
               Jack!

                             JACK
               Long time no see!

                              SAM
               Well, since you disappeared up the
               ladder of Information Retrieval ... I
               don't expect to see you slumming in
               Records - what's the problem?

                             JACK
               Problem? - No problem - yes,
               everything's going fantastically
               well, wonderful, marvelous, great
               career prospects, Alison in great
               shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm
               on Security Level Five now, and Mr
               Helpmann relies on me more and more,
               yes, couldn't be better, I feel
               terrifically motivated and job-
               rewarded -
               
                              SAM
               You sound worried.

                             JACK
               Me? - if I'm worried about anyone,
               it's you. What happened to you, Sam?
               You were the brightest of us -

    As they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit
    TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering
    the lobby. As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on
    their faces for a frozen CLOSE-UP. JILL has just entered
    and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face. SAM
    happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the
    over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE
    DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being
    replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where
    the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as
    she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so
    there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM
    GIRL. SAM decides he must have imagined it. Over this JACK
    has been talking.

                             JACK
               What's the matter?
                               
                              SAM
               Sorry. Nothing.
                    (snapping out of it)
               See you - I'm going to be late.

                             JACK
                    (looking at his watch)
               You are late.

                              SAM
               Even later.

                             JACK
               Sam, your life is going wrong - let
               your friends tell you - Records is a
               dead end department, no Security
               Level worth a damn, it's impossible
               to get noticed -

                              SAM
               Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous,
               wonderful - remember me to Alison -
               and the - er - twins.

                             JACK
               Triplets.
    
                              SAM
               Really? - God, how time flies!
    
    As SAM heads off to the lift, he passes a group of MEN
    standing around a temporary TV monitor. Several of them
    are dressed in white lab coats. They are being explained
    the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman
    type. His assistant is operating the controls. On the
    monitor we can see JILL standing in the queue for the
    Information desk. The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on
    her.
    
    CUT TO JILL at top of queue with several forms in her
    hand. A strange prototype radio controlled camera on a
    wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches
    her. Throughout the next sequence it pokes around JILL in
    an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying
    to see what is written on the forms, peering over her
    shoulder. JILL hands a form to the Information Porter.
    
                             JILL
               I want to report a wrongful arrest.
    
                            PORTER
                    (looking at form)
               You want Information Adjustments.
               Different department.
    
                             JILL
                    (exasperated but
                    controlled)
               I've been to Information Adjustments.
               They sent me here. They told me you
               had a form I had to fill in.
    
                            PORTER
               Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                            PORTER
               Is it stamped?
    
                             JILL
                    (producing Buttle receipt)
               Stamped?
    
                            PORTER
                    (examining receipt)
               No, there's no stamp on it. You see!
               I can't give you the form until it's
               stamped.
    
                             JILL
               Where do I get it stamped?
    
                            PORTER
               Information Adjustments.
    
    The radio-controlled camera noses right up to JILL's face
    as she turns. She swats the annoying thing with her stack
    of forms as she storms off. The camera overbalances and
    crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.
    
    CUTTING BACK to the GROUP around the monitor we see a
    deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-coated
    TECHNICIANS.
    
    
26  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             26
    
    SAM is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem
    while KURTZMAN looks on anxiously and ineffectually.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Perhaps the machine's on the blink!
               It keeps picking up old films. That
               can't he right, can it?
    
                              SAM
               It's not the machine. There's a
               mismatch on the personnel code
               numbers... Ah there we go! That's a
               B58/732 when it should be a T47/215
               ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06,
               debited against his account for
               electrical procedures, not Buttle.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh my God, a mistake!
    
                              SAM
               It's not our mistake!
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (eagerly)
               Isn't it? Whose is it?
    
                              SAM
               Information Retrieval.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh, good!
    
                              SAM
               Expediting has put in for electrical
               procedures in respect of Buttle,
               Archibald, shoe repair operative, but
               Security has invoiced Admin for
               Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
    
    SAM is still punching keys.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What a relief! I don't know what I'd
               do if you ever got promoted.
    
                              SAM
               Don't worry.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               But if they did promote you
    
                              SAM
               I've told you before. I'd turn it
               down.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Would you really, Sam?
    
                              SAM
               Really.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (churned up)
               You've been promoted.
    
    KURTZMAN hands SAM a sheet of printed paper. SAM takes the
    paper, not pleased, and glances at it.
    
    CLOSE UP of paper: "LOWRY, S. (RECORDS. MIN OF INF.)
    TRANSFER TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL - (Expediting, Security
    Level 3).
    
                           KURTZMAN
               It's your mother isn't it? Pulling
               strings again.
    
                              SAM
                    (explodes)
               What a BITCH!
    
    
27  INT.   DOCTOR'S OFFICE                   DAY             27
    
    CUT TO an old WOMAN's face reflected in triplicate in a
    three-panelled mirror. A pair of MAN's hands have a grip
    on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on
    either side of her face. When I say several inches that's
    just what I mean. Not only are her jowls being stretched
    like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to
    the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth
    her face can be made by DOCTOR who is prattling on over
    this freak show.
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs
               Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here
               ... and there ...
    
    CUT TO WIDE SHOT of DOCTOR's surgery. It looks a bit like
    a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. The
    cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised
    with pastel coloured chintz and satin. At the dressing
    table sits the old WOMAN, SAM'S MOTHER. Behind her stands
    the DOCTOR. He is much like his surgery. He has tailored
    his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. It
    seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself.
    There is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all
    in all he has been fairly successful. SAM is pacing
    around, raving.
    
                              SAM
                    (angrily)
               I just wish you would stop
               interfering, mother! I don't want
               promotion. I'm happy where I am.
    
                            MOTHER
               No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson
               to you - he never had your brains but
               he's got the ambition. You haven't
               got the ambition but luckily you've
               got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann
               was very close -
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now, Mrs Lowry, don't get upset
                    (so SAM)
               Please wait in reception, Mr Lowry,
               you're giving her wrinkles.
    
                            MOTHER
               You see!
    
                              SAM
                    (groans)
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now Mrs Lowry, try to relax. You must
               trust me. I'll make you twenty years
               younger ...
                               
                              SAM
               Huh!
                               
                            DOCTOR
                    (giving Sam a dirty look)
               ... twenty-five if we just drain the
               excess fluid from the pouches ...
    
                            MOTHER
               Dr Jaffe, you're a genius. Would you
               like to be Surgeon General? Four
               Star. I know everybody.
                               
                            DOCTOR
               Well they won't know you when I've
               finished with you.
               
    The DOCTOR reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured
    marker. He starts colouring up her face with strokes of
    different coloured markers.
    
                            DOCTOR
               First we must eliminate the excess
               derma ... so! ... Then the flaccid
               tissues under the eyes ... And now
               the forehead ... Zip! I lift the
               wrinkles and worry lines right up
               into the wi- into the hairline, comme
               ca ...
    
    SAM looks disgusted.
    
                            DOCTOR
               And now the template ... There ...
               there ... there ... Now a bit of
               sticky ... There we go!
                    (triumphantly)
               Already she is twice as beautiful as
               she was before - voila!
    
    The DOCTOR moves his body aside, revealing MRS LOWRY's
    face, covered with coloured lines and wrapped in
    cellophane held in shape by cellotape. SAM stares at her.
    
                              SAM
               My God, it works.
    
    
28  INT.   POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE)        DAY             28
    
    The conversation between SAM and his MOTHER takes place
    while they are going through the sort of security checks
    familiar at airports. They are, however, just outside the
    velvet rope of the posh restaurant.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (in full flow)
               Mr Helpmann was very close to your
               poor father. He was very close to me.
               Still is. He'll take you under his
               wing at Information Retrieval. You'll
               like it when you get there.
    
                              SAM
               You're not listening, mother.
    
    A warning buzzer goes off as MOTHER's handbag goes thru
    security check. It turns out to have been activated by a
    gaily wrapped package. A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it
    and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of
    executive toy which we have seen twice before.
    
                            MOTHER
               It's a present for my son.
    
    She takes the toy back and hands it to SAM.
    
                            MOTHER
               I hope you like it. It's very
               exclusive.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                            MOTHER
               It's something for executives.
    
    At this point the MAITRE D arrives on the scene.
    
                           MAITRE D
               Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you
               again. Merry Christmas.
    
    He pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. He
    looks disdainfully at SAM's unfashionable clerk's suite
    
                            MOTHER
               Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (blocking Sam's way)
               I'm sorry but ...
    
                            MOTHER
               You remember Samuel, my son.
    
                             SPIRO
                    {suddenly unctious)
               Oh, but of course ...
    
                            MOTHER
               We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
    
                              SAM
               Are we?
    
                             SPIRO
               Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
    
    SPIRO leads the way. SAM and his MOTHER follow, across the
    restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza
    New York. Trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring,
    potted palms combine to impress us with their
    sophistication and taste. A string quartet can just be
    made out against the far wall. Except for the unfortunate
    intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting
    across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating
    right through the middle of a particularly valuable-
    looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident
    wealth and breeding. SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their
    way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string
    quartet accompanying them.
    
    CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a
    wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking
    DAUGHTER in her 20s. The OLDER WOMAN is easily
    distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage
    that covers a goodish part of her head. The two of them
    (the MOTHER and DAUGHTER, not the MOTHER and bandage) are
    perusing the menus. SAM notes the DAUGHTER, unpleased.
    
                              SAM
               Mother, I thought we were going to be
               able to talk .... Oh God, she's got
               what's he name with her.
    
    SAM and his MOTHER arrive at the table.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Ida! Sam!
    
                            MOTHER
               Alma, how are you? You're looking
               wonderful! Hello, Shirley.
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (shy to Sam)
               Salt?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (to Shirley)
               Not yet.
                    (to Sam and Mother)
               Happy Christmas, Sam.
    
    She hands SAM a gaily wrapped package which obviously
    contains the same executive toy.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sorry we're late. Shall we order? Get
               it out of the way. What are you going
               to have Alma?
    
    She starts to hunt through the huge menu the MAITRE D has
    just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid
    dishes available.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               I can't make up my mind whether to
               have a number one or a number two.
               What do you recommend, Spiro?
                               
                             SPIRO
                    (conspiratorially)
               Between you and me, Madam, today the
               number two.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are
               you going to have?
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (panics quietly)
    
                             SPIRO
                    (conspiratorially)
               Between you and me, Mademoiselle,
               today the number one. Madam Lowry?
    
                            MOTHER
               Oh, to hell with the diet, a number
               eight, please.
    
                             SPIRO
               A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I
               may say so.
                    (to Sam)
               Monsieur?
    
                              SAM
                    (brusquely)
               A steak, please. Rare.
                    (to his mother)
               Mother, I need to ...
    
                             SPIRO
                    (piqued)
               Monsieur. Quel numero.
    
                              SAM
                    (handing back menu)
               I don't know which numero.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (writing on pad)
               Numero, trois.
    
    
    EVERYONE is a bit embarrassed here. MOTHER gives SAM a
    withering look. SPIRO stalks away.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (trying to restart things)
               Alma, you wicked thing ...
                    (indicating bandages)
               you've started your treatment.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               You noticed.
                    (enthusiastically)
               I must tell you all about it.
    
                              SAM
                    (to his mother)
               Mother, will you listen to
    
    At this moment the food arrives. SPIRO elaborately lifts
    off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the
    plates of food. Each order looks identical - a big splodge
    of brown lumpy stuff. The only differences between the
    lumps are the Identifying photographs on sticks stuck in
    each. The beautiful colour photos match the photos which
    were on the menus.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (showing off that he
                    remembers who's ordered
                    what)
               Numero huit, braised veal in wine
               sauce.
                    (he sets it in front of
                    Sam's Mother)
    
                    MRS TERRAIN
               It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe
               and gone to Dr. Chapman.

               Really, Ida, just because his
               techniques are revolutionary ... I
               don't go around calling Dr Jaffe the
               knife man.

               sound so ...

                          MRS TERRAIN
               That's all right Ida ... it's just
               that he's such an artist. To him,
               cutting is so crude ... so primitive.

               Acid on the other hand, can be used
               for such wonderfully subtle shading,
               such delicate nuances - just like a
               Rembrant etching ... and it's so much
               quicker. Why, if it weren't for a
               teensy-weensy complication - the
               doctor said it could have happened to
               anyone - I would have had these
               bandages off yesterday.

                            SHIRLEY
                    (to Sam, after attracting
                    her mother's attention and
                    receiving a nod)
               Salt?
    
    They are just about to dip into their respective splodges
    when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is
    blasted out of the wall to the kitchen. Chaos erupts
    around the carnage as WAITERS try putting out the flames
    with extinguishers. PEOPLE, bloody and dying, are moaning.
    The DINERS not actually affected by the blast look up for
    a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to
    their meals.
    
    IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXPLOSION.

                            MOTHER
               What were we saying?
    
                              SAM
                    (picking bomb debris out of
                    his brown lump)
               This isn't rare!
    
                            MOTHER
               By the way, I saw a wonderful idea
               for Christmas presents at the
               chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift
               tokens.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Oh, that sounds marvellous.
    
                            MOTHER
               Yes, they're good at any doctor's and
               at many of the major hospitals - and
               they're accepted for gynecological
               complications including Caesarian
               section.
    
    SAM, in the act of taking in another forkful of his
    unappetising meal, drops his form in disgust
    
                              SAM
               Look - please - I'm sorry - but
               honestly, mother, this is -
    
                            MOTHER.
               I quite agree! - It's impossible!
    
    MOTHER raises her arm to gain the attention of the MAITRE
    D who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency.
    The activity in the background has increased throughout
    the conversation. The fire-brigade has arrived with sirens
    blaring. Ministry TROOPS have charged in and are arresting
    WAITERS. Stretchers have been bought in for the injured
    and these are being rushed past our little GROUP's table.
    The MAITRE D comes to the table, his DJ now blood-
    spattered.
    
                           MAITRE D
               I am sorry, Madam ... I don't know
               what to say ... this very rarely
               happens to us - I'll do what I can
               straight away
    
    He hurries away.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Really, Sam - when are you going to
               do something about these terrorists?
    
                              SAM
               What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

                            MOTHER
               Actually, Alma, that's one of the
               little things I was dying to tell you
               ... Sam's been promoted to
               Information Retrieval.

                              SAM
                    (angry and surprised)
               Mother!

                          MRS TERRAIN
               Oh that's wonderful! Congratulations
               Sam...

                            SHIRLEY
               You can show those fucking murderous
               bastards a thing or two.

                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (shocked and embarrassed)
               Shirley!
    
                              SAM
               Stop this!
                    (leaping to his feet)
               I'm not being promoted. I'm not going
               to Information Retrieval!
                    (he scrumples promotion
                    notification which he has
                    been holding and throws it
                    on the floor)
               If I want you to stick your oar in,
               mother, I'll tell you where to stick
               it!
    
    EVERYBODY is shocked. He recovers his composure slightly.
    Embarrassed, he bends, and picks up the ball of paper
    which he starts smoothing back into Its flat state.
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (back to her uncertain
                    form)
               Pepper...?
    
                              SAM
               Look - I've got to get back -
    
    As SAM goes, MAITRE D reappears with a group of WAITERS -
    those remaining unarrested - whom he has organised to gut
    up a folding screen around the table. This cuts of the
    sight if not the noise of the VICTIMS of the explosion.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
    
                              SAM
               I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I
               don't want promotion. I don't want
               anything.
    
                            MOTHER
               Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course
               you want something. You must have
               hopes, wishes, dreams.
    
    Their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to
    rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouts loud)
               NO, NOTHING. NOT EVEN DREAMS!
    
29  EXT.   BRILLIANT SKY                     DAY             29
    
    SAM as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT, his wings straining
    as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the GIRL. They
    are rising up and away from the monolithic stone
    skyscrapers that stretch away below them.
    
                              SAM
               I'm taking you to a safe place. A
               place where they will never be able
               to get at us ... ever.
    
    An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is
    but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming
    a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and
    the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent
    just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic -
    about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he
    comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises
    from the centre of this bizarre place.
    
                              SAM
               There's no way they can approach us
               without being seen. You're safe here.
    
    He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his
    wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a
    terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.
    
    A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere
    beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the
    camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and
    down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is
    heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another.
    All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over
    the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks
    from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at
    right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with
    a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is
    heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding
    against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid
    pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out
    from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in
    its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends
    upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky
    is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is
    frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on
    above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and
    that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after
    block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the
    light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save
    her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the
    platform but it's too late.
    
    Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of
    sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and
    out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be
    heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a
    searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The
    laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something
    black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that
    appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible
    flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.
    
    He is engulfed in the black awfulness.
    
30  INT. SAM'S BEDROOM                       NIGHT           30
    
    SAM is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes. He is
    dripping with sweat and screaming. The room is
    oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat.
    It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's
    stuck.
    
    CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to
    the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to
    be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the
    kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the
    window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath.
    GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in
    through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and
    madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he
    tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He
    makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall
    gasping for air.
    CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back
    as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him
    dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open
    refrigerator. The phone rings at the other end.
    
                              SAM
                    (into phone)
               Hello - Central Services - I'm at
               579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D

               Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover

               Thank you or calling Central
               Services. am sorry, due to temporary
               staff shortage, Central Services

                              SAM
               This is an emergency!
                               
                          PHONE VOICE
               Thank you for calling Central
               Services. I am sorry, due -
    
                              SAM
               Yes, but. I've got to have a heating
               engineer
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Thank you for calling Cen -
    
    SAM slams the phone down.
    
    CUT to SAM sitting in front of the refrigerator. The door
    is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a
    desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head
    slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions
    falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.
    
31  EXT.   DARKNESS                          NIGHT           31
    
    The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are
    not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through
    space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the
    pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch
    cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the
    intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped
    and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected
    by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is
    escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM
    is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the
    tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a
    small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his
    shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way
    and SAM crashes through.
    
    CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He
    catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms
    back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on
    a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch
    he came through was the front of one of the millions of
    files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back
    into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for
    hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other
    walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is
    it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time
    Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being
    tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as
    sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms.
    The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period
    costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a
    sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer
    platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the
    side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN
    (as seen on TV).
    
                             GENT
               Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
    
                              SAM
               What? How do you know my name?
    
                             GENT
               We know everything here. This is the
               Storeroom of Knowledge.
    
                              SAM
                    (climbing onto the
                    platform)
               Then perhaps you can help me. I've
               lost someone who ...
    
                             GENT
                    (interrupting)
               We know that too. You've come to the
               right place.
    
    The platform carries them along the files.
    
                             GENT
               Oh, yes. We've got everything here.
               Every bit of knowledge, wisdom,
               learning ... every experience, every
               thought neatly filed away.
    
                              SAM
                    (incredulous)
               What? You mean you've got ...
    
                             GENT
               Well not exactly. But, if you help us
               we'll help you. The Forces Of
               Darkness have won the day ... but,
               tomorrow is another one
    
                              SAM
               What do I have to do.
    
                             GENT
               You must save the day.
    
    The platform has stopped. The GENT pulls out a drawer. He
    reaches inside.
    
    The GENT pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.
    
                             GENT
               This is the Sword Of Truth ... and
               this the Helmet Of Justice.
    
    As SAM begins to strap on the weapon the GENT brings out a
    cape.
    
                             GENT
               And this. completes the outfit.
    
    He puts the cape around SAM's shoulders and helps him step
    into the drawer. A moment's hesitation and then SAM outs
    the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. It fits just
    like a coffin.. As he lies back the GENT pushes the drawer
    in.
    
                             GENT
               It won't be pleasant but, trust me.
    
    As the drawer is pushed in SAM suffers a sudden bout of
    claustrophobia. Looking up at the diministing opening he
    is surprised to see - not the face of the JOLLY GENT - but
    a terrifying SAMURAI WARRIOR's masked helmet. SAM
    struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.
    
32  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           32
    
    SAM is grabbing the walls of the fridge. Water from the
    defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. He wakes
    up. Before he can really take in where he is the phone
    rings. He staggers over to it.
    
                              SAM
               Hello ... hello ...
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Hello. Mr Lowry?
    
                              SAM
               Who's that?
                    (pause)
    
    A sound at the kitchen door turns SAM's head - and ours -
    just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but
    then a rapid voice in his ear-piece brings his head back.
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Put the phone down and your hands up.
    
                              SAM
                    (into the phone)
               What? Who is this?
    
    SAM realises that the voice is also in the room behind
    him. He turns round and sees TUTTLE. TUTTLE is middle-
    aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes
    suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid
    commando. In one hand he holds a gun pointed at SAM. The
    other hand is holding a telephone receiver which TUTTLE is
    in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his
    feet. SAM puts down his phone, and his hands up.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Nice and easy now. Keep your hands
               where I can see them.
    
                              SAM
               What is this?
                    (indignantly)
               Who the hell are you?
    
    TUTTLE, keeping the gun on SAM, goes to different doors,
    leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.
    
    TUTTLE suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At
               your service.
    
                              SAM
               Tuttle! Are you from Central
               Services?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Ha!!
    
                              SAM
               But ... I called Central Services.
    
                            TUTTLE
               They're a bit overworked these days.
               Luckily I intercepted your call.
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
    By now, BOTH are pouring with sweat.
    TUTTLE heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a
    wall panel.
    
                              SAM
               Wait a minute, what was that business
               with the gun?
    
    TUTTLE hands SAM the panel and plunges his arm into the
    space behind it.
    
                            TUTTLE
               A little precaution, sir. I've had
               traps set for me before now. There
               are people in Central Services who'd
               love to get their hands on Harry
               Tuttle.
    
                              SAM
               Are you saying this is illegal?
    
    By now TUTTLE has managed to pull out some sections of
    flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal
    behind the removed panel. It is all very complicated and
    greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where
    that came from. TUTTLE is amazingly neat and deft as he
    works. A real pro. As he works he hums a wee tune ... yes
    ... BRAZIL!!
    
                            TUTTLE
               Well, yes ... and no. Officially,
               only Central Service operatives are
               supposed to touch this stuff ...
               Could you hold these.
    
                            TUTTLE
                    (he hands Sam a bunch of
                    wires that he has detached)
               ... but, with all the new rules and
               regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon
               ... they can't get decent staff any
               more ... so ... they tend to turn a
               blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.
                    (he hands Sam a torch)
               ... Mind you, if ever they could
               prove I'd been working on their
               equipment ... well, that's a
               different matter ... up a bit with
               the torch, sir.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to
               work for Central Services?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're
               getting warm -
    
                              SAM
               The pace?
    
                            TUTTLE
               The paperwork, couldn't stand the
               paperwork.
                    (indicating the torch)
               Over to the left please, if you don't
               mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's
               more bits of paper in Central
               Services than bits of pipe - read
               this, fill in that, hand in the other
               - listen, this old system of yours
               could be on fire and I couldn't even
               turn on the kitchen tap without
               filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody
               paperwork.
    
                              SAM
                    (mildly)
               Well I suppose one has to expect a
               certain amount
    
                            TUTTLE
               Why? I came into this game for
               adventure - go anywhere, travel
               light, get in, get out, wherever
               there's trouble, a man alone. Now
               they've got the whole country
               sectioned of and you can't move
               without a form. I'm the last of a
               breed. Ah ha! Found it!
                    (he holds up a small
                    charred gadget)
               There's your problem.
    
                              SAM
               Can you fix it?
    
                            TUTTLE
               No. But I can bypass it with one of
               these
    
    He pulls another gadget from his bag.
    
                              SAM
               Fine.
    
    The door bell. TUTTLE grabs for his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Are you expecting anyone?
    
                              SAM
               No. Wait here.
    
    He goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the
    front door which he opens. He is confronted by two
    officious little men in boiler suits who are standing
    outside his door. Their names are SPOOR and DOWSER. DOWSER
    is SPOOR's echo.
    
                              SAM
               Yes?
    
                             SPOOR
               Central Services.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ervices.
    
                              SAM
               Uh - what? - I ...
    
                             SPOOR
               You telephone, sir.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...elephoned sir.
    
                             SPOOR
               Trouble with your air-conditioning.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ditioning.
    
                              SAM
                    (gulps)
               No, not at all. I mean, it's all
               right. It's fixed.
    
                             SPOOR
               Fixed?
    
                            DOWSER
               Fixed?
    
    They don't like that.
    
                              SAM
               I mean it fixed itself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Fixed itself.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ixed itself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Machines don't fix themselves.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... fix themselves.
    
                             SPOOR
               He's tampered with it, Dowser.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ampered. with it, Spoor.
    
                              SAM
               Look, I'm sorry about your wasted
               journey
    
    SAM tries to close the door but SPOOR prevents this.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (to Dowser)
               I think we'd better have a look.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... have a look.
    
                              SAM
               No you can't.
    
    He is pushed aside. SPOOR followed by DOWSER, heads for
    the door behind which is MR TUTTLE. SAM is paralysed.
    SPOOR approaches the door as if it is dangerous. He turns
    the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. The
    door begins to swing slowly open. SAM suddenly finds
    inspiration.
    
                              SAM
               Just a minute!
    
    SPOOR and DOWSER turn round as the door continues to swing
    open. When the door is open, behind their backs TUTTLE is
    seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip, his knees
    slightly bent. TUTTLE freezes like that, pointing his
    pistol through the open door.

                              SAM
               Have you got a 27B/6?
    
    DOWSER looks very angry. Veins stand out on his forehead
    and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit. SPOOR
    knocks him to the ground.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (to Sam)
               Now look what you've done to him.
    
                              SAM
               Have you got one or haven't you?
    
                             SPOOR
               Not ... as such ...
    
    DOWSER moans and begins to get back on his feet.
    
                             SPOOR
               But we can get one.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (worried about Dowser)
               It's all right, Terry, it's all
               right, everything's all right.
    
                              SAM
                    (ushering them to the door)
               I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a
               stickler for paper work. Where would
               we be if we didn't follow the correct
               procedures?
    
                             SPOOR
               We'll be back.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...Be back.
    
                              SAM
                    (Closing the door on them)
               Thank you.
    
    SAM turns back to TUTTLE who is coming forward pocketing
    his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Thanks, Lowry, you're a good man in a
               tight corner.

    TUTTLE returns to work, fitting in the new by-pass gadget
    and tightening the nuts, and happily humming "BRAZIL".
    
                              SAM
               Listen .. um ... I don't want to get
               involved in any of this. But I work
               at the Ministry of Information, and I
               happen to know that Information
               Retrieval have been looking for an
               Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer.
               You wouldn't by any chance be -
    
                            TUTTLE
                    (pleased)
               My friends call me Harry. Information
               Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
    
                              SAM
               What do they want you or?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Time to go.
    
    TUTTLE finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag.
    
                              SAM
               Thank you very much. How much will
               it...?
    
                            TUTTLE
               On the house. You did me a favor.
               Check the corridor.
    
    SAM goes to the front door, opens it and looks out.
    
                              SAM
               All clear.
    
    TUTTLE slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor.
    
                              SAM
               Hey that's a dead end.
    
    But TUTTLE merely undoes a pre-arranged rope and swings
    Tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi-
    story void to a neighboring block. SAM is amazed - not to
    say - stunned.
    
33  INT.   RECORDS POOL                      DAY             33
    
    SAM is at his desk among all the desks. Documents are
    being delivered right, left and centre through the vacuum
    tubes. All the CLERKS are busy. The screens are devoted to
    their proper use. All this activity is explained by the
    fact the MR KURTZMAN's door is wide open. At the next desk
    is another CLERK much like SAM, his NEIGHBOUR.
    
                           NEIGHBOUR
               I think Kurtzman getting is
               suspicious.
    
                              SAM
               What have we got on today?
    
                           NEIGHBOUR
               Casablanca.
    
    KURTZMAN appears in his doorway.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (calls out)
               Mr Lowry! Would you step in here a
               moment please.
    
    We go with KURTZMAN as he closes the office door behind
    him, we are now in ...
    
    
34  INT.   KURTZMAN'S OFFICE                 DAY             34
    
    KURTZMAN is pacing anxiously. SAM walks into the office.
    During the brief opening and closing of the door we just
    manage to hear the piano player in "Casablanca" singing,
    "... a kiss is just a kiss ...". KURTZMAN is too worried
    to notice. He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if
    it were contagious. He waves it frantically as SAM enters.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (hysterically)
               Thank God you're here! We're in
               terrible trouble! Look at this! Look
               at this!
    
    He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking the paper)
               A cheque.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               The refund for Tuttle!
    
                              SAM
                    (startled)
               Tuttle?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion
               from the word go! He's been wrongly
               charged for Electromemorytherapy and
               someone somewhere is trying to make
               us carry the can!
    
                              SAM
               I've never seen a Ministry cheque
               before.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               We've got to get rid of it! There's
               been a balls-up somewhere, and when
               the music stops they'll jump on
               whoever's holding the cheque!
    
                              SAM
               Send it to somebody else. Send it to
               Buttle. It's his cheque.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I've tried that! Population Census
               have got him down as dormanted, the
               Central Collective Storehouse
               computer has got him down as deleted,
               and the Information Retrieval have
               got him down as inoperative ...
               Security has him down as excised.,
               Admin have him down as completed
    
                              SAM
               Hang on.
    
    SAM sits down at the console and punches keys. He does
    this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally
    demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves KURTZMAN
    way out of his depth, until -
    
                              SAM
               He is dead.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll
               never get rid of the damned thing!
               What are we going to do?
    
                              SAM
               Try next of kin.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (a revelation)
               Next of kin!
    
    SAM punches more keys.
    
                              SAM
               There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle.
               What's the number on the cheque?
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (reading it)
               27156789/074328/K.
    
    SAM has been efficiently punching this in.
    
                              SAM
               Into memory. Now ... Central Banking
               ... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit
    
    SAM rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque
    into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. A job well
    done.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (fervently)
               Please don't come back! Please don't
               come back!
    
    Unfortunately KURTZMAN's prayers are not answered and the.
    vacuum tube returns almost immediately. SAM opens it up.
    From the computer screen comes a voice "Play it again,
    Sam" - SAM and KURTZMAN look at the screen. We get a quick
    glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to
    numbers.
    
                              SAM
               Problem. She doesn't have a bank
               account.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (hysterically)
               Well, that's it! I may as well go and
               hang myself! This sort of thing
               couldn't have happened before the
               stupid seventh tier reorganization!
               That was Simmons doing! And he and
               Jeffries always sit together at
               lunch! The bastards!
                    (he thumps his hand hard on
                    the desk top)
               Ow!
                    (He picks up the offending
                    cheque)
               Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the
               filing cabinet ... or destroy it ...
               burn it ... eat it ...
    
    Under this tirade SAM has begun to hum "BRAZIL" - not
    entirely sure what inspired him.
    
                              SAM
               You'd never get away with it.
               Besides, you can't do that to
               somebody's refund. It's Christmas.
               There is one more option.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (depressed. Not really
                    believing it)
               What?
    
                              SAM
               Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the
               cheque, tell her to sign her name on
               the back, cash it at the corner sweet
               shop.
    
    KURTZMAN is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               That's brilliant!
    
    SAM takes over. In no time at all he has battered away at
    the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and
    received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf
    of different coloured papers.
    
                              SAM
               I'll do it for you. Authorise the
               cheque. What's the address?
    
    KURTZMAN scribbles it down for him.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Here. What do I do next?
    
                              SAM
               Call the motor pool and authorise
               personal transport.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Of course, of course. Leave it to me.
               How do I authorize a cheque?
    
                              SAM
                    (separating the and blue
                    sheets)
               Here we are. Pink and blue receipts.
               All you've got to do is sign these
               and the back of the cheque.
    
    KURTZMAN takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers
    but his hand is giving him trouble.
    

                           KURTZMAN
                    (exhausted after all the
                    emotion)
               Oh God! I think I've broken a bone.
               What a pathetic thing I am.

                              SAM
               (taking the pen from him)
               Here.

    SAM signs the cheque and receipts. A big CLOSE UP shows
    that he is scribbling KURTZMAN's signature. SAM pockets
    the papers and the pen.

                              SAM
               That's it.

                           KURTZMAN
               You are good to me Sam.

                              SAM
                    (leaving)
               Don't mention it. See you later.

35  EXT.   MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             35
    CUT to SAM at the wheel of the little car, beetling along
    in a seemingly endless, tube-like tunnel, menaced fore and
    aft by huge buses, lorries and other carriers which
    literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road
    surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck.
    
    CUT to SAM in interior of the Messerschmidt. He is singing
    along to an obscure arrangement of "BRAZIL".
    
                             RADIO
                    (plays music for a moment
                    which then fades out)
               ... We interrupt this programme to
               bring you news of a terrorist bombing
               at the ...
                    (Sam switches off)
    
    
36  EXT.   MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             36
    
    CUT to exterior view of Messerschmidt still merrily
    progressing in arterial tunnel. CUT to very tiny exit
    sign: Exit 49.
    
    CUT to SAM peering at sign.
    
    CUT to Messerschmidt taking the exit just as a huge lorry
    roars by.
    
    
37  EXT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             37
    
    Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the
    sunlight. Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's
    model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre
    of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work -
    graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. In the
    background is the grim reality of the massive housing
    tower. SAM's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow
    of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. Huge
    conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. SAM gets out
    of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a
    few LOCALS. Self-consciously, SAM looks around him, then
    at the paper in his hand. A little group of KIDS sit
    pitching pennies against a wall. SAM goes over to them.
    
                              SAM
                    (super polite)
               Excuse me. Can you tell me ...
    
    But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny KID looks up.
    
                              KID
               Eff off.
    
    SAM, uncomfortably, effs off.
    
    He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the
    little GIRL BUTTTLE. As SAM enters the buildings one of
    the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the
    car. Another is fiddling, with a box of matches.
    
    
38  INT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             38
    
    CUT to SAM hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby
    of the big block of flats. Graffiti, vandalism are in
    evidence everywhere. He walks up to the lift. Pushes the
    button. Nothing happens. He pushes again. This time the
    lift door shudders and sparks. SAM tries to pull the doors
    apart. They jam open with a three-inch gap between them -
    still shuddering and grinding. In the sparking light, SAM
    can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old
    furniture, dead cats. Yechhhh. Resignedly, he turns
    towards the stairs.
    
    
39  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             39
    CUT to SAM coming breathlessly out of the stairwell. On
    the wall next to it is the number 37. Walking down the
    corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but
    then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to
    knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles
    for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly.
    
               SAM
               Mrs Buttle
                    (silence)
               Uh, Mrs Buttle?
                    (silence)
    
    SAM stands not knowing what to do.
    SAM pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts
    about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat.
    CUT to SAM's POV of darkish hall.
    
                              SAM
               Mrs Buttle ...
    
40  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING ROOM               DAY             40
    
    CUT to SAM entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded
    in half-darkness. This is the same flat from which the
    FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is
    still in the ceiling. SAM becomes aware of a woman sitting
    absolutely still at a small table by the only (still
    broken) window in the room.
    
                              SAM
               Are you Mrs Buttle?
    
    The WOMAN nods very slightly without looking at him.
    
                              SAM
               My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I'm
               from the Ministry of Information.
                    (no response)
               I've come to give you a cheque.
    
    SAM takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the
    table to tempt MRS BUTTLE into a flicker of interest but
    she fails to notice it - or him for that matter. SAM
    pushes the cheque a little way towards MRS BUTTLE but she
    does not respond.
    
                              SAM
                    (indicting cheque)
               It's a refund ... I'm afraid there
               was a mistake.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               Mistake?
    
                              SAM
                    (encouraged)
               Yes. Not my department ... I'm only
               records. It seems that Mr Buttle was
               overcharged by Information Retrieval.
               I don't think they usually make
               mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose
               we're all human.
    
    SAM looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.
    
               Oh ... what happened to the ...?
    
    He gets nothing back.
    
               Actually, my bringing this here is
               rather unorthodox ... Usually any
               payments are made through the central
               computer ... but, er ... there were
               certain difficulties, and rather than
               cause delay, we thought you might
               appreciate this now ... it being
               Christmas.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               My husband's dead, isn't he?
    
                              SAM
               Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the
               Ministry is always very scrupulous
               about following up and eradicating
               error. If you have any complaints
               which you'd like to make, I'd be more
               than happy to send you the
               appropriate forms.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               What have you done with his body?
    
                              SAM
               Um ...
    
    MRS BUTTLE starts to cry.
    
                              SAM
               Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
               I don't know anything about it ...
               I'm really just delivering the
               cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind
               signing these receipts
                    (producing blue and pink
                    receipts)
               I'll go and leave you in peace.
    
    SAM picks up the cheque and gives it to MRS BUTTLE
    together with the receipts. MRS BUTTLE tears them up and
    throws them in his face.
    
                              SAM
               Uh ...
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               He hadn't done anything ... He was
               good ... What have you done with his
               body?
    
    SAM looks around for an escape and sees a YOUNG BUTTLE
    standing in the doorway. The BOY is looking at him with a
    blank tearful face. Suddenly the BOY launches himself at
    SAM with terrible ferocity. SAM is knocked against the
    wall. A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the
    floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his
    hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull
    the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on
    his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and
    shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the
    BOY.
    
    From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the
    floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's
    head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is
    unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems
    unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of
    mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now.
    
                             JILL
               Are you alright?
    
                              SAM
                    (mumbles)
               It's you ... it's you ...
    
                             JILL
               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
    
    SAM grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the
    angle so that the vision disappears. He looks for the
    vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to
    realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up,
    dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the
    ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only
    the empty space of the hole.
    
                              SAM
               Wait! Stop! Come back!!
    
    MRS BUTTLE is shouting. SAM rushes out of the flat.
    
    
41  INT.   BUTTLE'S CORRIDOR                 DAY             41
    
    SAM looks both ways and heads for the stairs.
    
    
42  INT.   BUTTLE'S STAIRCASE                DAY             42
    
    SAM runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds
    himself in -
    
    
43  EXT.   SIMILAR CORRIDOR                  DAY             43
    
    He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the
    doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock
    at. He hesitates. He rings the bell on what he hopes is
    the right door. The bell doesn't work. He bangs on the
    door. The door opens a crack. A malevolent eye looks at
    him.
    
                              SAM
               Girl ... fair hair ...
    
    The door shuts firmly. SAM rushes to the next door.
    
    
44  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       DAY             44
    
    SAM bursts into JILL's flat. He sees the hole in the
    floor. The place looks derelict. He hears an explosion and
    looks out of a window to see his car in flames. JILL is
    apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. She is
    carrying a suitcase and bundles.
    
    
45  INT.   STAIRCASE                         DAY             45
    
    SAM rushes down the stairs.
    
    
46  EXT.   BLOCK OF FLATS                    DAY             46
    
    SAM charges out into the open air. JILL has disappeared.
    The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames. SAM doesn't know
    which way to turn. Spotting an old mattress lying by the
    building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an
    attempt to smother the flames. The group of CHILDREN watch
    him silently. Suddenly with a great roar, JILL's lorry
    comes round the corner at speed. SAM sees that JILL is at
    the wheel. SAM runs after the lorry.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouting)
               Wait! It was nothing to do with me!
    
    The lorry roars away. SAM dashes back to his smoldering
    three-wheeler. He flings himself into it and starts it up.
    He also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all
    three wheels have been removed. He turns round in despair
    and sees the group of CHILDREN regarding him
    expressionlessly.
    
    They include the little GIRL BUTTLE.
    
    Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. A
    shadow passes across his face. Looking up he sees GIRL
    BUTTLE standing over him.
    
                              SAM
               Go away.
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Her name is Jill.
    
                              SAM
               What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Layton.
    
                              SAM
               Jill Layton ...
                    (getting up)
               You're a very good little girl. What
               are you doing here?
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               I'm waiting for my daddy.
    
                              SAM
                    (uncomprehending)
               He will be pleased when he comes
               home.
    
    GIRL BUTTLE doesn't answer and SAM starts to walk away.
    After a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back
    to look at the little GIRL BUTTLE who stands alone
    patiently in the vandalised wilderness.
    
    
47  INT.   RECORD CLERKS POOL                DAY             47
    
    It is the end of the work day. The CLERKS are busily
    getting their coats and leaving the office. As the last
    one goes MR. KURTZMAN comes out of his private office with
    his hat and coat on. He turns out the office light. He
    sees SAM isolated in the empty room, still working at his
    computer console. Totally absorbed in what he is doing.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh ... Sam. I've had the transport
               pool onto me ... You don't know
               anything about a personnel
               transporter gone missing do you?
    
    SAM doesn't seem to hear him. On the computer screen is a
    front and side view picture of JILL. Her name and code
    number is at the top of the screen. SAM is punching up
    personal dossier information like "age", "height",
    "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes",
    "distinguishing marks" etc.
    
                              SAM
                    (preoccupied)
               A "personnel" transporter? They've
               got it wrong. I had a personal
               transporter. I'll do the paperwork
               tomorrow -
    
    SAM punches up a few more categories for JILL's dossier.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's
               cheque?
    
                              SAM
               I delivered it.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Can I forget it?
    
                              SAM
               Yes.
    
    SAM punches a few more buttons on the computer.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What a relief!
                    (on reflection)
               I shall probably have nightmares.
    
    At this point the word "Classified" superimposes itself
    over most of the screen and "IRQ/3" starts agitating at
    the bottom
    
                              SAM
               Damn! Blast!
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What's the matter?
    
                              SAM
               You don't happen to know how I can
               get around an IRQ/3 do you?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               All information on 3rd Level Suspects
               is classified.
    
                              SAM
               I know that.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               All enquiries to Information
               Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of
               course. They never tell you anything.
               But come the time they want something
               from us ...
    
    Throughout this verbal wallpaper SAM has been punching
    keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint. He then punches
    in the code for a hard-copy print-out. JILL's two-view
    computer portrait rolls out as SAM ponders his options.
    
                              SAM
                    (cutting off Kurtzman)
               I've go to accept that promotion to
               get behind this, haven't I?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Yes.
                    (realising what he's
                    suggesting)
               NO! You can't! You've only just
               turned it down!
                    (thinking Sam is joking)
    
                              SAM
               I never signed the form.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I did it for you.
    
                              SAM
               What! Shit!
               
                           KURTZMAN
               It's what you wanted isn't it?
    
                              SAM
               Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
    
    KURTZMAN picks up JILL's print-out and glances at it. He
    grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Come on, before they turn the lights
               out.
    
    SAM nods. He turns off the machine. He stands up and
    follows KURTZMAN towards the door. The door is some
    distance away, and before they get there all the lights go
    out. KURTZMAN bumps into a desk and curses.
    
    
48  INT.   TRANSPORT CAGE                    EVENING         48
    
    Packed tightly between other passengers SAM is busy
    drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer
    print-out of JILL turning her into the DREAM GIRL. The
    transport cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a
    tower block.
    
    
49  INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    EVENING         49
    
    The transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end
    of SAM's corridor. Passengers disembark and head for
    various doors along the corridor. SAM almost fails to get
    off in time - so concentrated on JILL's picture is he.
    Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about
    something he heads for his own front door.
    
    
50  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        EVENING         50
    
    SAM enters. The place is in a state of turmoil. Servicing
    panels are off the walls. Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown
    mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was
    disemboweled. SPOOR stands in the middle of it all trying
    to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring
    plans which seem to make little sense to them. DOWSER is
    not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and
    banging going on somewhere behind the wall.
    
                              SAM
               What the - ? How did you - ?
    
                             SPOOR
               Emergency procedures.
    
                         DOWSER (O.S.)
                    (muffled)
               ...ergency procedures.
    
                              SAM
                    (angrily)
               I haven't got an emergency. Get out
               of here.
    
    For reply SPOOR whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag
    and plays back SAM's original phone call to Central
    Services, claiming "an emergency". SPOOR shuts off his
    machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what
    looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper
    between each page. SPOOR indicates the bottom of page 1.
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign here please.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             SPOOR
                    (surprised)
               It's a 27B/6, what did you think it
               was?
    
    SAM takes out KURTZMAN's old-fashioned fountain pen from
    his pocket, signs where indicated. SPOOR registers that
    SAM's signature has hardly penetrated through he first
    carbon let alone the other 43
    
                             SPOOR
                    (sourly)
               Haven't you got a ballpoint?
    
    SAM resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by
    one. SPOOR realises that DOWSER's echo has gone missing.
    
                             SPOOR
               Now where's he got to?
                    (shouts)
               Dowser!
    
    DOWSER bursts through a panel in the wall. This is the
    panel which TUTTLE had removed and replaced. A few of the
    flat's intestines have come out with DOWSER. DOWSER has
    made a find - TUTTLE's spare part.
    
                             SPOOR
               What have you got there?
    
                            DOWSER
                    (highly excited)
               Got there!
    
    DOWSER points to TUTTLE's spare part which is hanging out
    of the wall attached to rubber tube. SPOOR examines this
    closely. SAM watches alarmed. The TWO MEN go into a
    mumbling huddle.
    
                             SPOOR
               Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ...
               Tuttle
    
                            DOWSER
               Mumble ... Tuttle ...
    
                             SPOOR
               Tuttle! ... mumble!
                    (to Sam)
               You've had that scab Tuttle here,
               haven't you?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...aven't you?
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             SPOOR
               Who fixed your ducts?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...your ducts?
    
                              SAM
               I fixed it myself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh
                    (he holds up Tuttle's spare
                    part)
               out yer nostril?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...Yer nostril?
    
                             SPOOR
               Central Services don't take kindly to
               sabotage!
    
                            DOWSER
               ...sabotage!
    
    SPOOR and DOWSER and the other workmen gather up their
    tools - put them in the bag, grab everything else that
    belongs to them and are leaving. SPOOR grabs the form-book
    out of SAM's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that
    page at SAM, shoves the book into his bag. The WORKMEN
    begin leaving the flat.
    
                              SAM
               Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't
               just go and leave it like this!
    
                             SPOOR
                    (mock innocent)
               Why not? All you've got to do is blow
               yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ven't you?
    
                             SPOOR
                    (leaving)
               You're putting your talents to very
               odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to
               pit wits against Central Services -
    
                            DOWSER
               ...sod you, stupid twit.
    
    They go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving SAM in the
    ruins of his flat.
    
    SAM stands in the maimed sitting-room. Wall panels are
    off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room
    like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a
    couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently
    hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the
    print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the
    DREAM GIRL.
    
    
51  EXT.   CONDUIT FOREST                    NIGHT           51
    
    DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to
    reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest
    of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through
    the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him.
    Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering
    before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke
    and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.
    
    
52  EXT.   CLOUDS                            NIGHT           52
    
    CUT to SAM plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape
    twisting around him. Somehow he manages to wrestle it
    clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape
    up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out
    until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent.
    Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.
    
    
53  EXT.   STRANGE LANDSCAPE                 ANTI-DAY        53
    
    SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange
    mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the
    occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long
    lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant
    cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The
    black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the
    PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages.
    The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light.
    The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a
    black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.
    
    CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards
    the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated,
    destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them
    forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a
    stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear
    raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS
    turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach -
    a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We
    see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is
    MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and
    the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback.
    A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the
    sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward.
    But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins
    to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a
    mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and
    the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the
    opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black
    flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high
    into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into
    the light. There, under several meters of the earth's
    crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful
    blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen
    in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the
    crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet
    high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient
    Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he
    made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a
    horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that
    was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of
    Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is
    unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being
    loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face
    the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands
    ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in
    an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does
    the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees
    that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter
    from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the
    ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the
    ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black
    flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the
    trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is
    severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking
    around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned
    cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and
    begins chopping the tethers away.
    The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last
    restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but
    before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg
    halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is
    caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands.
    Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the
    smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The
    face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to
    the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.
    
                   MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND
               Don't go! It's a trap! She's not what
               she seems.
    
    SAM kicks and strains but the hands hold firm.
    
    
54  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           54
    
    SAM wakes up. His feet are entangled in some wiring and
    ducting. He is still in his devastated sitting room. As he
    untangles himself the door bell rings. It takes a moment
    for SAM to recognise it as the door bell. Annoyed and
    still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the
    door. He opens it. In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly
    bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and
    big-bowed tap dancing shoes. She launches into a terrible
    song and dance routine.
    
                        GIRL (singing)
               Mrs Ida Lowry requests the pleasure
                 of your companyyyy
                 at her apartment tonight,
               from eight thirtyyyy
                 midnight
               to celebrate the completion
                 of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy
               The guest of honour will be
                 Mr Conrad Helpmann,
               Dep. Under Minister of State
                 for Public Information,
               R.S.V.P. by singing telegram.
    
    SAM and the GIRL stand looking at each other uneasily for
    a moment.
    
                              SAM
               Er ... Thanks ...
    
                             GIRL
               It's reply paid.
    
                              SAM
               Oh ...
                    (he sings uncertainly)
               Thank you very much, mother, but
               actually -
    
                             GIRL
               You don't have to sing it.
    
                              SAM
               Oh, right ...
    
    The GIRL begins to dance again - but this time in a rather
    strange strangled fashion.
    
                              SAM
                    (he looks at his watch)
               Aren't you a bit late? - the party
               started half an hour ago.
    
                             GIRL
               Yes, I know. It's the backlog,
               everybody complains. Was it all right
               otherwise?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank
               you.
    
                             GIRL
               Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
    
    
55  INT.   MOTHER' S CORRIDOR                NIGHT           55
    
    SAM rings the doorbell to his mother's flat. He is
    wearing. an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie - obviously his
    only dress outfit. The door is opened by a LIVERIED FLUNKY
    who's about to speak when an attractive 40-year old
    woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses SAM
    over the threshold.
    
                             WOMAN
               Sam, I'm so glad you came. Do come
               in.
    
    
56  INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT           56
    
    SAM steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him.
    The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less
    formally dresses than SAM. It is an elegant baroque room -
    lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous
    Central Service ducts that thrust through antique
    tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for
    aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.
    
                              SAM
                    (bewildered)
               Mother? Is that you?
    
                            MOTHER
                    (taking his arm - looking
                    slightly askance at his
                    clothes)
               Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The
               bandages came of this afternoon. Come
               and join the fun. Everybody's here.
    
                              SAM
               Is Mr Helpmann here?
    
                            MOTHER
               Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
    
                              SAM
               I want to talk to him.
    
    SAM pushes away the FLUNKY who is by now passing a metal
    detector over him.
    
                            MOTHER
               It seems you're the first person ever
               to turn down a promotion. He thinks
               you should see a doctor.
    
                              SAM
               Actually, I've decided ...
    
    DR JAFFE hoves into view.
    
                            MOTHER
               Oh, Louis! You know Sam.
    
    DR JAFFE is no longer suave. He has been transformed by
    drink and success. Mostly by drink.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (as high as a kite)
               Can you believe it?! Just me and my
               little knife! Snip - snip - slice -
               slice - Can you believe it?
    
                              SAM
                    (repelled)
               Congratulations ...
    
                           DR JAFFE
               And this is just the beginning!!
    
                              SAM
               Really?
    
                           DR JAFFE
               Chirst yes, you've seen her with her
               clothes off. Faces are a doddle
               compared to tits and arse.
                    (explains)
               No hairline.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (primly)
               Really, Louis.
    
    A handsome young piece of BEEFCAKE delivers a drink to
    MOTHER.
    
                           BEEFCAKE
               I've been looking everywhere for you,
               Ida.
    
    The BEEFCAKE takes MOTHER away.
    
                           DR JAFFE
               Ah, dear boy ... And what do you
               think of your mother now?
    
                      VOICE (off camera)
               It will never last.
    
    SAM and DR JAFFE turn to see who is speaking. It is DR
    CHAPMAN a tall, pipe-smoking, professional-looking gent.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (a trifle haughtily)
               Excuse me, Dr Chapman, did you say
               something?
    
                          DR CHAPMAN
               That technique ... I've tried it. A
               nice effect. But highly unstable. In
               six months she'll look like Grandma
               Moses.
    
    SAM wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but
    suddenly freezes - the reflection in the large wall mirror
    next to him is not that of the party guests - but of the
    GREY PRISONERS in his dream - they are massed in the room
    looking pleadingly towards him.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (unsuave again)
               Now see here, Chapman. At least mine
               don't look like they've been mugged.
    
    Through the GREY PRISONERS pushes MRS TERRAIN.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (calls)
               Sam!
    
    SAM turns around to see her pushing through the party
    guests.
    
    MRS TERRAIN is limping and is even more heavily swathed in
    bandages than the last time.
    
    DR CHAPMAN hastily moves away as MRS TERRAIN comes up. She
    claims SAM, taking his arm.
    
                              SAM
                    (looking at her worriedly)
               Whatever happened to you?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               There was a slight complication. Dr.
               Chapman says it often happens with a
               delicate skin like mine. Nothing to
               worry about. He's promised me I'll
               have these bandages off in a ...
                               
                              SAM
                    (trying to disengage)
               Actually, there's someone I want to
               meet ...
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (roguishly)
               I know, I know ...!
               
    She drags SAM through the party and we arrive at her
    daughter, SHIRLEY, who is, of course, a wallflower.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Here we are! I'm going to leave you
               two lovebirds in peace.
    
                              SAM
               I ... uh ...
    
    But he is alone with SHIRLEY, standing at the entrance to
    his MOTHER's embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom.
    In amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed
    MOTHER is playing hide and seek with a YOUNG STUD.
    
                              SAM
               Can I get you a drink, Shirley?
    
    SHIRLEY looks at him terrified.
    
                              SAM
               Look ... Shirley ... your mother ...
               and my mother ... they seem to have
               got the idea ... I mean, I'm terribly
               flattered, of course, but, um, the
               thing is, I don't want you to be
               under any false ...
                               
                            SHIRLEY
                    {struggling into speech
                    shyly)
               It's ... it's ... all right ... I
               don't like you either ...
    
    This isn't what SAM expected. He smiles weakly at her.
    
                      VOICE (off camera)
               Sam!
    
    SAM turns round, to see JACK LINT a few paces away.
    
                              SAM
               Hello, Jack!
    
                             JACK
               You remember Alison?
    
    He indicates his cute blonde perfect junior executive's
    WIFE
    
                              SAM
               Hello, Alison. You look different.
    
                            ALISON
               Well, I'm two years older.
    
                             JACK
               And she's been to Dr. Jaffe!
    
    ALISON locks displeased.
    
                             JACK
                    {winking at Sam)
               She doesn't like me telling anyone
               but she's pleased as anything really.
    
                              SAM
               Er, I knew you looked different.
                               
                             JACK
               Remember how they used to stick out?
    
                              SAM
               What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to
               wonder if they were real.
    
                            ALISON
               What, my ears?
    
                              SAM
               Your ears?
    
                             JACK
               Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
    
                              SAM
                    (covering up hopelessly)
               Quite, absolutely - I always thought
               they were false.
    
                             JACK
                    (looking past Sam)
               Mr Helpmann!
    
    SAM spins round and sees a very pleasant-looking
    distinguished OLD MAN moving in their direction. He is in
    a wheelchair.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Hello, Jack.
    
                             JACK
               You remember my wife ... Alis -
    
                           HELPMANN
               Of course. Barbara isn't it? How are
               you?
                            ALISON
               Um ...
    
                             JACK
                    (instantly. Conveying to
                    Alison that she mustn't
                    object)
               Barbara's very well, thank you, sir.
               How are you?
    
                           HELPMANN
               Fine, thank you. Hello, Sam. Ida said
               you might be here. Have you got a
               minute?
                    (to Jack)
               Would you excuse us?
    
    JACK is taken aback, envious and eager to please.
    
                             JACK
               Of course .... of course ... Come on
               Alison - Barbara
    
    JACK propels his WIFE away.
    
    HELPMANN I need your help, Sam.
    
    
57  INT.   BATHROOM                          NIGHT           57
    
    It's the sort of bathroom you would expect of MOTHER, an
    adjunct to her boudoir. The pink or purple lavatory is in
    the process of flushing, while SAM holds MR HELPMANN
    vertical, grasping him under the armpits, while MR
    HELPMANN is zipping his fly.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Thanks very much Sam.
    
                              SAM
               That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to
               help.
    
    He is lowering HELPMANN into the wheelchair.
    
                           HELPMANN
               If I can help you ...
    
                              SAM
                    (broaching the subject)
               Well, I ...
    
    In maneuvering HELPMANN SAM clumsily knocks over one of
    the pretty pots which fussily decorate MOTHER's bathroom
    shelf. A thin layer of powder is spread over the wash-
    stand.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry ...
    
                           HELPMANN
               Your father and I were very close. Of
               course Jeremiah was senior to me but
               we were close friends ... especially
               after the bombing
                    (he indicates his legs)
               and I
                    (chuckles)
               keep his name alive at the office
               every day.
    
    With his finger HELPMANN is tracing letters in the
    powdered surface.
    
                           HELPMANN
               It's as though he's there speaking to
               me - "'ere I am, J.H.!" The ghost in
               the machine.
    
    We see that HELPMANN has traced the letters EREIAMJH in
    the powder.
    
                           HELPMANN
               I know he would have wanted me to
               help you ... And I promised your
               mother I'd take you onto the team at
               information Retrieval. But I gather
               that ...
    
                              SAM
               Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind.
               I'd like to accept the transfer - am
               I too late?
    
                           HELPMANN
               Too late? That's for me to say.
                               
                              SAM
               Well ... well, I ...
    
    HELPMANN puts out his hand. SAM takes it.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Welcome to Information Retrieval!
    
    HELPMANN blows away the spilled powder and EREIAMJH with
    it.

59  INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY         DAY             59
    
    CUT to WIDE SHOT of massive imposing lobby - much like the
    Records lobby - but this one is very austere. No crowds.
    No statues. No decoration. Not even the ever-present
    security checks. Impressive. And a bit unnerving. Framed
    in the doorway is a lone TINY FIGURE. CUT to CLOSE UP.
    It's SAM. He hesitates and then enters. CUT to video
    screen. The video camera follows SAM across the lobby -
    til he stops in tight profile at Reception Desk. We tilt
    up revealing SAM standing facing us just beyond the
    monitor which is on the desk.
    
                              SAM
                    (diffidently to the porter)
               My name is Sam Lowry. I have to
               report to Mr Warren.
    
                            PORTER
                    (looking down his nose at
                    Sam's unsleek clerk's suit
                    and then handing him an
                    I.D. badge)
               Thirtieth floor, sir. You're
               expected.
    
                              SAM
               Er, don't you want to search me?
    
                            PORTER
               No, sir.
    
                              SAM
                    (taken aback. Reaching into
                    his pocket)
               My I.D. cards.
    
                            PORTER
               No need, sir
    
                              SAM
                    (nonplussed)
               But I could be anybody.
    
                            PORTER
               No you couldn't, sir. This is
               Information Retrieval.
                    (indicating to the right)
               the lift's arrived, sir.
    
    
60  INT.   30TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             60
    
    SAM steps out of the lift.The lift doors close. SAM looks
    up and down the corridor hearing nothing. Silence. Then
    he, and we, begin to hear a sound. It is a curious
    whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be
    growing closer. Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into
    view around a corner at the far end of the rather long
    corridor. At the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a
    magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. This
    is MR WARREN. He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are
    competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of
    sentences. MR WARREN is snapping out decisions. Satisfied
    EXPEDITERS drop out of the scrum at intervals,
    disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors
    which line both sides of the corridor.The scrum doesn't
    get any smaller because new EXPEDITERS dart out of other
    doors and join the milling MOB. The whole circus is coming
    by SAM at the rate of knots. The sound it makes breaks
    down into something like this.
    
                          EXPEDITER 1
                    (waving pager)
               Mr Warren, this order ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 2
                    (waving same)
               Mr Warren ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 3
                    (ditto)
               About this invoice ... Victim's list
               ...
    
                            WARREN
                    (dealing on all sides)
               Yes ... No ... send that back ...
               wrong department ... of course ... of
               course not ... yes ... no ... maybe.
    
    CUT to SAM watching this caravanserai with awe as it
    starts pass him.
    
                          EXPEDITER 4
               ... about these requisitions ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 5
               Mr Warren ... EX/27 has 15 suspects
               still outstanding.
    
                          EXPEDITER 6
               ... a decision, Mr Warren ...
    
                            WARREN
               ... cancel that ... okay ... put half
               as terrorists, the rest as victims
               ... yes ... yes ... no ... definitely
               no ...
    
    SAM doesn't have the nerve to jump into this. The scrum
    sweeps by and fades away along the corridor, and finally
    disappearing around the corner at the other end. SAM
    follows. Silence has descended again.
    
    
61  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             61
    
    SAM gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar
    corridor at right angles. He hesitates and continues. Then
    he starts to hear the sound again. It is coming up from
    behind. MR WARREN has circumnavigated the building. The
    same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace.
    As the scrum reaches SAM he gathers his nerve and jumps
    right in beside WARREN, and keeps going.
    
                              SAM
                    (in a hurry)
               I'm Lowry, Mr Warren ... Sam Lowry.
    
                            WARREN
                    (putting arm around Sam)
               Ah. Lowry ... yes.
                    (still dealing with
                    Expediters)
               ... no, cancel that ... glad to have
               you aboard ... yes ... no ... don't
               be ridiculous Jenkins ... Yes, yes,
               yes ... you'll like it up here ...
               send that back ... we've got a crack
               team of ... are they kidding? ...
               decision makers ... No, in triplicate
               ... I'm expecting big things ... two
               copies to Finance ... of you ... send
               that to Security ... uh, uh, uh.
                    (poring over forms)
               Uh, don't let Progress see this ...
               between you and me, Lowry, this ...
               no, no ... department ... tell
               Records to get stuffed ... is about
               to be upgraded and ...
    
    WARREN suddenly pivots around, swinging SAM 240 degrees in
    the direction they came from plus a bit.
    
                            WARREN
               Ah, here we are!
                    (they are standing facing a
                    door - one of the hundreds
                    of identical doors lining
                    these corridors)
               What do you think?
    
    The door says: OFFICER DZ/015.
    
    SAM has no idea what he ought to say.
    
                            WARREN
                    (solemnly)
               Your very own number... on your very
               own door ... and behind that door
                    (he turns the knob and
                    opens the door)
               ... your very own office.
               Congratulations, DZ/015, welcome to
               the team.
    
    WARREN whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and EXPEDITERS
    leaving SAM standing dumfounded at the entrance to his
    office.
    
    CUT to SAM's POV of the office. It is about four feet
    wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is
    bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side
    wall. The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which
    is also bisected by the new wall. Pneumatic tubes hang
    from the ceiling. SAM slowly enters the room.
    
    
62  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             62
    
    SAM looks lost ... disoriented. He doesn't know where to
    begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes
    in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do
    starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. There in his
    "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -
    gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas &
    Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up
    his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)
    against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM
    turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they
    both fall over with a "plop". Puzzled, he stands the books
    up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". Same result.
    Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before
    his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,
    and "plop", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold
    of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the
    wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,
    somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly
    pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.
    Intrigued, SAM gets up, goes around his desk and heads for
    the door.
    
    
63  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             63
    
    Cut to SAM coming out of his office, turning right and
    walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads:
    OFFICER DV/048.
    
    As is his custom, SAM opens the door without knocking.
    
    
63a INT.   LIME'S OFFICE                     DAY            63a
    
    CUT to SAM'S POV. Here is an office much like his. It's
    the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall.
    The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking,
    round-headed little JUNIOR EXECUTIVE wholly occupied with
    trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. He
    is unaware of SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Hello.
    
    LIME startled, lets go of his desk and vents his
    irritation on SAM whom he mistakes for someone else.
    
                             LIME
               No, you can't have any more chairs!
               There's only one left in here now,
               and I need that to sit on!
                    (realizing his mistake)
               Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
    
                              SAM
               Sam Lowry.
    
                             LIME
                    (becoming unctuous)
               Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next
               door, ha ha!
                    (he advances toward Sam
                    with hand out to shake.
                    Shaking hands)
               My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome
               to Expediting.
    
                              SAM
               Ah.
                    (he pauses - looking
                    around)
               Would you mind if I borrowed your
               computer console?
    
                             LIME
               What?
    
                              SAM
               I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
    
                             LIME
               You want to take my console into your
               office?
    
                              SAM
               Yes.
    
                             LIME
                    (after a moment's
                    consideration)
               I'll tell you what .... You tell me
               what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of
               a whizz on this thing.
                    (indicates computer
                    console)
    
    SAM hesitates, but sees that there's no other way.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking print-out on Jill
                    from his pocket)
               Alright. There's someone I want to
               check out. A woman called Gillian
               Layton.
    
                             LIME
                    (leering)
               A woman eh? I see.
    
                              SAM
                    (trying to ignore this)
               I know her age and distinguishing
               marks. But I need an address or a
               place of work or something
    
                             LIME
                    (continuing to leer)
               This is your dream girl, is it?
    
                              SAM
                    (taken aback)
               What?
                    (recovering)
               Look, let me use the console for a
               few minutes.
    
                             LIME
                    (trying to be jocular)
               You must be joking -
                    (entirely unconvincing)
               When there's a woman involved -
               there's no stopping me. Now, let me
               have that sheet.
    
    He takes Jill's print-out sheet from SAM and begins to
    punch the keys laboriously with one finger. Nothing
    happens.
    
                             LIME
               Sod it, it's broken!
    
                              SAM
               You haven't switched it on.
    
                             LIME
               Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off,
               standing there! Go back to your
               office and I'll give you a knock when
               I've finished.
    
    SAM hesitates, but goes.
    
                             LIME
               Go on. I'm not going to elope with
               her.
    
    SAM exits.
    
    
64  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             64
    
    SAM is sitting in his office listening to the protracted
    one finger exercise which is going on next door. He stares
    dumbly at the shining, absolutely useless, executive toy.
    
    
65  EXT.   ICY SEA                           ANTI-DAY        65
    
    The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV
    as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming
    wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.
    
    As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing
    heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer
    still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.
    Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,
    but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a
    massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is
    engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the
    ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after
    course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we
    continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is
    looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an
    opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts
    out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and
    managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing
    thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark
    passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself
    teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull
    and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs
    curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow
    shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks
    and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM
    gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but
    his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far
    below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of
    grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks
    and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back
    and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the
    ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another
    boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as
    the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches
    at the wall.
    
    
66  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY            66
    
    SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office. The
    boom repeats. LIME is knocking on the other side. SAM
    leaps up. As he leaves his office he looks back to see the
    desk creep through to LIME's office a little bit more.
    
67  INT.   LIME'S OFFICE                     DAY             67
    SAM enters. LIME is standing, proudly holding out a sheet
    of paper.
    
                             LIME
               Computers are my forte.
    
                              SAM
                    (reading)
               Gillian Layton, age twenty three,
               eyes, blue, hair, black, weight, one
               hundred and twenty-one pounds,
               distinguishing marks, blemish on
               right shoulder, scar on left elbow
    
    He stops, having come to the end. He looks at the other
    side of the paper but there's nothing there.
    
    Is this all you got?
    
                             LIME
               It's a start isn't it.
                              SAM
                    (disbelieving)
               But I already knew this!
               
                             LIME
               Best to take it slowly where some
               women are concerned.
    
    SAM sits on LIME's chair and deftly punches the computer
    keys.
    
                             LIME
               Hey - that's my desk!
    
                              SAM
                    (working quickly)
               Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173.
               Truck driver! All enquiries,
               reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.
                    (switching off the machine
                    and getting up)
               That's what I wanted to know. Thank
               you very much.
    
    
68  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY            68
    
    SAM heads off down corridor. WARREN & CO. appear.
    
                            WARREN
               Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you ...
                    (he continues to deal with
                    expediters in between
                    dealing with Sam)
               No, send it back for ... Are you
               settling down? ... I want this order
               rescinded ... There's a query on a
               personnel transporter you took out
               from the pool ... Tell them no, tell
               them yes, ... or was it a personnel
               carrier you took out from
               transportation ... Send that up to
               Security ... Some kind of eight-wheel-
               half-track, was it? ... Tell him I
               want to see him ... Send round the
               paperwork, Lowry ... Arrange a
               conference on that one ... Anyway,
               tidy it up, Lowry, there's a good
               chap - get a new suit. Did you want
               the lift?
    
    The cavalcade is passing the lifts. SAM backs away into
    the open lift. The cavalcade passes on out of sight. The
    lift contains a CHARLADY with a bucket and mop. She
    remains in the lift as SAM joins her.
    
    
69  INT.   THE LIFT                          69
    
    SAM presses the button for the 50th floor. The lift doors
    close on him and the CHARLADY. From somewhere far away
    there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. SAM glances
    around the lift. There appears to be an air conditioning
    vent in the ceiling.
    
    SAM glances enquiringly at the CHARLADY who merely smiles
    at him. Another scream is heard.
    
                              SAM
               What's that?
    
    The CHARLADY smiles again.
    
               Doesn't that disturb you?
    
    The CHARLADY fiddles with something in her ears and pulls
    out a pair of wax earplugs.
    
                           CHARLADY
               Beg your pardon?
    
    The lift arrives.
    
    
70  INT.   50TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             70
    
    The lift arrives. SAM steps out. The CHARLADY remains in
    the lift. The doors close. SAM heads down surgically clean
    white-tiled corridor.
    
    Passing a white-coated TECHNICIAN monitoring what appears
    to be electric meters, SAM comes to a door with 5001.
    Above the door a red light is glowing. SAM knocks. The red
    light goes out and a green light comes on. SAM enters.
    
    
71  INT.   ROOM 500l                         DAY             71
    
    Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but
    the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-
    looking FEMALE typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and
    typing with great facility. SAM approaches the TYPIST who,
    busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently
    mouths the words ...
    
                            TYPIST
               It won't be long now.
                    (she carries on typing)
                    
    SAM nods, and stands quietly by her. He can hear tiny
    sounds coming through her headphones. He looks down at the
    piece of paper in the typewriter. He reacts a bit
    strangely, perhaps even winces. We see he close up of the
    words being struck crisply on paper.
    
                         ON TYPEWRITER
               AHHHH, Oh God ... No, don't ... UHH,
               please ... I ... STOP!! I can't stand
               ... AIIEEEE.
    
                            TYPIST
                    (quietly, still typing)
               Can I help you?
    
    She is looking at SAM helpfully, holding one of the
    earphones away from her ear. From this earphone we can
    just hear quietly ...
    
                           EARPHONE
               Oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ...
               arrrrrghhhh no ... please ... Oh God,
               No ... No, stop, I don't know ...
    
                              SAM
               I'm looking for Officer 412/L.
    
    The TYPIST nods smiling. She puts back the earphone and
    carries on typing.
    
                            TYPIST
               I'm sure he won't be long now.
    
    She types a little more but suddenly stops.
    
                         I thought so!
    
    She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and
    carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all
    the different copies.
    
    Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area,
    SAM can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn
    left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the TYPIST as he exits
    from sight. She is charmed. Almost immediately after them,
    a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits, but to the left.
    
                            TYPIST
               You can go in now.
    
    
72  INT.   JACK'S OFFICE                     DAY            72
    
    SAM goes through the glass door and is about to push open
    the double doors in front of him. He is halted by a noise
    from the TYPIST - she indicates that he is to go to the
    left. He does so and enters an office. An antique desk
    with a large collection of executive toys and other
    tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a
    rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall
    of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from
    entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently
    successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the
    wash basin in the far corner. The Information Retrieval
    TECHNICIAN is standing by a sink massing his temples with
    old-fashioned scalp vibrators. His back to us.
    
                              SAM
               Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?
    
    The TECHNICIAN makes no sign of having heard this. He
    continues vibrating his temples.
    
                              SAM
                    (a bit louder)
               Er, excuse me!
    
    Getting no response SAM walks over to the TECHNICIAN. As
    he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face
    down on the desk top. It seems strangely familiar - but as
    it is a negative concave image SAM isn't sure. He
    continues over to the TECHNICIAN.
    
                              SAM
                    (louder)
               Excuse me.
    
    He touches the TECHNICIAN on the shoulder, who jumps with
    a start. He spins around and turns out to be none other
    than JACK LINT. He is amazed to see SAM.
    
                              SAM
                    (surprised)
               Jack!!
    
                             JACK
                    (recovering slightly)
               SAM! What a surprise!
    
                              SAM
                    (even more surprised)
               Are you officer 412/L?
    
    JACK looks confused. He pauses, and then removes ear
    plugs.
    
                             JACK
                    (shaking Sam's hand)
               Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told
               me you were coming aboard -
               congratulations!
    
                              SAM
               Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
    
                             JACK
               For my sins. Are you settling in
               alright?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, thanks.
    
                             JACK
               Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped
               by. Unfortunately, I don't have any
               time right now I've got a queue of
               customers to deal with - er, why
               don't we have a drink tonight?
    
                              SAM
                     (diffidently)
               Ah ...
    
                             JACK
               What?
    
                              SAM
               I don't want to take up your time
               now, but I was hoping you could give
               me some information on somebody. It's
               a security level three matter and
               Information Retrieval records says to
               refer to you.
    
                             JACK
               OK. Come back this afternoon, about
               four o'clock. If you give me the
               number of the case, I'll have the
               dossier here waiting.
                    (he pulls card from his
                    pocket - pushes it towards
                    Sam)
               My tailor,... well worth the
               investment.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking print-out sheets
                    from his pocket)
               I've got numbers all over these - I'm
               not sure which is the one you want.
    
                             JACK
                    (looking at the print-out
                    picture of Jill over Sam's
                    shoulder)
               Layton! Oh shit!
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             JACK
               You clever bastard! I might have
               guessed. You only moved in today and
               you're already hot on the bloody
               trail.
    
                              SAM
    Am I?
    
                             JACK
    Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other
    on this one. If you make a reputation with this case,
    it'll be at my expense.
    
                              SAM
               How do you mean?
    
                             JACK
               How much do you know?
    
                              SAM
               Not much.
    
                             JACK
               Enough though, eh?
    
                              SAM
                    (getting sucked into this
                    exchange)
               Not really, no.
    
    JACK goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full
    blast, splashing the water noisily into the basin.
    
                             JACK
               OK. OK. Let's not fence around ...
               This is the situation. Some idiot
               somewhere in the building, some
               insect, confused two of our clients,
               B58/732 and T47/215.
    
                              SAM
               B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
    
                             JACK
               Christ! You do know it all!
    
                              SAM
               No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning
               Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
    
                             JACK
               Well, your A. Buttle has been
               confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle.
               I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should
               be shot for that. So B58/732 was
               pulled in by mistake.
    
                              SAM
               You got the wrong man.
    
                             JACK
                    (a little heated)
               I did not get the wrong man. I got
               the right man. The wrong man was
               delivered to me as the right man! I
               accepted him, on trust, as the right
               man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to
               the confusion, he died on us. Which,
               had he been the right man, he
               wouldn't have done.
    
                              SAM
               You killed him?
    
                             JACK
                    (annoyed)
               Sam, there are very rigid parameters
               laid down to avoid that event but
               Buttle's heart condition did not
               appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think
               I'm dismissing this business, Sam.
               I've lost a week's sleep over it
               already.
                               
                              SAM
               I'm sure you have
    
                             JACK
               There are some real bastards in this
               department who don't mind breaking a
               few eggs to make an omelette, but
               thank God there are the new boys like
               me who want to maintain decent
               civilized standards of terrorist
               eradication. We've got the upper hand
               for the moment, but they're waiting
               for us to slip up, and a little slip-
               up like this is just the chance
               they're looking for.
    
                              SAM
               So how ...?
    
                             JACK
               What I've got to do now is pick up
               Tuttle, interrogate him at the same
               voltage as Buttle, to the same meter
               reading to the last penny, and juggle
               the books in electrical banking.
    
                              SAM
               What has Tuttle done?
    
                             JACK
               We suspect him of freelance
               subversion.
    
                              SAM
                    (dumbly)
               He's a freelance subversive?
    
                             JACK
               He's a compulsive heating engineer. A
               maverick ex-Central Service repair
               man with a grudge against society.
               Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of
               the wood, I think. At least we will
               be when I get this Layton woman under
               arrest.
    
    JACK turns off taps and goes behind screen.
    
                              SAM
                    (agitated)
               What's she done?
    
                             JACK
               You didn't know as much about this
               business as you pretended to, did
               you?
    
                              SAM
               Er ... no.
    
                             JACK
               Very smart.
    
                              SAM
               Er ... but I would've found out
               anyway.
    
                             JACK
               Yes. I'm impressed.
    
                              SAM
                    (playing the game)
               Tell me about Layton.
    
                             JACK
               She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the
               Buttle arrest - and since then she's
               been making wild allegations,
               obviously trying to exploit the
               situation - she's working for
               somebody, and she's not working for
               us.
    
                              SAM
               A terrorist?
    
    JACK comes from behind the screen with a look confirming
    just what SAM fears, and hands him a suit.
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... thanks.
    
    SAM begins to put the suit on.
    
                              SAM
                    (hesitantly)
               But surely, I mean, perhaps she just
               happened to live above the Buttles,
               and ...
    
                             JACK
                    (picking up photograph of
                    wife and kids from his
                    desk)
               Look after that suit, eh. Barbara
               chose it for me.
    
                              SAM
               Right. Er, you're not going to keep
               calling her Barbara, are you?
    
                             JACK
               Barbara's a perfectly good name,
               isn't it?
    
                              SAM
                    (preferring to let his
                    drop)
               Look, about the Layton woman - maybe
               she's just trying to help the Buttle
               family.
    
                             JACK
               Why?
    
                              SAM
               Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
    
                             JACK
                    {baffled)
               I don't follow you.
    
                              SAM
               Out of kindness.
    
                             JACK
                    (utterly baffled)
               Kindness? What's the purpose behind
               this line of enquiry?
    
                              SAM
                    (deciding to abandon this
                    line of country)
               So what are you going to do about
               her?
    
                             JACK
               Get her out of circulation - I've put
               her on the detention list.
    
                              SAM
                    (thinking fast)
               You mean you're going to invite her
               in so that she can spill the beans
               inside the department?
    
                             JACK
                    (taken aback)
               Well, I ... Good point. What do you
               suggest?
    
                              SAM
               Let me try to get to her. I'll
               deactivate her.
    
                             JACK
               What does that mean? I don't want to
               be involved in anything unsavoury.
    
                              SAM
               Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
    
                             JACK
               Of course. We went to school
               together. You're my oldest friend.
    
                              SAM
               And you're mine.
    
                             JACK
               You're the only person I can trust.
    
                              SAM
               Then we'd better keep this business
               just between the two of us.
    
                             JACK
               Right! Just between as and the
               Security Forces.
    
                              SAM
               They weren't at school with us.
    
                             JACK
               But, I've already put her on the
               search and detain list.
    
                              SAM
               Take her off the list.
    
                             JACK
               There's no procedure for that until
               she's been arrested.
    
                              SAM
               Say it was a mistake.
    
                             JACK
               We don't make mistakes.
    
                              SAM
               Well, I'd better get out there and
               try to get to her before security
               does. Let me borrow her dossier for a
               while.
    
                             JACK
               Er ... alright. For Christ's sake
               don't lose it. Here, you'd better
               sign for it.
    
    JACK presents SAM with something to sign. He then gives
    him the dossier.
    
                              SAM
               Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
    
                             JACK
               Do you know what you're doing.
    
                              SAM
                    (about to say no, then
                    pauses)
               Trust me.
    
                             JACK
                    (admiring Sam's new look)
               Sam ... we're proud to have you at
               Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas.
                    (he hands Sam another
                    executive package)
    
    
73  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY            73
    
    SAM steps out of Room 5001, newly suited with old suit
    over arm. TWO GUARDS are guiding a BAGGEE down the
    corridor ahead of him. Suddenly, the BAGGEE breaks away
    from his GUARDS and begins to cannonball down the corridor
    directly at SAM. SAM is flattened against the wall as the
    BAGGEE rockets by.
    
    CUT to GUARDS strolling past SAM.
    CUT to BAGGEE running full tilt to the end of the
    corridor, smashing into the wall, bouncing back, getting
    up (now cross-ways in the corridor), bouncing off that
    wall, then the wall behind him, then ...
    
    
74  INT.   LIFT                              DAY            74
    
    Slightly unnerved, SAM gets in the lift, pushes the button
    for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing
    JILL's dossier. The lift descends. But unnoticed by SAM
    continued past his floor without stopping. It stops at the
    Lobby Mezzanine. SAM looks up and realizes he is on the
    wrong floor. Angrily he pushes the correct floor number
    but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice
    echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the
    direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing
    with the PORTER.
    
                             JILL
               But you've stamped this form before!
               Why won't you stamp it now?
    
                            PORTER
               You've just said yourself, Miss,
               we've already stamped it. Why should
               we stamp it twice?
    
    SAM is frozen. He can't believe what he sees. The lift
    doors close. SAM is too slow to stop them. Madly he pushes
    the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this
    point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross
    between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille
    doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall
    in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of
    dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the
    Ministry.)
    
    SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see
    SAM descending. He is shouting and rattling the bars of
    the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention.
    SAM sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying
    to stop the demon lift. From his POV we see JILL
    disappearing from view still arguing with the PORTER.
    
    
75  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            75
    
    The lift comes to rest. SAM is still trying to get it to
    respond and return him to the lobby. TWO TECHNICIANS are
    waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them
    hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the
    buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of
    the lift and is able to read the sign - "LIFT OUT OF
    ORDER". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All
    the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off
    to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it
    he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but
    there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. Before
    he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.
    
                             VOICE
               Hey, you - get out of there.
    
    A GUARD approaches looking tough and mean.
    
                             GUARD
               What do you think you're doing ...
               that's the Deputy Minister's lift.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
    
                             GUARD
               Hold on, sonny ... let's see your
               I.D.
    
    SAM fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to
    the lobby before JILL leaves. He has forgotten he is
    wearing his new I.D. badge. The GUARD can't see it because
    JILL's dossier is covering it.
    
                              SAM
               Shit ... it's here somewhere. My
               name's Lowry, Sam Lowry - Expediting
               ... can't this wait?
    
                             GUARD
               No, sir ...
                    (getting out book of forms)
               I'm going to have to file a report on
               this. Now ... what date is it
               today?...
    
    SAM gives up trying to find his I.D. card.
    
                              SAM
                    (frantic)
               Sorry, it'll have to wait.
    
    He runs off - dropping suit - towards some stairs he has
    spotted.
    
                             GUARD
               Stop!! Come back!
    
    He starts to run after SAM. TWO OTHER GUARDS also give
    chase.
    
    
75a INT.   STAIRS                            DAY           75a
    
    SAM scrambles up the stairs. GUARDS in pursuit.
    
    
76  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            76
    
    The original GUARD rushes over to a guard desk and inserts
    key into cover of what is clearly an alarm button.
    
    
77  INT.   STAIRS                            DAY             77
    
    SAM still running.
    
    
78  INT.   LOBBY                             DAY             78
    
    JILL is still arguing with PORTER.
    
                             JILL
                    (sweetly)
               You're a stupid, fat arsed,
               obstructive, fascist moron aren't
               you?
    
                            PORTER
               If you say so.
    
                             JILL
               You think these are tits don't you?
    
                            PORTER
               Ah.
    
                             JILL
               I bet you'd like to touch them?
    
                            PORTER
               Oh.
    
                             JILL
               Well don't. You're looking at twenty
               pounds of high explosive! And if you
               don't stamp this form I'm going to
               blow the place up!
    
    JILL thumps the desk with her fist.
    
    
79  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY             79
    
    The GUARD throws the alarm switch.
    
    
80  INT.   LOBBY                             DAY            80
    
    Alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily
    armed GUARDS leap out, their guns trained on JILL as she
    appears to be the only person around.
    
                             GUARD
                    (shouting)
               DROP IT!!
    
    JILL has only the form in her hand - which she dutifully
    drops. She is terrified by the suddenness and size of the
    response to her hitting the desk. The GUARDS close in.
    
    SAM rushes out of the door leading to the stairs. He can't
    believe the sight that greets him. He responds
    instinctively,
    
                              SAM
               STOP! Let her go!
    
    He rushes over to the Porter's desk just as the GUARDS
    behind him come through the door. He doesn't have a clue
    what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of
    GUARDS they snap attention. Confused he looks around and
    then realizes his I.D. badge, is on his lapel and the
    GUARDS are responding as trained. The GUARDS chasing him
    screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to
    attention. Everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant
    to make the next move. SAM breaks the silence.
    
                              SAM
               Well done ... uh ... excellent work
               ... quick thinking. I'll take charge
               of her now ...
    
    Realising he has JILL's dossier, he shows it to everyone -
    her print-out pictures are on the front page.
    It's a classified matter ... I'll include your fine
    handling of the situation in my report
    
    SAM is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive
    toy present - he hands it to the PORTER.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing Jill)
               Come with me, please.
    
    He hustles her towards the door.
    
    
81  EXT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL BUILDING    DAY             81
    
    SAM marches JILL out of the main door and down the front
    steps of the Information Retrieval building. As he
    struggles with her some of the papers in the dossier slip
    out unbeknownst to SAM and leave a trail of litter behind
    them.
    
                             JILL
               Who are you? Let go!
    
                              SAM
               Don't look back! Act naturally!
    
                             JILL
               How can I act naturally, when you've
               trying to break my arm?
    
    CUT to the POV of the Ministry of Information front door
    GUARDS. They are looking down the steps at the retreating
    backs of SAM and JILL who are jostling each other. The
    GUARDS see JILL elbow SAM in the ribs.
    
                              SAM
                    (wincing)
               Ow! That hurt!
    
                             JILL
               Good!
    
                       VOICE FROM BEHIND
               STOP! Come back here!
    
                              SAM
               Oh, God ... no!
    
    He turns around, knowing that the game is up. But instead
    of one of the GUARDS shouting - it's an OLD LADY angrily
    glaring at him and pointing to a "Keep your city tidy"
    sign above a litter bin.
    
                           OLD LADY
                    (screaming)
               Can't you read english? You
               illiterate foreign pig! You come here
               from your own filthy country and
               think you can mess our streets up!
               You should be fried alive, you dirty
               verminous ... etc. etc.
    
    SAM sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the
    pavement. He lets go of JILL for a moment to grab at the
    papers. The LADY continues screaming at him, her little
    Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his
    bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping SAM's new trousers.
    SAM is torn between trying to regain the pages of the
    dossier and following JILL who has disappeared round the
    corner. He gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after
    JILL.
    
    CUTTING back to the TWO GUARDS, who have been observing
    all this bizarre activity, we see one of them reading one
    of the pieces of paper.
    
                          OTHER GUARD
               Hey, you shouldn't be reading that
               it's classified.
    
    
82  EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            DAY             82
    
    JILL is behind the steering wheel of her lorry which is
    just starting to move off. SAM frantically runs towards
    the lorry, leaps on the running board and pulls himself up
    into the cab.
    
    
83  INT.   LORRY CAB                         DAY            83
    
                              SAM
                    (climbing in)
               Well done, that's it ... Let's go!
               Vrmmm. Vrmmm.
    
    SAM looks up and down his side of the street anxiously
    before realizing that JILL has switched off the engine and
    is sitting glaring at him. They are stopped, right in
    front of the Ministry building.
    
                              SAM
                    (frantic)
               What are you doing? For Christ's
               sake! Get moving!
    
                             JILL
               Who are you?
    
    Desperately SAM pulls roller blind down over window.
    
                              SAM
                    (hurriedly)
               Sam Lowry. Hello. This sounds insane,
               I know, but I've been dreaming about
               you. Even before I saw you you were
               in my dreams. Weird isn't it. I mean
               ... I don't know what it means ...
               but it might mean something ...
               mightn't it? I hope so. Anyway you're
               in danger and I think we should get
               out of here, now, quick! Come on!
    
    Still JILL does nothing. SAM pulls down roller blind over.
    window.
    
                              SAM
                    (desperate)
               Bloody hell! Do as I say!
    
                             JILL
                    (hard, icy cool)
               No.
    
                              SAM
                    (beginning to lose his
                    bottle)
               Please!
    
    JILL continues to sit, glaring.
    
    SAM delves into his pockets and drags out a handful of
    I.D. cards and papers, most of which fall onto the floor.
    He then remembers that the badge he's looking for is
    pinned to his jacket. He thrusts it forward at JILL.
    
                              SAM
                    (beside himself with panic)
               Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm
               Information Retrieval Officer -
                    (he checks the number
                    somewhere. On the badge?)
               DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for -
               your own good! Now start up and get
               moving before I hand you back to
               them!
                    (indicating M.I. building)
    
                             JILL
               Them?
    
                              SAM
               Us. Them. I don't know ... just get
               going.
    
    JILL starts up and moves off, very cool, in her own time.
    By now SAM has got the shakes.
    
                             JILL
                    (indicting the papers that
                    Sam has dropped)
               Don't litter my cab!
    
                              SAM
                    (picking them up)
               Oh, sorry.
    
    
84  EXT.   CITY FREEWAY                      DAY            84
    
    A high shot of the lorry, moving through the city among
    traffic.
    
    
85  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  DAY            85
    
    JILL is preoccupied with driving. She is smoking a
    cigarette. SAM occasionally glances at her.
    
                              SAM
               ... This is amazing ... for me ...
               being here with you. I mean, in my
               dreams you ...
    
                             JILL
               I don't want to hear about your
               fucking dreams!
    
                              SAM
               Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted
               at you.
    
                             JILL
                    (mainly to herself)
               Why are they all pigs at Information
               Retrieval?
    
                              SAM
               I don't know.
                    (realizing that this
                    includes him)
               Hey, that's not a very nice thing to
               say.
    
    JILL blows smoke in SAM's direction.
    
                              SAM
                    (waving the smoke away)
               You know, smoking's bad for you.
    
                             JILL
               It's my fucking life.
    
                              SAM
                    (winding down the window)
               Yes, of course. Sorry.
    
                             JILL
                    (lighting up another
                    cigarette)
               I know you. I saw you through the
               floor, didn't I?
    
                              SAM
               Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
    
                             JILL
               I didn't run away. I left the flat.
    
                              SAM
               Why?
    
                             JILL
               I didn't like it.
    
                              SAM
               Why not?
    
                             JILL
               It had a hole in the floor. Where are
               we going?
    
                             JILL
               Where are you taking me?
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             JILL
               Where are you taking me?
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're
               taking me.
    
                             JILL
               It does doesn't it?
    
                              SAM
                    (slightly worried)
               Where are you taking me?
    
    
86  EXT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  86
    
    We PULL BACK and lift off to see that the beautiful
    countryside through which we've been travelling is in fact
    a solid wall of giant bill-boards, advertising all sorts
    of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper, sea spray
    flavored cigarettes - you name it - These advertisements
    form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels.
    From a bird's eye POV we see that the land behind the
    hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc.
    
    
87  EXT.   POWER PLANT            DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)      87
    
    The power plant is an extensive, brutal, Dante's Inferno
    of a landscape made mainly of steel ... towers, chimneys,
    huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters ... It
    is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and
    forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. In the
    murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective
    clothing and hard hats.
    
    This is the world which is now entered by JILL's lorry ...
    The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and
    JILL jumps down from the cab. SAM stays inside, looking
    around. Something catches his eye.
    
    CUT to facade of house. Window boxes with flowers and
    shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide
    domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a MAN with
    protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his
    face. He is waving to someone. Slowly the house rises out
    of frame.
    
    In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and
    a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled
    with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. It is lowered onto
    the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one
    of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of
    the power plant.
    
    
88  INT.   LORRY CAB                         DAY             88
    
    SAM watches JILL walk away from the lorry and enter the
    despatcher's hut. He looks around uneasily and then he
    start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a
    compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. He
    gets grease on sleeve of his suit. In the space behind the
    seats he finds the pieces of luggage which JILL had
    carried away from the flat. He starts to examine this
    cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the
    cab door.
    
                             JILL
               Don't act guilty. Act like me. I'm
               just getting on with my job. Or, are
               you just getting on with yours?
    
    JILL gets into the cab and closes the door and drives to a
    forward looking position.
    
                              SAM
               What's going on here?
    
                             JILL
               What does it look like ... I'm
               collecting empties.
               
    The lorry stops and JILL gets out. From SAM'S P.O.V., the
    house suspended from the crane starts moving through the
    sky towards the lorry. He glances back to see JILL slip a
    package out from behind the seat. She glances
    surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel
    inside her jacket she walks away.
    
    
89  EXT.   LORRY                             LATE AFTERNOON 89
    
    SAM climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on
    JILL. He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot
    standard. The picture on it - though faded by pollution -
    is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by
    the murk and mess of the power plant. JILL has made her
    way over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the
    corner of one of the metal structures. They appear to be
    exchanging parcels. SAM is worried by this suspicious
    behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on
    the side of the building that illustrates, almost
    identically, the action we have just seen along with the
    warning: "MIND THAT PARCEL. EAGLE EYES CAN SAVE A LIFE".
    
    CUT to the house being lowered and secured onto the lorry.
    
    
90  INT.   LORRY CAB                         LATE AFTERNOON 90
    
    JILL is starting up the lorry. SAM is glancing over her
    shoulder at the suspicious parcel which is tucked behind
    her. They move off. The last view of the power plant is of
    a group of MEN all in protective clothing and masks
    happily playing a game of volleyball.
    
    
91  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  LATER AFTERNOON91
    
                              SAM
               OK. What's in the parcel?
    
                             JILL
               What parcel?
    
    SAM nods knowingly in the direction of the parcel.
    JILL I don't know. Christmas present.
    SAM picks it up.
    
                              SAM
               It's heavy.
    
                             JILL
               A heavy Christmas present.
    
    He glances at her suspiciously.
    
                             JILL
               Open it if you don't trust me.
    
    SAM hesitates and puts the parcel down.
    
                              SAM
               I'd rather trust you.
    
    
    JILL gives him a quizzical look and smiles slightly, in
    spite of herself. She turns away so that he won't notice.
    
    
92  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY IN CITY TRAFFIC  DUSK           92
    
                             JILL
               What are you doing in Information
               Retrieval?
    
                              SAM
               Looking for you.
    
                             JILL
               No, really.
    
                              SAM
               Really.
    
                             JILL
               I mean, it doesn't suit you.
    
                              SAM
                    (looking at his jacket)
               Suit me?
    
                             JILL
               Don't you know the sort of thing that
               Information Retrieval does?
    
                              SAM
               What do you mean? Would you rather
               have terrorists?
    
                             JILL
               We've got both.
    
                              SAM
               Things would be worse without
               Information Retrieval.
    
                             JILL
               They couldn't be worse for the
               Buttles.
    
    SAM is at a loss.
    
                             JILL
               Why don't you say, no system is
               perfect.
    
                              SAM
               Well, no system is.
    
                             JILL
               Say, all wars have innocent victims.
    
                              SAM
               Well, all wars do -
    
                             JILL
               Who is this war against, Sam?
    
                              SAM
               Well, terrorists of course.
    
                             JILL
               How many terrorists have you met?
               Actual terrorists?
    
                              SAM
               Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's
               only my first day.
    
    JILL bursts out laughing. SAM joins in. They are both
    laughing hysterically as they approach the Central
    Supplies depot.
    
    
93  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK            93
    
    The impression is that the place could be an abandoned
    airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose
    contents is arranged in a grid pattern of "streets", all
    the streets being lined by stacks, piles, ranks, jumbles
    of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily
    grouped, some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated
    houses) standing in the open others protected under simple
    areas of roofing. Each group of Assorted Supplies lies
    inside the squares of the grid of streets. The streets are
    eerily lit by lights just being switched on, and each
    square is also lit by harsh localized lighting. The effect
    is a nightmarish gigantic Aladdin's cave of black shadows
    and garishly lit mountains of stuff.
    
    
94  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK           94
    
    JILL's lorry starts down one of the "streets".
    
                             JILL
                    (as they pass a clock in
                    "C"s)
               Look at that - right on time.
    
                              SAM
               What? I thought you were free to come
               and go as you please.
    
                             JILL
               Well, almost ... unfortunately I do
               have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
    
                              SAM
                    (slightly surprised)
               Every day?
    
                              SAM
               Turn around!
    
                             JILL
               What?
    
                              SAM
               They'll be there waiting.
    
                             JILL
               Who will?
    
                              SAM
               Security.
    
                             JILL
               You're joking.
    
                              SAM
               No. Please. They're going to arrest
               you.
    
                             JILL
               I thought you arrested me.
    
                              SAM
               Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
                    (he grabs for the emergency
                    brake)
    
                             JILL
                    (pushing his hand away)
               Cut it out, Sam.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing at the steering
                    wheel)
               Will you please turn back.
    
                             JILL
                    (shoving him back)
               Get away!
    
                              SAM
                    (lunging for the steering
                    wheel)
               Turn!
    
                             JILL
                    (unable to control him)
               Stop it ... damn you!
    
    SAM throws the lorry into a gut-sucking skid.
    
    
95  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           95
    
    The lorry skids around a corner and roars down a side
    street of containers.
    
    
96  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK            96
    
    SAM and JILL are fighting for control of the lorry.
    
                             JILL
               You're mad! You're out of your mind!
    
    At that moment the air is split apart by the wail of
    sirens. SAM and JILL look back.
    
    
97  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           97
    
    From inside two strategically placed wooden containers
    stacked amongst the piles of containers marked
    "AUTOMOBILES" burst forth two Security vehicles. Wood
    flying, lights flashing, wheels smoking - they squeal away
    in pursuit.
    
    
98  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK           98
    
                              SAM
               I was right! Step on it!
    
                             JILL
               Let go! We've got to stop!
    
                              SAM
               Now you're the one that's out of your
               mind.
    
                             JILL
               Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll
               kill us!
    
    They struggle for control of the lorry.
    
    
99  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           99
    
    The lorry rumbles down the street of containers lurching
    from side to side as the battle in the cab wages back and
    forth. Containers are smashed open and their contents
    spill out only to be further damaged as the pursuing
    Security vehicles crash through them. The lorry escapes
    from the streets of containers and cannons through the
    main gate and out on to the streets of the city.
    
    
100 INT.   LORRY CAB                         DUSK          100
    
    SAM and JILL are still struggling violently for control of
    the lorry. SAM is terribly inexpert as a driver but he
    behaves like someone possessed. Through the rear view
    mirrors he can see the Security vehicles catching up with
    them. He starts fumbling with he multiple gear levers.
    
                             JILL
               Don't touch those!
    
    
101 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREETS                  DUSK           101
    
    The lorry roars down a street of terraced houses and then
    screeches around a corner.
    
    
102 INT.   LORRY                             DUSK          102
    
    SAM pushes JILL's hand back and grabs for the lever that
    he thinks is overdrive. But rather than gaining speed
    there is a terrible lurch as the house and trailer
    disconnect from the cab.
    
    
103 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          103
    
    The house slides off the trailer which is skidding
    sideways and crunches to the ground just as the Security
    vehicles round the corner.
    
    
104 INT.   SECURITY VEHICLE                  DUSK          104
    
    From behind the DRIVER we can see that the house has
    settled across the roadway at right-angle to the other
    houses, making it appear to be a normal dead end street.
    So shocked is the DRIVER that he fails to stop in time and
    KABLOW!! the car smashes into the house.
    
    
105 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          105
    
    Hot on the heels of the 1st car, the 2nd vehicle skids and
    then smashes into the house which collapses and then
    explodes in flames.
    
    
106 INT.   JILL'S LORRY                      DUSK          106
    
    SAM sits paralysed with shock. The lorry has come to a
    halt. JILL is desperately trying to get him to move.
    
                             JILL
               Come on, let's go! Let's get out of
               here!
    
                              SAM
               Oh God! What have we done?
    
                             JILL
               We? Don't blame me!
    
                              SAM
               It wasn't supposed to happen like
               this.
    
                             JILL
                    (looking behind)
               Shit! The house is on fire!
    
                              SAM
               "And your children all gone."
    
                             JILL
               What?
    
                              SAM
               "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home,
               your house is on fire and your
               children all gone" ... Do you think
               anyone's hurt?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
                    (tapping him on the
                    forehead)
               Come out, I know you're in there
    
    
107 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          107
    
    A Security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the
    streets. We roar along with it as it rounds a corner and
    skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from
    JILL's lorry. Heavily armed SECURITY POLICE pour out and
    take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever
    other cover is available. Searchlights are played on the
    lorry. The OFFICER IN CHARGE appears with a loud-hailer.
    
                       OFFICER IN CHARGE
               Come out, we know you're in there!
               You cannot possibly escape. Throw
               your weapons from your vehicle and
               come out slowly with your hands on
               your heads. Obey my instructions and
               no harm will come to you. But if you
               force us to shoot we'll shoot to
               kill.
    
    During the above speech a SMALL BOY on a tricycle "roars"
    around a corner behind the SECURITY POLICE. He rides into
    a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and "takes
    cover" behind it. He points his toy rifle at JILL's lorry
    and takes shot. In reaction to the noise made by the kid's
    rifle the OFFICER IN CHARGE dives for cover and the
    SECURITY TROOPS open fire and pepper JILL's lorry cab with
    holes. A few of the SECURITY TROOPS then rush forward and
    fling open the cab door. The cab is empty. The OFFICER IN
    CHARGE gets to his feet and looks about. His uniform is
    covered with dust, oil and shit from the street. He just
    misses seeing the back of the BOY as he disappears round
    the corner on his tricycle.
    
    
108 INT.   LINGERIE DEPARTMENT/SHOPPING CENTRE              108
    
    To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering
    sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. As we
    slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of
    exotic occasions we come upon SAM and JILL pushing a
    shopping trolley. In the trolley is the "suspicious"
    parcel which JILL was given at the power plant.
    
                              SAM
               This is a hell of a time to buy a
               nightie.
    
                             JILL
               Are you still following me?
    
                              SAM
               Please, Jill ... I love you.
    
                             JILL
               Go away.
    
                              SAM
               There are plenty of other safe
               places. Why don't we go back to my
               flat?
    
                             JILL
               Leave me alone!
    
                              SAM
               You've got to trust me. It sounds
               silly but I know we were meant to
               meet.
    
                             JILL
               You mean you were meant to hijack my
               truck, make me crash it, and have
               every security man in town looking
               for me?
    
                              SAM
               I vas just trying to help. I decided
               to trust you. Maybe I was wrong.
               Whose side are you on really? Who are
               your friends? Who was the man who
               gave you the parcel? What's in it?
               It's the only thing you saved from
               the lorry .... It must he something
               very special.
    
                             JILL
               I saved you from the lorry and you're
               not very special.
    
                              SAM
               ........... It's a bomb isn't it?
    
                             JILL
                    (exasperated)
               Oh ... Jesus!
    
    SAM grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start
    tearing it open.
    
                              SAM
               I'm going to open it!
    
                             JILL
                    (grabbing parcel and trying
                    to take it from him)
               No you're not!
    
    They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. SAM's
    suit gets slightly ripped. Their tug-of-war is interrupted
    by a voice off camera.
    
                             VOICE
               SAM!!
    
    SAM turns to see MRS TERRAIN and SHIRLEY a short distance
    away. MRS TERRAIN is heavily bandaged and sitting in a
    wheelchair which SHIRLEY is pushing.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               It's me and Shirley!
    
    From the TERRAINS' POV SAM looks as if he is wrestling
    with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full
    length mirror. The mirror or something obscures JILL. MRS
    TERRAIN and SHIRLEY exchange puzzled looks and proceed
    toward SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets
               go of the parcel and pushes JILL
               away. She moves off.
    
                              SAM
                    (after Jill for Mrs
                    Terrain's benefit)
               I think that'll hold it.
                    (to Shirley)
               Hello Shirley. Just helping someone
               tie up a Christmas present. How are
               you?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               My complication had a complication,
               but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up
               and bouncing about like a young
               gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas
               present for your mother?
    
                              SAM
                    (Trying to keep an eye on
                    Jill who is disappearing
                    from sight)
               Er, yes ...
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Shirley and I come here regularly. I
               love romantic lingerie.
    
    She unwraps a set of red and black, fur trimmed things
    with strategic holes in them.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (coyly)
               Picture me in these.
    
    At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far
    corner of the store. It is the corner that we last saw
    JILL moving towards. SAM races towards the smoke, dust
    covering his suit. He finds bras, knickers, broken shop
    dummies, bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over
    the place. On the edge of this devastated area he sees
    JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and
    plaster dust. He rushes over to her.
    
                              SAM
                           (frantic)
               Are you alright?
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                              SAM
                    (anxiety giving way to
                    anger)
               You don't deserve to be! You should
               be dead, or maimed like them .... How
               could you ...?
                    (indicating the wounded)
               What a bloody stupid thing ... I
               should. have made you open it in the
               lorry
    
    She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it
    open. Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured.
    Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys.
    She throws the parcel and its contents hard into SAM's
    chest. He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with
    the severed limbs of a shop dummy.
    
                             JILL
               There's your bomb! Our annual bribes
               for official ass-holes like you!
    
    SAM sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved. Liquor
    oozes from the broken bottle all over SAM's suit. He is at
    a loss for words.
    
    JILL's attention is attracted by moans coming from the
    badly hurt BOMB VICTIMS. She goes to help them.
    
                             JILL
                    (to Sam)
               Come on, make yourself useful, there
               are people hurt!
               
    JILL goes around trying to make the INJURED comfortable.
    SAM follows her. He takes off his jacket with his
    Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to
    make a pillow for one of these VICTIMS. By now sirens are
    wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is
    general pandemonium. SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and
    begin arresting everyone, including the DEAD and INJURED.
    ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom JILL is
    attending.
    
                             JILL
               Hey stop ... she's hurt!
    
    The GUARD gives JILL a thump in the side of the face with
    his gloved hand. SAM sees red.
    
                              SAM
               DON'T TOUCH HER!!
    
    The GUARD looks up and as he does so he is transformed
    into the GIANT WARRIOR from SAM's dream. He towers over
    the WOUNDED, the DYING and the debris of the blasted
    lingerie department. SAM grabs for a weapon and comes up
    with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. It
    makes a passable club.
    
                             JILL
               SAM .... don't!!
    
    The TWO COMBATANTS square off ... looking for an opening
    ... a chink in the other's defences - at which point SAM
    is flattened from behind by a TROOPER's gun butt.
    
    
108a       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY108a
    
    SAM is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship. He
    tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing
    descent. With a thud he hits the bottom. Stunned, bruised
    and battered he tries to get up. Standing over him are the
    GREY PRISONERS. They press forward.
    
                              SAM
                    (feebly)
               Where is she? Is she here?
    
    The GREY PRISONERS dissolve into what looks like several
    BAGGEES.
    
    
109 INT.   BLACK MARIA                       EVENING       109
    
    The BAGGEES hang from a track on the ceiling of the Black
    Maria. SAM is lying on the floor, covered by his jacket,
    with his badge prominently displayed. He is dazed and
    mumbling ... the only BAGGEE in the wagon apart from TWO
    GUARDS who have removed their helmets and are relaxing
    while travelling back to base.
    
                            GUARD A
                    (scratching his head)
               These helmets don't half make your
               scalp itch.
    
                            GUARD B
               Ooh, don't mention it.
                    (beginning to scratch his
                    head)
               And they make you sweat. Half the
               time I can't see where I'm going -
               there's a great Niagara of
               perspiration coming down.
    
                            GUARD A
               I'm lucky, I've got thick eyebrows.
               That keeps it up and channels it out
               to my ears.
    
    SAM stirs and groans
    
                            GUARD B
               Who's he?
    
                            GUARD A
               Someone from Information Retrieval
               they're always hanging about in
               lingerie.
    
    SAM is coming to his senses. He takes in the situation,
    sees all the BAGGEES and staggers to his knees.
    
                              SAM
               Jill! Jill! Are you there?!
    
    He begins rummaging through the BAGGEES. ONE of which is
    dressed as FATHER CHRISTMAS. SAM opens the "face vent" of
    the BAGGEE'S' hoods. A pair of strange eyes look out.
    
                            GUARD A
               Excuse me, sir - that's government
               property.
    
                              SAM
               Is here a girl here? Tall, fair hair,
               blue eyes?
    
                            GUARD A
               Dunno sir. They check all that at the
               depot.
    
    SAM continues fumbling about the BAGGEES.
    
                            GUARD 3
                      (pulling Sam back)
               We can't allow you to do that sir,
               it's more than our job's worth.
    
                              SAM
                    (shaking Guard off)
               I've got to find her! Jill! Jill!
    
                            GUARD A
               You can always fill in an application
               form, if you're a relative, sir.
               Please stop, sir.
    
    SAM takes no notice.
    
                              SAM
               Jill! Jill!
    
    GUARD A hits SAM, knocking him out again.
    
                            GUARD A
               Sorry about that sir. Regulations.
               We'll have you safely back in your
               office in no time.

112 INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      EVENING       112
    
    SAM recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his
    desk in his office. He is bruised and battered and has a
    black eye. His suit is torn and bloody. MR WARREN is
    gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture.
    Behind WARREN, crowding the doorway, are the PEOPLE who
    circulate around him and are the cast of the WARREN high
    energy circus. LIME is with them.
    
                            WARREN
               This is a black eye for the
               department, Lowry! ... And I don't
               care how you behaved when you were at
               Records! Information Retrieval is an
               executive branch! We're proud of our
               reputation and we protect it!
    
    One of his ACCOLYTES thrusts a paper into his hand - he
    glances at it.
    
               Damn it, Lowry, that convoy of troop
               carriers is still not accounted for
               ... I thought I told you to deal with
               it.
    
    He slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with
    other forms.
    
               And what the hell is this mess? An
               empty desk is an efficient desk.
    
    He has picked up some of the forms.
    
               Good God! ... queries from Security,
               searches from Central Banking about a
               cheque, clarification notices from
               Accounting concerning unreturned
               receipts, another demand from the
               Motor Pool.
    
                              SAM
               Mr Warren ... I have to find out
               about ...
                               
                            WARREN
               Shut up! I don't know what's going on
               here, Lowry, but don't think you can
               intimidate us with your friends and
               relatives in high places! Now shape
               up!
    
    He dumps the papers and folders onto SAM's desk and storms
    off with his ENTOURAGE, leaving a gleeful LIME in the
    doorway.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing Lime as he starts
                    to slip away)
               Lime, I need to use your computer
    
                             LIME
               Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.
                    (he indicates Sam's
                    smothered desk)
               You seem to have quite a lot to do
               yourself.
                    (he disappears into his
                    office)
    
    
112a       INT.                              30TH FLOOR
CORRIDOR   DAY                               112a
    
    SAM rushes out of his office after LIME. But, LIME has
    locked his door. SAM bangs on the door.
    
                              SAM
               Shit!
    
    
112b       INT.                              SAM'S OFFICE   DAY112b
    
    SAM storms back into his office. Reaching a peak of
    frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the
    pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion. Within
    seconds it returns. SAM sends it off a second time. It
    doesn't return a second time, periodically something
    passes through the tubes causing them to move. SAM's
    pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up.
    At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep
    through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it.
    There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM
    smiles. Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and
    then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside SAM's
    office door. It shakes the whole building. SAM goes to his
    door and opens it.
    
    
113 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    CONTINUATION  113
    
    Every door in the corridor has been opened by the
    occupants of the room. All the occupants stick their heads
    into the corridor, all gazing with SAM at the variously
    coloured blizzard of paper which has errupted through the
    whole length of the corridor ceiling, from which protrudes
    the intestines of the pneumatic system.
    
    
114 INT.   JACK'S OFFICE CORRIDOR & INFORMATION         EVENING114
           RETRIEVAL CORRIDORS
    
    It is the end of the working day. JACK is leaving for
    home. He is putting on his executive-styled bullet-proof
    vest and packing his "Secret Connection" briefcase. As the
    scene progresses SAM and JACK proceed out of the door and
    down he corridor, passing other I.R. OFFICIALS. SAM is
    dishevelled and causing acute sartorial embarrassment to
    JACK to is trying to distance himself from him.
    
                              SAM
               Come off it, Jack! Of course you can
               check to see if she's been arrested.
    
                             JACK
               I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole
               case has become much more complicated
               since last we talked.
    
                              SAM
                    (exasperated)
               She's innocent, Jack --- she's done
               nothing wrong.
    
                             JACK
               Tell that to the wives of the
               Security men she blew up this
               afternoon. Listen, we've also had a
               report just in from Central Services
               that Tuttle has wrecked an entire
               flat and sabotaged adjacent Central
               Services systems - as a matter of
               fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes
               open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
    
                              SAM
                    (catching up with Jack)
               You don't really think Tuttle and the
               girl are in league?
    
                             JACK
               I do. Goodbye.
                    (steps into lift)
    
    
115 INT.   LIFT                              EVENING       115
    
                              SAM
               It could all be coincidental.
    
                             JACK
               There are no coincidences, Sam.
               Everything's connected, all along the
               line. Cause and effect. That's the
               beauty of it. Our job is to trace the
               connections and reveal them.
                    (whispers)
               This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion
               was obviously planned from the
               inside. Bye bye.
    
    
116 INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY         EVENING        116
    
    JACK and SAM have just emerged from the lift. The lift
    doors close. SAM agitatedly speaks.
    
                              SAM
               Jack, she's innocent!
    
                             JACK
               Sam - we've always been close,
               haven't we?
    
                              SAM
                    (eagerly)
               Yes we have, Jack!
    
                             JACK
               Well, could you stay away from me
               until this thing blows over.
    
    
117 EXT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL       NIGHT    117
                       BUILDING
    
    SAM is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval. The
    lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street
    lamps are lit. He is exhausted and depressed and anxious
    about the safety and whereabouts of Jill. He begins to
    retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry
    front steps and around the corner to where Jill's truck
    was parked.
    
    
117a       EXT.                              JUST AROUND THE
CORNER     NIGHT                             117a
    
    SAM stands in the passageway where JILL's lorry was first
    parked. The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is
    a small splodge of oil by the kerb. SAM stands lost and
    beaten under a street light. He slumps down to the
    pavement unsure his next move. The street light is
    reflected in the pool of oil. As he stares at the
    reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue
    cloud-filled sky. SAM turns to look at the actual street
    light. It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru
    the inner wall of the great stone ship.
    
    
117b       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY117b
    
                    DREAM GIRL'S VOICE
               I'm here Sam. Don't give up.
    
    SAM is pushing thru the GREY PRISONERS. The light from the
    crack shafts across the space in which they find
    themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall. There
    in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful,
    shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone
    cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards
    them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a
    great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a
    black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round
    he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the
    floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI
    WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT.
    The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he
    raises his spear in front of himself in an almost
    religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused.
    Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round
    just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic
    WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM
    parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then
    strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has
    vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears
    something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who
    is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down.
    Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards.
    He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the
    ground.
    
    Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes
    at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM
    spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM
    rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next
    to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again
    and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he
    can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with
    his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him
    to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the
    big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground
    before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the
    wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the
    situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground.
    The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages
    to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and
    opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries
    to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds
    in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes
    from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The
    wounds continue to bleed fire.
    
    SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen
    WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire
    rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing
    that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's
    his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire
    begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable.
    SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell
    tolls.
    
    
118 EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            NIGHT         118
    
    SAM's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. He is
    staring wide-eyed. A church bell tolls in the distance.
    SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's
    got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway
    but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows,
    is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses
    direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice
    comes from behind him.
    
                             JILL
               You're late.
    
    SAM spins around. Stepping out from the shadows is JILL -
    cigarette in her mouth.
    
                              SAM
                    (stunned)
               Jill! What are you do ... I mean ...
               how did you ... Are you alright?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                              SAM
               What happened to you after ...
    
                             JILL
               Your face ... are you hurt?
    
                              SAM
               No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick
               about you ... I thought ...
    
    A patrol car approaches. Quickly SAM grabs JILL and goes
    into a kiss to explain their presence. The car hesitates
    for a moment and drives on.
    
                             JILL
                    (through kiss)
               They're gone.
    
                              SAM
                    (through kiss)
               Are you sure?
    
                             JILL
                    (through kiss)
               Yes.
    
    They resume passionate kiss. After a moment
    
                              SAM
                    (urgently)
               C'mon, we've got to get you off the
               streets.
    
    They head off clutching one another.
    
    
119 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    NIGHT          119
    
    The Elysian Fields train arrives clattering. SAM and JILL
    are the only passengers to emerge. They can't keep their
    hands off one another. This is young love at its freshest
    and most exciting. SAM looks up and down the platform
    cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train
    clatters off again into the darkness. SAM and JILL
    approach SAM's front door. He puts a key in the door and
    tries to open the door but has some difficulty. Something
    creaks. He gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens
    and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head..
    
    
120 INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT         120
    
    SAM enters, followed by JILL. His breath immediately
    starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam. The
    flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then
    deep frozen. Icicles are hanging down from everywhere. The
    flat looks like a scrap dump. Every wall has spilled out
    its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of
    the available space and making progress through the flat
    difficult. Half a dozen MEN are at work. They are
    impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing
    and look more like spacemen. Their voices however belong
    to SPOOR and DOWSER.
    
                              SAM
               For God's sake, what's happened?
    
                             SPOOR
               Thermostat's gone. And then some.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... And then some.
    
                              SAM
               What have you done to my flat?
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign here, please.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... ere please.
    
    SPOOR offers a clipboard and pencil. He bangs the
    clipboard against the furniture to knock the ice off it.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             SPOOR
               It's a 27B/6 of course.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...B/6 of course.
    
                             JILL
                    (to Dowser)
               Do you repeat everying?
    
                            DOWSER
                    (nods)
               ... Everything.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (indicating the mess)
               This is what you get when you have
               cowboys round yer ducts.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... yer ducts.
    
                             SPOOR
               I think you've got your T41 crystal
               inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin-
               threaded-solenoid-control. It's
               either that or a new washer.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... new washer.
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign the form so we can get to it.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... get to it.
    
    SAM grabs the clipboard and smashes it over SPOOR's head.
    The board is so cold that it snaps in two. The paper on it
    also snaps in two.
    
    
121 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    NIGHT         121
    
    SAM pulls JILL out into the corridor.
    
                             JILL
               Don't you like parties?
    
                              SAM
               C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
    
    As SAM and JILL begin to move down the corridor they see a
    cigarette glow brightly in a dark recess.
    
                             JILL
                    (seeing cigarette light)
               TOO LATE!
    
    They ere about to run when TUTTLE steps out of the
    shadows.
    
                            TUTTLE
               I'll fix the damage when they've
               gone. I'll be ready for you tomorrow.
    
    
122 INT.   MOTHER'S CORRIDOR                 NIGHT         122
    
    A venerable PORTER carrying a single key on a large ring
    is preceding SAM and JILL along the corridor which we have
    seen before. The PORTER's name is MATTHEWS.
    
                              SAM
               My mother said it would be all right.
    
                           MATTHEWS
               She didn't say anything about it to
               me.
    
                              SAM
               Well, she's my mother, not yours.
    
                           MATTHEWS
               I won't be held responsible.
    
                              SAM
               How long will she he away?
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (darkly)
               There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's
               clinic who never come back at all.
    
    MATTHEWS unlocks MOTHER's door.
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (to Jill)
               You're not a professional, are you?
    
                             JILL
               No, amateur.
    
                              SAM
                    (firmly)
               Thank you, Matthews.
    
    With which he ushers JILL through the door and closes the
    door in MATTHEWS' face.
    
    
123 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          123
    
                              SAM
               Make yourself at home. Don't answer
               the phone or open he door to anyone.
               I won't be long.
    
                             JILL
               Where are you going?
    
                              SAM
               I'm going to pull some strings. It's
               our only hope.
    
                             JILL
               Don't do anything silly.
    
                              SAM
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.
    
                             JILL
               Take care.
    
    SAM goes.
    
    
124 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOYER       NIGHT          124
    
    SAM arrives at the Ministry of Information Retrieval
    reception It's late. GROUPS OF CLEANERS are operating
    cleaning machinery. SAM approaches the DESK PORTER who is
    playing with the executive toy SAM gave him.
    
                              SAM
               Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me
               through to Mr Helpmann's office?
    
                            PORTER
               I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to
               go through the proper channels.
    
                              SAM
               And you can't tell me what the proper
               channels are, because that's
               classified information?
    
                            PORTER
               I'm glad to see the Ministry's
               continuing its tradition of
               recruiting the brightest and best,
               sir.
    
                              SAM
               Thank you, Dawson.
    
    SAM crosses the foyer, checks to see that Dawson is no
    longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive
    toy, and slips past the lift which, at that moment,
    disgorges a leg-bandaged, be-crutched LIME who hobbles
    across the lobby without seeing SAM, who slips down the
    stairs which he knows lead to Helpmann's private lift.
    
    
125 INT.   BASEMENT                          NIGHT         125
    
    SAM creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding
    a GROUP OF SECURITY MEN who are singing carols in close
    harmony. ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction.
    They are all incredibly big and brutal looking.
    
                         CHOIR MASTER
                    (stopping them)
               No, no, no, Arthur, you're going flat
               on that G. It's your breathing. Take
               a breath on the end. of the previous
               line, after Noel. Right, one, two,
               three.
    
    The CHOIR begins singing again. SAM reaches the lift and
    looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall.
    CLOSE UP of SAM's face concentrating. He hears, we hear, a
    reprise of MR HELPMANN talking to SAM in MOTHER's
    bathroom.
    
                        HELPMANN (V/O)
               Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
               but we were close friends, and I keep
               his name alive at the office every
               day. It's as though he's there
               speaking to me. "'ere I am, J.H."
    
    SAM is already typing the letters EREIAMJH into the
    keyboard. The lift judders and star s to ascend.
    
    
126 INT.   MR HELPMANN'S OFFICE              NIGHT         126
    
    SAM steps out of lift into an ante-room. No-one is there.
    Tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the
    office. No reply. He slowly opens door.
    
    
                              SAM
               Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?
    
    The office is empty. SAM looks around - not sure what he
    wants to do. He notices his MOTHER's picture on HELPMANN's
    desk. He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by
    an elaborate computer console in a side room. It
    occasionally chatters away. Paper print-outs fill a large
    bin. Hesitantly SAM approaches it. Looking around to make
    sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the
    machine lights up.
    
    He cautiously pushes a couple more keys. The teleprinter
    machines have paused but one starts chattering now. He
    looks at the one which is busy. A CLOSE UP shows us the
    message coming through: TOTAL - TOTAL -TOTAL - CAR 15
    REQUEST FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE
    TROLLOPE - VAGRANT - DETAINED TERRORIST/SUSPECT/ASSOCIATE.
    This is followed by a code number. The teleprinter falls
    silent.
    
    SAM returns to the keyboard and switches it off. He turns
    to leave.
    The teleprinter starts chattering again. SAM stops and
    goes back to it and looks at the page again. A CLOSE UP
    shows us: UPDATE - SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED - CAUSE OF
    DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST. PLEASE DELETE FROM SPECIAL
    CATEGORY. The computer spool revolves back and forth for
    two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for
    a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches

127 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          127
    
    SAM enters the flat. JILL is nowhere to be seen. The
    lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door
    beams a shaft of bright light. Music pours forth ... it is
    "BRAZIL".
    
                              SAM
                    (cautiously)
               Jill?
    
    Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through.
    There is JILL but, transformed. She is wearing one of
    SAM's MOTHER's wigs which billows in the air blown by a
    fan. She is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed
    from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. She
    looks like the DREAM GIRL. SAM stands open-mouthed. JILL
    notices him and smiles.
    
                             JILL
               What do you think? ... is it me?
    
                              SAM
                    (still stunned)
               You don't exist any more. I've killed
               you. Jill Layton is dead.
    
    He holds out a print-out. She reads it and slowly looks
    up.
    
                             JILL
               Care for a bit of necrophilia?
    
    They rush together.
    
    
128 INT.   STONE SHIP                        ANTI-DAY      128
    
    The screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing
    about a beautiful blue sky. They course this way and that.
    Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a
    mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns.
    The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as
    SAM sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light.
    He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day.
    far below him the GREY PRISONERS gather beaming with
    happiness. Diving back to the ground - SAM unsheaths his
    sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of
    the great columns. The FORCES OF DARKNESS who have been
    lurking in the shadows slink back. SAM, with one mighty
    swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as
    cracks begin to race up and through the column. It is
    disintegrating. As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to
    topple. Everyone steps back. Down it plummets. And smashes
    into a million pieces. The bright blue sky escapes in all
    directions. The GREY PRISONERS' iron collars and chains
    fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a
    beautiful blue sky. They look up to the sun. SAM is
    exultant.
    
    
129 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  DAWN          129
    
    Pull back from the sun through a window. The light falls
    on SAM's smiling sleeping face. Showly he wakes. He little
    by little remembers where he is and reaches over for JILL.
    She isn't there. Sam panics.
    
                             JILL
               Merry Xmas.
    
    She is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him. She
    crawls over to him - they start to embrace.
    
                              SAM
               Everything is going to be all right.
    
    But crash !!! it's a raid! Like a giant drill a whirling
    cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of
    Mother's bedroom, and we now see what made the neat hole
    in the BUTTLE ceiling ... CUTS show doors being burst open
    by SECURITY TROOPS. JILL and SAM are frozen in panic.
    SECURITY TROOPS are sliding down a fireman's pole" from
    the hole in the ceiling.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouts)
               She's dead. Check the list!
    
    But it is SAM they have come for. He is being dragged out
    of the bed.
    
                            GUARDS
                    (as they struggle with him)
               You Turncoat Bastard! JUDAS!!
               TRAITOR!!
    
    A canvas bag is plunged over his head. All goes black.
    
                              SAM
                    (muffled)
               JILL!!!
    
    A shot rings out. JILL screams. It echoes through the
    blackness.
    
    
130 INT.   PROCESSING AREA                                 130
    
    In absolute inky darkness, SAM and the CAMERA move through
    space and time marked only by voices and sounds
    encountered on the way. This sound-sequence fades in and
    out a few times, indicating that the journey is longer
    than the real-time period of the blacked-out sequence. We
    hear:
    
    Footsteps of SAM and GUARDS.
    
    Distant howl of pain.
    
    Muzak.
    
    Iron gate.
    
    Footsteps again.
    
    Lift doors opening and closing.

               chemist for some antibiotics and
               bathroom scales and there's enough

    What looks like a rectangular hatch in the blackness
    opens. It is the eyeslit on the front of SAM's bag being
    opened by a SECURITY GUARD.
    
    The SECURITY GUARD peers in for a moment and then steps
    back to reveal two SMART OFFICIALS sitting at a desk. They
    are looking up at SAM/us.

               Right. Next!
    
    The SECURITY GUARD appears briefly and zips up the hood
    again plunging us back into darkness. We get more muffled
    shouts, heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere.
    
    Another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap on SAM's hood. We
    see another TWO OFFICIALS.
    
                              SAM
                    (more hysterical)
               Where's Jill? What's happened to
               Jill?
    
                          OFFICIAL C
               93/HKS/608, you've got quite a list
               of misdemeanours here, haven't you?
               All this is going to take time and
               money, and I'm afraid, according to
               your bank statement and credit rating
               here, you're likely to be in deep
               financial trouble by the end of it.
               Now, either you plead guilty to say,
               seven or eight of these charges,
               which'll bring the costs down to
               within your reach, or you can borrow
               a sum to be negotiated, from us, at
               very competitive rates. We can offer
               you something at say, eleven and a
               half per cent, over thirty years. But
               you will have to buy insurance to
               qualify for his scheme.
    
                          OFFICIAL D
               All you have to do is to agree to
               sign the appropriate boxes on these
               forms. Yes or no?
    
                              SAM
               I'm not guilty! Not guilty you stupid
               bastar...
    
    THE GUARD closes the flap. Once again darkness and
    confusion. until another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap
    again to reveal another TWO OFFICIALS.
    
                          OFFICIAL E
                    (examining forms)
               Now, since you've elected to plead
               not guilty on all these charges,
               you'd be well advised to take some
               sort of insurance cover. Preferably
               comprehensive, or if you'd prefer,
               something more specific - say,
               against electrical charges over
               f70.00. And for food and
               accommodation costs of say, £800.00.
               Detention can be a very expensive
               business.
    
                          OFFICIAL F
               Now, before we bore you with the
               small print perhaps you'd like to
               tell us whether you'd like to sign
               this insurance acceptance form or
               not. Think carefully before you
               decide. Thinking ahead in financial
               matters is always the wise course.
    
    The flap is closed and opened again very quickly - NEW
    OFFICIALS are revealed. This process repeats again and
    again - getting faster and faster. The OFFICIALS' faces
    seem to become a changing blur. Their voices overlap in a
    growing cacophony. The desk and the other items in the
    room remain static. To add to this disturbing effect the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS begin to gather in the room behind the
    OFFICIALS. As they increase in number they begin to press
    forward unseen by the OFFICIALS. Soon they fill the view
    through the flap.

    CUT to SAM struggling with the FORCES OF DARKNESS. He is
    overwhelmed by the black hordes. They fill the screen. SAM
    disappears under their onslaught. A pause. Then SAM is
    raised, spread-eagled, above the black sea of the FORCES.
    Strong hands hold him. The maniacal laughter starts up.
    SAM is turned in its direction.
    
    CUT to a shot over the top of the mass of robed FIGURES.
    Rising from the ruins of the stone columns, the black
    cloth thing flaps menacingly towards camera. We can see
    the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the Storeroom
    of Knowledge in the background.
    
    SAM looks terrified. As the thing hovers above SAM in all
    its huge twisting awfulness, it slowly begine to unfold
    like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion.
    
    SAM freezes as the interior becomes invisible. There in
    the billowing blackness is the GIRL. She is beckoning.
    
                             GIRL
               Sam.
    
    But the VOICE is no longer the mysterious feminine voice
    of before - it is the voice of the maniacal laughter.
    
    SAM struggles with the restraining hands. He twists and
    turns, but to no avail. From the darkness above him
    descends the JOLLY GENT looking just like MR HELPMANN) on
    his window washer's platform. However he is now dressed as
    Father Christmas.

    The filing cabinets of the Storeroom of Knowledge dissolve
    squares of padding that form the walls of a cell. The
    laughter echoes round the cell. SAM sees that MR HELPMANN,
    in his wheelchair is watching him. He is dressed as Father
    Christmas. They are alone in the cell. SAM scrunches up
    into the corner.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Sam, what are we going to do with

               you feel. So I brought you a bottle
               of barley water.

               I'm afraid she's upped stumps and
               retired to the pavilion.
    
                       SAM looks blank.

               Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it

               arrest.
    
                              SAM
                    (relieved)
               No, no ... I did that...
    
    HELPMANN looks surprised. SAM shuts up.
    
                           HELPMANN
               The odd thing is it appears to have
               happened twice ... a bit of a
               disputed call, I'm afraid.
    
    SAM has gone catatonic.
    
                           HELPMANN
                    (starting to go)
               So, there you are. All I can say is,
               don't fall at the last fence. The
               finishing post's in sight. See you in
               the paddock. Good luck. Keep your eye
               on the ball. Got to go .... Can't
               keep the orphans waiting.
    
    HELPMANN goes. A GUARD helps him out and then returns with
    ANOTHER to help put the restraining bag over SAM.
    
                             GUARD
               Don't fight it, son .... confess
               quickly ... Before they get into the
               expensive procedures. If you hold out
               too long you could jeopardise your
               credit rating.
    
    The bag blacks everything out.
    
    
133 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM                      133
    
    The bag comes off. SAM finds himself strapped into an
    Information Retrieval chair. The CAMERA tracks back
    frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an
    unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of
    sight.
    
    The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange
    light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total
    disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately
    trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain
    tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments.
    Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at
    hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions
    near the distant door they hand over documents to the
    white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.
    
                             GUARD
               11/AFT/607, sir.
    
    They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains
    after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then
    proceed to the door and take up positions on either side
    of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see
    he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS.
    A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching
    him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the
    I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway.
    After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the
    impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the
    GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep
    breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more
    briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and
    fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is
    covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he
    blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto
    the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.
    
                              SAM
               Jack?
    
    The I.R. OFFICER reacts to this as if he's been hit in the
    solar plexus, and he tries to disguise it by simulating a
    coughing fit. He then picks up a nasty looking implement
    and advances on SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Jack?... Jack?
    
                             JACK
                    (hysterically from behind
                    mask)
               Shut up!
    
                              SAM
               Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
    
                             JACK
               Bastard!!!
    
                              SAM
               This is all a mistake. Jack, please
               take that mask off.
    
    JACK is very close to SAM, he is shaking. He lifts up his
    mask to reveal sweaty face, contorted with fear and anger.
    
                             JACK
               You stupid bastard!
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             JACK
               How could you do this to me?
    
                              SAM
               Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
    
                             JACK
               How do you think I feel? You shit!
    
                              SAM
               Jack ...
    
                             JACK
                    (pulling down mask)
               Shut up! This is a professional
               relationship!
    
    JACK comes at SAM with the horrifying implement.
    
                              SAM
               JACK!! ... You can't ... No, don't!
    
    SAM's eyes widen in terror. From his POV we look up at
    JACK approaching. The ceiling above and behind JACK is
    suddenly and. loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole
    Machine, and in an instant without benefit of "fireman's
    pole", the commando-like figure of MR TUTTLE gun in hand,
    leaps through the hole.
    TUTTLE is immediately followed by similar looking MEN with
    balaclavas, guerilla-type clothing, and very efficient
    guns. JACK is cut down. So are the TWO GUARDS who have
    opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into
    the room.
    
    TUTTLE raps out into a walkie-talkie
    
                            TUTTLE
               Detonate!
    
    From somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion
    which rocks the room. TUTTLE is already unstrapping SAM.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Let's go!
    
    
134 INT.   CORRIDORS                         NIGHT         134
    
    CUT to RESCUERS, with SAM in the middle, fighting their
    way in the terrific battle with GUARDS, until they get to
    a door leading to the stairs.
    
    
135 INT.   ENDLESS STAIRWAYS                 NIGHT         135
    
    CUT to RESCUERS, their members thinning, and SAM, fighting
    down flight after flight of stairs with lots of neat-oh
    violence and blood and, gunshots and ... falling and
    bleeding and -
    
    
136 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY       NIGHT          136
    
    CUT to the RESCUERS fighting their way to the entrance.
    Another group of RESCUERS at the door are providing cover
    fire The PORTER sits behind his desk watching the battle
    on his bank of monitors.
    
                           2ND GROUP
    
               Quick! We've only got thirty seconds
               to get clear!
    
    TUTTLE tosses SAM a dark overcoat to cover his light grey
    detainee outfit. Together, the TWO GROUPS burst out
    through the door into the large empty forecourt.
    
    
137 EXT.   FORECOURT                         NIGHT          137
    
    The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights.
    Machine gun installations open fire. The RESCUERS are
    totally exposed.
    
    They are cut down left and right.
    Desperately they battle their way across the open space.
    Time running out. SAM, knowing the way, leads TUTTLE
    towards a shielded spot. Will they make it? As the last
    RESCUER is cut down SAM and TUTTLE dive for cover.
    KOWBLAMMPOW! A massive explosion. Then another. And
    another. SECURITY TROOPS caught unprotected are decimated.
    SAM looks up. Christ! The building is being blown to bits.
    Certain windows are lit. They spell out MERRY XMAS. With a
    final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser
    of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of T.V. consoles and
    visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, MR
    HELPMANN's masterpiece. But also tons and tons of paper.
    
    Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected
    its load skywards. The night sky is full of white
    rectangular wisps. Ashlike they flutter down over the
    city. SAM looks around and can't see TUTTLE anywhere. He
    shouts for him. But the remaining TROOPS have spotted SAM
    and SAM runs.
    
    
138 EXT.   CITY PASSAGES                     NIGHT         138
    
    SAM runs madly through paper-littered passages
    
    
139 EXT.   SHOPPING                          PRECINCT     NIGHT139
    
    Eluding his pursuers, SAM dives into a crowded, garishly
    lit, shopping centre. Once among the protective company of
    he mindlessly shopping MOB, SAM slows down and proceeds
    casually. The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business
    paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them.
    Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way
    towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking
    against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds
    across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his
    foot. He tries shaking it off.
    
    It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the
    piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other
    leg. He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the
    flying debris. Another hits him and twists around his arm.
    Still more paper blows against him. He is having
    difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he
    tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him.
    He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe
    what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business,
    apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from
    ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley -
    and watches it career down the steps of the shopping
    precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon
    of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about
    on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from
    his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE.
    The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind
    carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile.
    But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few
    pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there
    with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he
    is suddenly very visible. All the shopping bustle has
    stopped. They are all staring at him. SAM spots TROOPS
    shouldering their way towards him. He turns tail and
    dashes off.
    
    
140 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT         140
    
    The drawing room door burst open as SAM dashes in. SAM
    goes straight through and into the bedroom. The room is
    empty of all terrestrial human life forms. A hollow wind
    blows the curtains.
    
    
141 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  NIGHT         141
    
    The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling).
    SAM turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway. He rushes
    forwards.
    
    
142 INT. MOTHER'S FRONT DOOR NIGHT 142
    
    But it's MATTHEWS the porter who is at the door watching
    SAM running towards him.
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (piously)
               A sad loss. Your mother was with her
               at the end. The doctor said there was
               no pain.
    
    SAM grabs MATTHEWS round the neck and shakes him.
    
                              SAM
               Where is she?
    
    
143 EXT    A CORNER                          NIGHT         143
    
    SAM comes running around corner. He is suddenly bathed in
    a strange blue light. He halts and looks up. There
    opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance
    to a chapel of dully modernistic design. Holy music from
    an electric organ can be heard. SAM rushes up the stops
    and through the door.
    
    
144 INT. CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER NIGHT 144
    
    CUT to SAM slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and
    suddenly being confronted by SPIRO the Maitre D.
    
                             SPIRO
               Ah, yes, Mr Lowry. It's so good you
               could make it. Right this way.
    
    SAM, dumbfounded, follows.
    
    CUT to SAM being lead into the middle of the cold, modern
    chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted
    up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit
    theatrical. A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some
    sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a VICAR stands
    in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in
    stepped seats on three sides of the room.
    
    The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped
    the lid. Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large,
    rather idealized, colour portrait of MRS TERRAIN looking
    not so much young as beautiful. Among the MOURNERS are DRS
    JAFFE and CHAPMAN and others in their operating gowns.
    
    
    To enlarge on the scene, we see SHIRLEY T snuffling in her
    hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the
    VICAR standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it,
    etc. CUT to SAM trying to take all this in, stopping in
    the middle of the room. Don't forget DR CHAPMAN sobbing.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (stopping and looking back
                    at Sam)
               Mrs Lowry? Mrs Lowry is ...
    
    In the background the VICAR begins speaking, and we hear
    his voice throughout the following action. CUT TO SAM'S
    POV ....
    
                     VICAR (in background)
               At these times of giving and
               receiving let's remember the greatest
               gift of all: not a gift to be
               spurned, not a gift to be opened and
               carelessly set on one side, not a
               gift to be taken back and changed,
               but the gift of eternal life. Mrs
               Terrain has just received that most
               wonderful of all gifts. She came to
               us physically new, she goes hence
               from us not so physically new. But
               the spirit never grows old. And in
               the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs
               Terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy
               forever.
    
    ..... (CUT to SAM's POV) ... past SPIRO to a section in
    the bleachers directly across from the coffin and the
    VICAR where a WOMAN (her back to SAM) is surrounded by a
    buzzing flock of very handsome and well-dressed YOUNG MEN.
    
                              SAM
                    (trying to take in scene)
               what? ... Oh ...
                    (starts to follow Spiro)
    
                             SPIRO
                    (coming up to back of
                    woman)
               Madam ...
    CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It
    is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years
    younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sam!!!
                    (uncertainty in her
                    expression)
    
                              SAM
                    (staring dumbly, not
                    knowing what to say)
               Mother? ... What ... what's ...
               you've got to help me ...
    
                            MOTHER
                    (embarrassed, unsure)
               Not now ... please
    
                         YOUNG GALLANT
                    (belligerently)
               Ida, is this fellow bothering you?
                    (getting up)
               I'll -
    
    But before we can find out what he'll:
    
                             SFX:
               TERRIFIC CRASH.
    
    CUT to entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come
    crashing in. PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The
    TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads
    for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes
    against the coffin which topples over spilling its
    contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his
    mouth and dashes through the door.
    
    
145 EXT.   MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES           NIGHT          145
    
    CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things,
    hurting himself, getting up running.
    He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path
    seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams.
    The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes
    deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top
    shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing
    FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The
    maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and
    right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.
    Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there
    is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead
    end.
    At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from
    the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair
    dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through
    this pile.
    
    
    Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He
    scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS,
    TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape.
    He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He
    actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to
    face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand
    touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The
    knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through
    it.
    
    
146 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT         146
    
    SAM finds himself in a strange little house empty of
    furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed
    frame. He tries to lock the door behind him but there is
    no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it
    shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit
    but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet
    uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully.
    He looks around but there is only one window and it is
    shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-
    
    SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.
    
    
147 EXT.   CITY                              NIGHT         147
    
    JILL's truck, with the house on its back, is driving
    dangerously through he streets. It lurches round the
    corner.
    
    
148 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT          148
    
    - The lurch throws SAM to one side. He picks himself up,
    and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the
    shuttered window which is at the front end of the house,
    in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and
    finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He
    sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing
    JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs
    on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so
    that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He
    sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him.
    SAM sobs with relief and love.
    
    
149 EXT.   THE ROAD                          NIGHT         149
    
    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches then breasts
    the rise beyond which lies ... looking more than ever ...
    JILL'S VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a MIX ...
    
    
150 INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  NIGHT         150
    
    Through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead.
    The reverse shot shows us JILL driving and SAM next to
    her. They glance at each other.
    
    
151 EXT.   SMALL ROAD                        EARLY MORNING 151
    
    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches and then
    breasts the rise beyond which lies ... A STUNNINGLY
    BEAUTIFUL UNTOUCHED VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a
    MIX ...
    
    
152 EXT.   BEAUTIFUL VALLEY                  DAY           152
    
    Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with
    the house on its back. Creepers and wild roses have grown
    up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke
    rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to
    one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck
    has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a
    vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some
    chickens. JILL appears locking like CRUSOE carrying a
    basket of eggs.
    
    
153 INT.   HOUSE                             MORNING       153
    
    SAM is in the bed, just waking up. He opens his eyes,
    locking calm. Off screen we hear the door opening.
    
                       JILL (off screen)
               Morning. Sleep well?
    
    SAM nods his head slightly, on the pillow.
    
                              SAM
                    (quietly)
               I don't dream anymore.
                    (he embraces her)
    
    
154 EXT.   HOUSE AND GARDEN                  MORNING       154
    
    A high shot. Everything in the garden is definitely
    lovely. The music tells us. The music swells and the
    camera slowly pulls back, and back. It's a happy ending.
    And then, in the foreground, TWO HUGE HEADS appear looking
    straight at the camera. It is MR HELPMANN and JACK. They
    both shake their heads.
    
                          MR HELPMANN
               He's got away from us, Jack.
    
    CUT to their POV.
    
155 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM        DAY            155
    
    Sam is sitting in the IR chair. He is strapped in. His
    eyes are open but miles away. His face is wreathed in a
    benign and very happy smile.
    
                             JACK
               I'm afraid you're right, Mr.
               Helpmann. He's gone.
    
    A wide shot of the room shows us HELPMANN and LINT turn
    away and leave. SAM is left alone. He is humming.. The
    camera pulls back and back. The Information Retrieval room
    with SAM in it floats away into the most beautiful
    glorious sky ever.
    
    SAM's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ......
    
    
               "Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June,
               We stood beneath an amber moon,
               And softly murmured 'Some day soon'
               We kissed and clung together,
               Then, tomorrow was another day.
               The morning found me miles away,
               With still a million things to say,
               Now, when twilight beams the sky above,
               Recalling thrills of our love,
               There's one thing I'm certain of,
               Return, I will,
               To old Brazil."

    THE END

1   EXT.   CITYSCAPE                         SUNSET           1

    A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The
    CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises
    into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the
    frame. The building is neither past nor future in design
    but a bit of both.
    
    Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads
    below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated
    transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely
    huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule
    relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level
    awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent
    tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an
    elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of
    large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,
    the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs
    take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper
    levels of a plush shopping precinct.

2   INT.   SHOPPING PRECINT                  NIGHT            2
    
    Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,
    ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on
    display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly
    packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of
    elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one
    window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the
    screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister
    of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to
    listen to HELPMANN.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Deputy minister, what do you believe
               is behind this recent increase in
               terrorist bombings?

                           HELPMANN
               Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless
               minority of people seems to have
               forgotten certain good old fashioned
               virtues. They just can't stand seeing
               the other fellow win. If these people
               would just play the game, instead of
               standing on the touch line heckling -

                          INTERVIEWER
               In fact, killing people -

                           HELPMANN
               - In fact, killing people - they'd
               get a lot more out of life.

    We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers.
    HELPMANN's voice carries over the rest of the scene.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to
               those critics who maintain that the
               Ministry Of Information has become
               too large and unwieldy ...?

                           HELPMANN
               David ... in a free society
               information is the name of the game.
               You can't win the game if you're a
               man short.

    Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be
    banks of snow but as we pan along with them the "snow"
    turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop
    front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames.
    WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood
    sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are
    being played by a Salvation Army style band calling
    themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is
    busy, all is well with the world.

                          INTERVIEWER
               And the cost of it all, Deputy
               Minister? Seven percent of the gross
               national produce ...

                           HELPMANN
               I understand this concern on behalf
               of the tax-payers. People want value
               for money and a cost-effective
               service.

3   INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT            3

    CUT TO TV screen with HELPMANN still talking.

                           HELPMANN
               That is why we always insist on the
               principle of Information Retrieval
               Charges. These terrorists are not
               pulling their weight, and it's
               absolutely right and fair that those
               found guilty should pay for their
               periods of detention and the
               Information Retrieval Procedures used
               in their interrogation.

    PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests
    on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-
    tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He
    comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to
    discover a shiny, metal "executive toy".

    CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.

    The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as
    it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some
    paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.

Scenes 4-12 Deleted.                              4-12 Deleted.

13  INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT           13
    
    The TECHNICIAN gets up and balances a chair on top of his
    desk. He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE
    still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath
    him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away
    compiling a typed list of names under the heading
    "Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention &
    Interview". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper
    which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic
    guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate
    sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet
    following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE-
    UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in
    the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F.
    ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ... TURNER,
    John D. ... Every name begins with T.

                          INTERVIEWER
               Do you think that the government is
               winning the battle against
               terrorists?

                           HELPMANN
               On yes. Our morale is much higher
               than theirs, we're fielding all their
               strokes, running a lot of them out,
               and pretty consistently knocking them
               for six. I'd say they're nearly out
               of the game.
               
    The TECHNICIAN is tottering on one leg on the chair on the
    desk as he strains to swat the BEETLE. Swish, swash, oops,
    WHAP! Gottcha!!

                          INTERVIEWER
               But the bombing campaign is now in
               its thirteenth year ...

                           HELPMANN
               Beginner's luck.

    The BEETLE's career comes to a halt ... squashed flat on
    the brilliantly clean ceiling ... or has it? As the
    TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the
    BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops
    silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs,
    hesitates and then types the letter "B" and hesitates and
    then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.

    The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine
    continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ... TUZCZLOW,
    Peter...

                          INTERVIEWER
               Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

                           HELPMANN
               Thank you, David ... and a very merry
               Christmas to you all.

14  EXT.   HOUSING TOWERS                    NIGHT           14
    
    ZOOMING past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we
    TIGHTEN in on one of several massive residential tower
    blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of
    the city

15  INT.   BUTTLE FLAT                       NIGHT           15
    
    HELPMANN and INTERVIEWER are on the TV, the end credits
    rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune.
    PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional
    sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out
    the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that
    snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. Smaller
    conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various
    services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the
    metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but
    proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading
    Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six.
    BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some
    action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting
    the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present
    which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just
    seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.

    Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of
    the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the
    floor above.

16  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           16

    The flat is very bare and basic. The laughter is coming
    from a cheap portable television showing "Sgt. Bilko. From
    BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom
    straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the
    person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath
    is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she
    watches Bilko in the mirror. From her POV in the mirror,
    the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body
    of a MAN in uniform.

                             JILL
                    (scared)
               Who's there?

17  INT.   BUTTLE'S FLAT                     NIGHT           17
    
    The BUTTLE FAMILY as before. MRS BUTTLE is closing the
    book.

                          MRS BUTTLE
               There, that's enough for tonight. He
               won't come Xmas Eve if you don't get
               plenty of sleep.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Father Christmas can't come if we
               haven't got a chimney.

                          MRS BUTTLE
               You'll see.

    The GIRL exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and
    leaves the room.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
               How will he get down from upstairs?

                          BOY BUTTLE
               It's a secret.

    We follow GIRL BUTTLE out of the sitting room into ...

18  INT.   HALLWAY AND CHILDREN'S BEDROOM    NIGHT           18

    GIRL BUTTLE enters her bedroom. There is little or no
    light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently
    lowering himself into the room from the direction of the
    ceiling.

                          GIRL BUTTLE
                    (unalarmed)
               You've come ...

    As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the
    figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid,
    slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. The
    pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the
    ceiling. Things become immediately clearer

19  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM               NIGHT           19

    Crash! It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash
    trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in
    the window from the outside and enters that way. Most
    alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the
    ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and
    through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide
    TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal
    and violent.
    
    BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike
    canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal
    clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back
    of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In
    seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL
    BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into
    the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy
    machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we
    see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has
    been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are
    viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the
    doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An
    OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front
    door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an
    official document. It goes something like this:

                           OFFICIAL
               I hereby inform you under powers
               entrusted to me under Section 47,
               Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number
               438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald,
               residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri
               La Towers, has been invited to assist
               the Ministry of Information with
               certain enquiries, the nature of
               which may be ascertained on
               completion of application form
               BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this
               date, and that he is liable to

               Council Order 173497, including
               financial restitutions which may or
               may not be incurred if Information
               Retrieval procedures beyond those
               incorporated in Article 7 subsections
               8, 10 & 32 are required to elicit
               information leading to permanent
               arrest - notification of which will
               he served with the time period of 5
               working days as stipulated by law. In
               that instance the detainee will be
               debited without further notice
               through central banking procedures
               without prejudice until and unless at

               or third parties on completion of a
               re-imbursement form RB/CZ/907/X ...

    ... and more of the same, most of which is part of the
    audible wall paper while the chaos reigns. As the front
    door slams behind the captive relative peace returns,
    broken by MRS BUTTLE's anguished sobbing.

                    (tearing out sheet from
                    pink book)
               That's your receipt for your husband.
                    (taking blue book from her)
               Thank you. And this is my receipt for
               your receipt.
                    (he turns to leave along
                    with troopers)

    JILL's shocked face appears looking down through the hole
    in the ceiling. The faces of the workmen BILL and CHARLIE
    also appear, above and behind her.

                             JILL
               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?

    The helmeted SECURITY TROOPS in Buttle's flat drop to
    defensive positions and swing their machine guns up
    towards the hole in the ceiling. All three faces retreat.
    
    
20  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           20
    
                            CHARLIE
                    (starting back from the
                    hole with Bill and Jill)
               Eh! Eh! Eh! We're Department of
               Works! Department of Works up here!
               Careful with those bloody things!
    
    JILL, CHARLIE and BILL are hustled aside by a SECURITY MAN
    who clears the fireman's pole from the hole. We can see
    the TROOPS in the room below leaving. A SECOND SECURITY
    man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window. He
    coils the rope up neatly and the TWO SECURITY MEN leave
    the flat.
    
                             BILL
                    (to Jill as they watch this
                    highly efficient operation)
               Don't take any notice, love, it's
               their training makes them like
               animals. Best in the world, though.
    
                             JILL
               Who are you?
    
                            CHARLIE
               Don't you worry love, we'll have
               everything shipshape in a jiffy.
    
                             BILL
               That's it. Nothing to worry about.
    
                            CHARLIE
               It's Buttle downstairs who can worry,
               eh?
    
                             JILL
               There must be some mistake ... Mr
               Buttle's harmless...
    
                             BILL
               We don't make mistakes.
    
    So saying, he drops the manhole cover, which is faced with
    same material as the floor, over the hole in the floor. To
    his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the
    flat below.
                            CHARLIE
               Bloody typical, they've gone back to
               metric without telling us
               

20a INT.   BUTTLES' FLAT                     NIGHT          20a
    
    MRS BUTTLE stands stunned in the middle of her decimated
    flat. The KIDS wail. Slowly MRS BUTTLE collapses -
    slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we
    tighten into CLOSE UP of "Receipt".

                       JILL (off CAMERA)
               Mrs Buttle? Mrs Buttle?

21  INT.   RECORD CLERK'S POOL                               21
    
    We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT
    being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to
    reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal
    desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each
    (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed
    under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in
    the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk
    intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS
    bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of
    the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,
    tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is
    supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN.
    Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and
    walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top
    of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.

    MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it
    behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each
    CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch,
    and all the screens change to something which looks very
    like "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly".

22  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             22
    
    MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his
    desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the
    console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number
    of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE
    say, "Turn around real slow, amigo". MR KURTZMAN turns
    around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his
    T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently
    flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which
    we see as marked "Buttle, Archibald". He opens the file
    and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V.
    starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled.
    He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash
    "Error, error, error". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration.
    He presses an intercom.
                          MR KURTZMAN
                    (into intercom)
               Mr Lowry, will you step in here
               please?
               
    He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody
    comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over
    to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of
    CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and
    whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in
    the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.

                          MR KURTZMAN
               Does anyone know where Lowry is?

    Nobody knows. MR KURTZMAN closes his door again. A moment
    later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the
    crash of six guns blazing away at each other. He re-opens
    the door. The only sound again. He goes back to his desk.
    He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even
    more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "Admit
    you're whupped, you drygulching scum". KURTZMAN explodes
    with anger, and presses the intercom again.

                          MR KURTZMAN
                    (Shouting into intercom)
               Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!

23  EXT.   SKY                               DAY             23
    
    CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird-
    like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer
    we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood
    and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their
    flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect.
    Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an
    outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI
    fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then,
    banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice
    can be heard calling "Sam ... Sam ... Sam". He hovers,
    looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO
    face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised
    twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her
    face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly
    mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft
    billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises
    and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA
    GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that
    the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast
    landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the
    sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial
    ballet.
    
    Romantic music fills the soundtrack.
    
    SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as
    SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM
    begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy
    quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening
    rumble. SAM looks down.
    
    The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive,
    monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and
    soars upwards with a mighty rush.
    
    CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into
    FRAME partially cutting her off from view.
    
    Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper
    breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another
    and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is
    being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless
    structures. And then she is finally lost from view
    somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis.
    SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid.
    No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with
    their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among
    these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only
    sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls
    plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound
    but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in
    this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something
    in the distance. far below him a dark procession is
    wending its way through the narrow passages... away from
    him.
    
    CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way
    past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister
    figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several
    heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal
    cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the
    cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside
    is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as
    if there were a breeze in constant attendance.
    
    CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.
    
    CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their
    tracks. They've seen something.
    
    CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between
    two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.
    
    CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back.
    Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces
    are the same except for the manner in which they have
    decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly
    the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become
    long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others
    shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The
    FORCES are massed ready to charge.
    CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his
    wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.
    
    Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the
    constant dribble from their cracked mouths.

    CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable.
    Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the
    fearsome horde. Unarmed!

    CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing
    madly.

    SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading
    field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time
    catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries
    a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack!
    Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this
    boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing
    of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way
    through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly,
    they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate
    SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way
    toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise
    behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of
    black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of
    flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces
    and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition
    emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM
    is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is
    stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks
    around - confused.

24  INT.   SAM'S BEDROOM                     MORNING         24

    TIGHT SHOT of telephone. The ringing continues. A hand
    grapples with the receiver. SAM is in bed in a darkened
    room. Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.

                              SAM
               Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr
               Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is
               it?

    There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,
    incorporating an alarm. SAM thumps it. The alarm goes off.
    This sets of a series of other things ... The window
    shutters roll up letting in the morning light. Both taps
    turn on in the bathroom ...

                              SAM
                    (into phone)
               The electronics here are up the
               spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry
               sir - I'll be there.

    SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is
    moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is
    loose he pushes the pin in firmly.
    
    In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting
    room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a
    cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with
    SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM
    comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath
    taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee-
    maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours
    a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this
    we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is
    functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been
    assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are
    built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal
    panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall
    panels have Central Services logos on them with the
    admonition "Do not obstruct or remove" below. SAM has
    livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film
    posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures
    of wide beautiful vistas.

25  INT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION LOBBY     DAY             25

    This is a gigantic, vaguely 30's monumental-style
    building. The lobby is a vast impressive space containing
    reception desks, fountains, statues etc. Prominent are the
    security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras,
    video screens and groups of SECURITY MEN who search all
    who enter. SAM is finishing going through Security when he
    meets JACK who is on his way out of the building.

                             JACK
               Sam!

                              SAM
               Jack!

                             JACK
               Long time no see!

                              SAM
               Well, since you disappeared up the
               ladder of Information Retrieval ... I
               don't expect to see you slumming in
               Records - what's the problem?

                             JACK
               Problem? - No problem - yes,
               everything's going fantastically
               well, wonderful, marvelous, great
               career prospects, Alison in great
               shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm
               on Security Level Five now, and Mr
               Helpmann relies on me more and more,
               yes, couldn't be better, I feel
               terrifically motivated and job-
               rewarded -
               
                              SAM
               You sound worried.

                             JACK
               Me? - if I'm worried about anyone,
               it's you. What happened to you, Sam?
               You were the brightest of us -

    As they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit
    TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering
    the lobby. As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on
    their faces for a frozen CLOSE-UP. JILL has just entered
    and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face. SAM
    happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the
    over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE
    DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being
    replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where
    the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as
    she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so
    there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM
    GIRL. SAM decides he must have imagined it. Over this JACK
    has been talking.

                             JACK
               What's the matter?
                               
                              SAM
               Sorry. Nothing.
                    (snapping out of it)
               See you - I'm going to be late.

                             JACK
                    (looking at his watch)
               You are late.

                              SAM
               Even later.

                             JACK
               Sam, your life is going wrong - let
               your friends tell you - Records is a
               dead end department, no Security
               Level worth a damn, it's impossible
               to get noticed -

                              SAM
               Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous,
               wonderful - remember me to Alison -
               and the - er - twins.

                             JACK
               Triplets.
    
                              SAM
               Really? - God, how time flies!
    
    As SAM heads off to the lift, he passes a group of MEN
    standing around a temporary TV monitor. Several of them
    are dressed in white lab coats. They are being explained
    the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman
    type. His assistant is operating the controls. On the
    monitor we can see JILL standing in the queue for the
    Information desk. The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on
    her.
    
    CUT TO JILL at top of queue with several forms in her
    hand. A strange prototype radio controlled camera on a
    wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches
    her. Throughout the next sequence it pokes around JILL in
    an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying
    to see what is written on the forms, peering over her
    shoulder. JILL hands a form to the Information Porter.
    
                             JILL
               I want to report a wrongful arrest.
    
                            PORTER
                    (looking at form)
               You want Information Adjustments.
               Different department.
    
                             JILL
                    (exasperated but
                    controlled)
               I've been to Information Adjustments.
               They sent me here. They told me you
               had a form I had to fill in.
    
                            PORTER
               Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                            PORTER
               Is it stamped?
    
                             JILL
                    (producing Buttle receipt)
               Stamped?
    
                            PORTER
                    (examining receipt)
               No, there's no stamp on it. You see!
               I can't give you the form until it's
               stamped.
    
                             JILL
               Where do I get it stamped?

               Information Adjustments.
    
    The radio-controlled camera noses right up to JILL's face
    as she turns. She swats the annoying thing with her stack
    of forms as she storms off. The camera overbalances and
    crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.
    
    CUTTING BACK to the GROUP around the monitor we see a
    deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-coated
    TECHNICIANS.
    
    
26  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             26
    
    SAM is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem
    while KURTZMAN looks on anxiously and ineffectually.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Perhaps the machine's on the blink!
               It keeps picking up old films. That
               can't he right, can it?
    
                              SAM
               It's not the machine. There's a
               mismatch on the personnel code
               numbers... Ah there we go! That's a
               B58/732 when it should be a T47/215
               ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06,
               debited against his account for
               electrical procedures, not Buttle.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh my God, a mistake!
    
                              SAM
               It's not our mistake!
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (eagerly)
               Isn't it? Whose is it?
    
                              SAM
               Information Retrieval.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh, good!
    
                              SAM
               Expediting has put in for electrical
               procedures in respect of Buttle,
               Archibald, shoe repair operative, but
               Security has invoiced Admin for
               Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
    
    SAM is still punching keys.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What a relief! I don't know what I'd
               do if you ever got promoted.
    
                              SAM
               Don't worry.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               But if they did promote you
    
                              SAM
               I've told you before. I'd turn it
               down.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Would you really, Sam?
    
                              SAM
               Really.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (churned up)
               You've been promoted.
    
    KURTZMAN hands SAM a sheet of printed paper. SAM takes the
    paper, not pleased, and glances at it.
    
    CLOSE UP of paper: "LOWRY, S. (RECORDS. MIN OF INF.)
    TRANSFER TO INFORMATION RETRIEVAL - (Expediting, Security
    Level 3).
    
                           KURTZMAN
               It's your mother isn't it? Pulling
               strings again.
    
                              SAM
                    (explodes)
               What a BITCH!
    
    
27  INT.   DOCTOR'S OFFICE                   DAY             27
    
    CUT TO an old WOMAN's face reflected in triplicate in a
    three-panelled mirror. A pair of MAN's hands have a grip
    on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on
    either side of her face. When I say several inches that's
    just what I mean. Not only are her jowls being stretched
    like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to
    the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth
    her face can be made by DOCTOR who is prattling on over
    this freak show.
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs
               Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here
               ... and there ...
    
    CUT TO WIDE SHOT of DOCTOR's surgery. It looks a bit like
    a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. The
    cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised
    with pastel coloured chintz and satin. At the dressing
    table sits the old WOMAN, SAM'S MOTHER. Behind her stands
    the DOCTOR. He is much like his surgery. He has tailored
    his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. It
    seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself.
    There is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all
    in all he has been fairly successful. SAM is pacing
    around, raving.
    
                              SAM
                    (angrily)
               I just wish you would stop
               interfering, mother! I don't want
               promotion. I'm happy where I am.
    
                            MOTHER
               No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson
               to you - he never had your brains but
               he's got the ambition. You haven't
               got the ambition but luckily you've
               got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann
               was very close -
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now, Mrs Lowry, don't get upset
                    (so SAM)
               Please wait in reception, Mr Lowry,
               you're giving her wrinkles.
    
                            MOTHER
               You see!
    
                              SAM
                    (groans)
    
                            DOCTOR
               Now Mrs Lowry, try to relax. You must
               trust me. I'll make you twenty years
               younger ...
                               
                              SAM
               Huh!
                               
                            DOCTOR
                    (giving Sam a dirty look)
               ... twenty-five if we just drain the
               excess fluid from the pouches ...
    
                            MOTHER
               Dr Jaffe, you're a genius. Would you
               like to be Surgeon General? Four
               Star. I know everybody.
                               
                            DOCTOR
               Well they won't know you when I've
               finished with you.
               
    The DOCTOR reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured
    marker. He starts colouring up her face with strokes of
    different coloured markers.
    
                            DOCTOR
               First we must eliminate the excess
               derma ... so! ... Then the flaccid
               tissues under the eyes ... And now
               the forehead ... Zip! I lift the
               wrinkles and worry lines right up
               into the wi- into the hairline, comme
               ca ...
    
    SAM looks disgusted.
    
                            DOCTOR
               And now the template ... There ...
               there ... there ... Now a bit of
               sticky ... There we go!
                    (triumphantly)
               Already she is twice as beautiful as
               she was before - voila!
    
    The DOCTOR moves his body aside, revealing MRS LOWRY's
    face, covered with coloured lines and wrapped in
    cellophane held in shape by cellotape. SAM stares at her.
    
                              SAM
               My God, it works.
    
    
28  INT.   POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE)        DAY             28
    
    The conversation between SAM and his MOTHER takes place
    while they are going through the sort of security checks
    familiar at airports. They are, however, just outside the
    velvet rope of the posh restaurant.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (in full flow)
               Mr Helpmann was very close to your
               poor father. He was very close to me.
               Still is. He'll take you under his
               wing at Information Retrieval. You'll
               like it when you get there.
    
                              SAM
               You're not listening, mother.
    
    A warning buzzer goes off as MOTHER's handbag goes thru
    security check. It turns out to have been activated by a
    gaily wrapped package. A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it
    and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of
    executive toy which we have seen twice before.
    
                            MOTHER
               It's a present for my son.
    
    She takes the toy back and hands it to SAM.
    
                            MOTHER
               I hope you like it. It's very
               exclusive.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                            MOTHER
               It's something for executives.
    
    At this point the MAITRE D arrives on the scene.
    
                           MAITRE D
               Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you
               again. Merry Christmas.
    
    He pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. He
    looks disdainfully at SAM's unfashionable clerk's suite
    
                            MOTHER
               Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (blocking Sam's way)
               I'm sorry but ...
    
                            MOTHER
               You remember Samuel, my son.
    
                             SPIRO
                    {suddenly unctious)
               Oh, but of course ...
    
                            MOTHER
               We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
    
                              SAM
               Are we?
    
                             SPIRO
               Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
    
    SPIRO leads the way. SAM and his MOTHER follow, across the
    restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza
    New York. Trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring,
    potted palms combine to impress us with their
    sophistication and taste. A string quartet can just be
    made out against the far wall. Except for the unfortunate
    intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting
    across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating
    right through the middle of a particularly valuable-
    looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident
    wealth and breeding. SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their
    way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string
    quartet accompanying them.
    
    CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a
    wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking
    DAUGHTER in her 20s. The OLDER WOMAN is easily
    distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage
    that covers a goodish part of her head. The two of them
    (the MOTHER and DAUGHTER, not the MOTHER and bandage) are
    perusing the menus. SAM notes the DAUGHTER, unpleased.
    
                              SAM
               Mother, I thought we were going to be
               able to talk .... Oh God, she's got
               what's he name with her.
    
    SAM and his MOTHER arrive at the table.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Ida! Sam!
    
                            MOTHER
               Alma, how are you? You're looking
               wonderful! Hello, Shirley.
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (shy to Sam)
               Salt?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (to Shirley)
               Not yet.
                    (to Sam and Mother)
               Happy Christmas, Sam.
    
    She hands SAM a gaily wrapped package which obviously
    contains the same executive toy.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sorry we're late. Shall we order? Get
               it out of the way. What are you going
               to have Alma?
    
    She starts to hunt through the huge menu the MAITRE D has
    just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid
    dishes available.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               I can't make up my mind whether to
               have a number one or a number two.
               What do you recommend, Spiro?
                               
                             SPIRO
                    (conspiratorially)
               Between you and me, Madam, today the
               number two.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are
               you going to have?
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (panics quietly)
    
                             SPIRO
                    (conspiratorially)
               Between you and me, Mademoiselle,
               today the number one. Madam Lowry?
    
                            MOTHER
               Oh, to hell with the diet, a number
               eight, please.
    
                             SPIRO
               A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I
               may say so.
                    (to Sam)
               Monsieur?
    
                              SAM
                    (brusquely)
               A steak, please. Rare.
                    (to his mother)
               Mother, I need to ...
    
                             SPIRO
                    (piqued)
               Monsieur. Quel numero.
    
                              SAM
                    (handing back menu)
               I don't know which numero.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (writing on pad)
               Numero, trois.
    
    
    EVERYONE is a bit embarrassed here. MOTHER gives SAM a
    withering look. SPIRO stalks away.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (trying to restart things)
               Alma, you wicked thing ...
                    (indicating bandages)
               you've started your treatment.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               You noticed.
                    (enthusiastically)
               I must tell you all about it.
    
                              SAM
                    (to his mother)
               Mother, will you listen to
    
    At this moment the food arrives. SPIRO elaborately lifts
    off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the
    plates of food. Each order looks identical - a big splodge
    of brown lumpy stuff. The only differences between the
    lumps are the Identifying photographs on sticks stuck in
    each. The beautiful colour photos match the photos which
    were on the menus.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (showing off that he
                    remembers who's ordered
                    what)
               Numero huit, braised veal in wine
               sauce.
                    (he sets it in front of

               It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe
               and gone to Dr. Chapman.

               The acid man?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Really, Ida, just because his
               techniques are revolutionary ... I
               don't go around calling Dr Jaffe the
               knife man.

                    Shirley)

                            MOTHER
               I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to
               sound so ...

                          MRS TERRAIN
               That's all right Ida ... it's just
               that he's such an artist. To him,
               cutting is so crude ... so primitive.

               Acid on the other hand, can be used
               for such wonderfully subtle shading,
               such delicate nuances - just like a
               Rembrant etching ... and it's so much
               quicker. Why, if it weren't for a
               teensy-weensy complication - the
               doctor said it could have happened to
               anyone - I would have had these
               bandages off yesterday.

                            SHIRLEY
                    (to Sam, after attracting
                    her mother's attention and
                    receiving a nod)
               Salt?
    
    They are just about to dip into their respective splodges
    when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is
    blasted out of the wall to the kitchen. Chaos erupts
    around the carnage as WAITERS try putting out the flames
    with extinguishers. PEOPLE, bloody and dying, are moaning.
    The DINERS not actually affected by the blast look up for
    a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to
    their meals.
    
    IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXPLOSION.

                            MOTHER
               What were we saying?
    
                              SAM
                    (picking bomb debris out of
                    his brown lump)
               This isn't rare!
    
                            MOTHER
               By the way, I saw a wonderful idea
               for Christmas presents at the
               chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift
               tokens.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Oh, that sounds marvellous.
    
                            MOTHER
               Yes, they're good at any doctor's and
               at many of the major hospitals - and
               they're accepted for gynecological
               complications including Caesarian
               section.
    
    SAM, in the act of taking in another forkful of his
    unappetising meal, drops his form in disgust
    
                              SAM
               Look - please - I'm sorry - but
               honestly, mother, this is -
    
                            MOTHER.
               I quite agree! - It's impossible!
    
    MOTHER raises her arm to gain the attention of the MAITRE
    D who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency.
    The activity in the background has increased throughout
    the conversation. The fire-brigade has arrived with sirens
    blaring. Ministry TROOPS have charged in and are arresting
    WAITERS. Stretchers have been bought in for the injured
    and these are being rushed past our little GROUP's table.
    The MAITRE D comes to the table, his DJ now blood-
    spattered.
    
                           MAITRE D
               I am sorry, Madam ... I don't know
               what to say ... this very rarely
               happens to us - I'll do what I can
               straight away
    
    He hurries away.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Really, Sam - when are you going to
               do something about these terrorists?
    
                              SAM
               What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

                            MOTHER
               Actually, Alma, that's one of the
               little things I was dying to tell you
               ... Sam's been promoted to
               Information Retrieval.

                              SAM
                    (angry and surprised)
               Mother!

                          MRS TERRAIN
               Oh that's wonderful! Congratulations
               Sam...

                            SHIRLEY
               You can show those fucking murderous
               bastards a thing or two.

                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (shocked and embarrassed)
               Shirley!
    
                              SAM
               Stop this!
                    (leaping to his feet)
               I'm not being promoted. I'm not going
               to Information Retrieval!
                    (he scrumples promotion
                    notification which he has
                    been holding and throws it
                    on the floor)
               If I want you to stick your oar in,
               mother, I'll tell you where to stick
               it!
    
    EVERYBODY is shocked. He recovers his composure slightly.
    Embarrassed, he bends, and picks up the ball of paper
    which he starts smoothing back into Its flat state.
    
                            SHIRLEY
                    (back to her uncertain
                    form)
               Pepper...?
    
                              SAM
               Look - I've got to get back -
    
    As SAM goes, MAITRE D reappears with a group of WAITERS -
    those remaining unarrested - whom he has organised to gut
    up a folding screen around the table. This cuts of the
    sight if not the noise of the VICTIMS of the explosion.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
    
                              SAM
               I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I
               don't want promotion. I don't want
               anything.
    
                            MOTHER
               Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course
               you want something. You must have
               hopes, wishes, dreams.
    
    Their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to
    rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouts loud)
               NO, NOTHING. NOT EVEN DREAMS!
    
29  EXT.   BRILLIANT SKY                     DAY             29
    
    SAM as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT, his wings straining
    as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the GIRL. They
    are rising up and away from the monolithic stone
    skyscrapers that stretch away below them.
    
                              SAM
               I'm taking you to a safe place. A
               place where they will never be able
               to get at us ... ever.
    
    An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is
    but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming
    a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and
    the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent
    just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic -
    about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he
    comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises
    from the centre of this bizarre place.
    
                              SAM
               There's no way they can approach us
               without being seen. You're safe here.
    
    He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his
    wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a
    terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.
    
    A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere
    beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the
    camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and
    down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is
    heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another.
    All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over
    the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks
    from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at
    right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with
    a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is
    heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding
    against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid
    pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out
    from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in
    its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends
    upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky
    is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is
    frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on
    above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and
    that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after
    block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the
    light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save
    her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the
    platform but it's too late.
    
    Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of
    sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and
    out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be
    heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a
    searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The
    laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something
    black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that
    appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible
    flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.
    
    He is engulfed in the black awfulness.
    
30  INT. SAM'S BEDROOM                       NIGHT           30
    
    SAM is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes. He is
    dripping with sweat and screaming. The room is
    oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat.
    It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's
    stuck.
    
    CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to
    the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to
    be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the
    kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the
    window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath.
    GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in
    through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and
    madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he
    tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He
    makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall
    gasping for air.
    CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back
    as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him
    dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open
    refrigerator. The phone rings at the other end.
    
                              SAM
                    (into phone)
               Hello - Central Services - I'm at
               579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D
               - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures
               Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover
               - and I've got trouble with the air-

               Thank you or calling Central
               Services. am sorry, due to temporary
               staff shortage, Central Services

               nice day - this has not been a
               recording, incident-
    
                              SAM
               This is an emergency!
                               
                          PHONE VOICE
               Thank you for calling Central
               Services. I am sorry, due -
    
                              SAM
               Yes, but. I've got to have a heating
               engineer
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Thank you for calling Cen -
    
    SAM slams the phone down.
    
    CUT to SAM sitting in front of the refrigerator. The door
    is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a
    desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head
    slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions
    falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.
    
31  EXT.   DARKNESS                          NIGHT           31
    
    The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are
    not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through
    space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the
    pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch
    cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the
    intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped
    and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected
    by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is
    escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM
    is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the
    tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a
    small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his
    shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way
    and SAM crashes through.
    
    CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He
    catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms
    back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on
    a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch
    he came through was the front of one of the millions of
    files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back
    into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for
    hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other
    walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is
    it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time
    Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being
    tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as
    sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms.
    The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period
    costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a
    sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer
    platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the
    side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN
    (as seen on TV).
    
                             GENT
               Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
    
                              SAM
               What? How do you know my name?
    
                             GENT
               We know everything here. This is the
               Storeroom of Knowledge.
    
                              SAM
                    (climbing onto the
                    platform)
               Then perhaps you can help me. I've
               lost someone who ...
    
                             GENT
                    (interrupting)
               We know that too. You've come to the
               right place.
    
    The platform carries them along the files.
    
                             GENT
               Oh, yes. We've got everything here.
               Every bit of knowledge, wisdom,
               learning ... every experience, every
               thought neatly filed away.
    
                              SAM
                    (incredulous)
               What? You mean you've got ...
    
                             GENT
               Well not exactly. But, if you help us
               we'll help you. The Forces Of
               Darkness have won the day ... but,
               tomorrow is another one
    
                              SAM
               What do I have to do.
    
                             GENT
               You must save the day.
    
    The platform has stopped. The GENT pulls out a drawer. He
    reaches inside.
    
    The GENT pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.
    
                             GENT
               This is the Sword Of Truth ... and
               this the Helmet Of Justice.
    
    As SAM begins to strap on the weapon the GENT brings out a
    cape.
    
                             GENT
               And this. completes the outfit.
    
    He puts the cape around SAM's shoulders and helps him step
    into the drawer. A moment's hesitation and then SAM outs
    the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. It fits just
    like a coffin.. As he lies back the GENT pushes the drawer
    in.
    
                             GENT
               It won't be pleasant but, trust me.
    
    As the drawer is pushed in SAM suffers a sudden bout of
    claustrophobia. Looking up at the diministing opening he
    is surprised to see - not the face of the JOLLY GENT - but
    a terrifying SAMURAI WARRIOR's masked helmet. SAM
    struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.
    
32  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           32
    
    SAM is grabbing the walls of the fridge. Water from the
    defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. He wakes
    up. Before he can really take in where he is the phone
    rings. He staggers over to it.
    
                              SAM
               Hello ... hello ...
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Hello. Mr Lowry?
    
                              SAM
               Who's that?
                    (pause)
    
    A sound at the kitchen door turns SAM's head - and ours -
    just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but
    then a rapid voice in his ear-piece brings his head back.
    
                          PHONE VOICE
               Put the phone down and your hands up.
    
                              SAM
                    (into the phone)
               What? Who is this?
    
    SAM realises that the voice is also in the room behind
    him. He turns round and sees TUTTLE. TUTTLE is middle-
    aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes
    suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid
    commando. In one hand he holds a gun pointed at SAM. The
    other hand is holding a telephone receiver which TUTTLE is
    in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his
    feet. SAM puts down his phone, and his hands up.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Nice and easy now. Keep your hands
               where I can see them.
    
                              SAM
               What is this?
                    (indignantly)
               Who the hell are you?
    
    TUTTLE, keeping the gun on SAM, goes to different doors,
    leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.
    
    TUTTLE suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At
               your service.
    
                              SAM
               Tuttle! Are you from Central
               Services?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Ha!!
    
                              SAM
               But ... I called Central Services.
    
                            TUTTLE
               They're a bit overworked these days.
               Luckily I intercepted your call.
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
    By now, BOTH are pouring with sweat.
    TUTTLE heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a
    wall panel.
    
                              SAM
               Wait a minute, what was that business
               with the gun?
    
    TUTTLE hands SAM the panel and plunges his arm into the
    space behind it.
    
                            TUTTLE
               A little precaution, sir. I've had
               traps set for me before now. There
               are people in Central Services who'd
               love to get their hands on Harry
               Tuttle.
    
                              SAM
               Are you saying this is illegal?
    
    By now TUTTLE has managed to pull out some sections of
    flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal
    behind the removed panel. It is all very complicated and
    greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where
    that came from. TUTTLE is amazingly neat and deft as he
    works. A real pro. As he works he hums a wee tune ... yes
    ... BRAZIL!!
    
                            TUTTLE
               Well, yes ... and no. Officially,
               only Central Service operatives are
               supposed to touch this stuff ...
               Could you hold these.
    
                            TUTTLE
                    (he hands Sam a bunch of
                    wires that he has detached)
               ... but, with all the new rules and
               regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon
               ... they can't get decent staff any
               more ... so ... they tend to turn a
               blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.
                    (he hands Sam a torch)
               ... Mind you, if ever they could
               prove I'd been working on their
               equipment ... well, that's a
               different matter ... up a bit with
               the torch, sir.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to
               work for Central Services?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're
               getting warm -
    
                              SAM
               The pace?
    
                            TUTTLE
               The paperwork, couldn't stand the
               paperwork.
                    (indicating the torch)
               Over to the left please, if you don't
               mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's
               more bits of paper in Central
               Services than bits of pipe - read
               this, fill in that, hand in the other
               - listen, this old system of yours
               could be on fire and I couldn't even
               turn on the kitchen tap without
               filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody
               paperwork.
    
                              SAM
                    (mildly)
               Well I suppose one has to expect a
               certain amount
    
                            TUTTLE
               Why? I came into this game for
               adventure - go anywhere, travel
               light, get in, get out, wherever
               there's trouble, a man alone. Now
               they've got the whole country
               sectioned of and you can't move
               without a form. I'm the last of a
               breed. Ah ha! Found it!
                    (he holds up a small
                    charred gadget)
               There's your problem.
    
                              SAM
               Can you fix it?
    
                            TUTTLE
               No. But I can bypass it with one of
               these
    
    He pulls another gadget from his bag.
    
                              SAM
               Fine.
    
    The door bell. TUTTLE grabs for his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Are you expecting anyone?
    
                              SAM
               No. Wait here.
    
    He goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the
    front door which he opens. He is confronted by two
    officious little men in boiler suits who are standing
    outside his door. Their names are SPOOR and DOWSER. DOWSER
    is SPOOR's echo.
    
                              SAM
               Yes?
    
                             SPOOR
               Central Services.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ervices.
    
                              SAM
               Uh - what? - I ...
    
                             SPOOR
               You telephone, sir.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...elephoned sir.
    
                             SPOOR
               Trouble with your air-conditioning.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ditioning.
    
                              SAM
                    (gulps)
               No, not at all. I mean, it's all
               right. It's fixed.
    
                             SPOOR
               Fixed?
    
                            DOWSER
               Fixed?
    
    They don't like that.
    
                              SAM
               I mean it fixed itself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Fixed itself.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ixed itself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Machines don't fix themselves.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... fix themselves.
    
                             SPOOR
               He's tampered with it, Dowser.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ampered. with it, Spoor.
    
                              SAM
               Look, I'm sorry about your wasted
               journey
    
    SAM tries to close the door but SPOOR prevents this.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (to Dowser)
               I think we'd better have a look.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... have a look.
    
                              SAM
               No you can't.
    
    He is pushed aside. SPOOR followed by DOWSER, heads for
    the door behind which is MR TUTTLE. SAM is paralysed.
    SPOOR approaches the door as if it is dangerous. He turns
    the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. The
    door begins to swing slowly open. SAM suddenly finds
    inspiration.
    
                              SAM
               Just a minute!
    
    SPOOR and DOWSER turn round as the door continues to swing
    open. When the door is open, behind their backs TUTTLE is
    seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip, his knees
    slightly bent. TUTTLE freezes like that, pointing his
    pistol through the open door.

                              SAM
               Have you got a 27B/6?
    
    DOWSER looks very angry. Veins stand out on his forehead
    and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit. SPOOR
    knocks him to the ground.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (to Sam)
               Now look what you've done to him.
    
                              SAM
               Have you got one or haven't you?
    
                             SPOOR
               Not ... as such ...
    
    DOWSER moans and begins to get back on his feet.
    
                             SPOOR
               But we can get one.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (worried about Dowser)
               It's all right, Terry, it's all
               right, everything's all right.
    
                              SAM
                    (ushering them to the door)
               I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a
               stickler for paper work. Where would
               we be if we didn't follow the correct
               procedures?
    
                             SPOOR
               We'll be back.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...Be back.
    
                              SAM
                    (Closing the door on them)
               Thank you.
    
    SAM turns back to TUTTLE who is coming forward pocketing
    his gun.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Thanks, Lowry, you're a good man in a
               tight corner.

    TUTTLE returns to work, fitting in the new by-pass gadget
    and tightening the nuts, and happily humming "BRAZIL".
    
                              SAM
               Listen .. um ... I don't want to get
               involved in any of this. But I work
               at the Ministry of Information, and I
               happen to know that Information
               Retrieval have been looking for an
               Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer.
               You wouldn't by any chance be -
    
                            TUTTLE
                    (pleased)
               My friends call me Harry. Information
               Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
    
                              SAM
               What do they want you or?
    
                            TUTTLE
               Time to go.
    
    TUTTLE finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag.
    
                              SAM
               Thank you very much. How much will
               it...?
    
                            TUTTLE
               On the house. You did me a favor.
               Check the corridor.
    
    SAM goes to the front door, opens it and looks out.
    
                              SAM
               All clear.
    
    TUTTLE slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor.
    
                              SAM
               Hey that's a dead end.
    
    But TUTTLE merely undoes a pre-arranged rope and swings
    Tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi-
    story void to a neighboring block. SAM is amazed - not to
    say - stunned.
    
33  INT.   RECORDS POOL                      DAY             33
    
    SAM is at his desk among all the desks. Documents are
    being delivered right, left and centre through the vacuum
    tubes. All the CLERKS are busy. The screens are devoted to
    their proper use. All this activity is explained by the
    fact the MR KURTZMAN's door is wide open. At the next desk
    is another CLERK much like SAM, his NEIGHBOUR.
    
                           NEIGHBOUR
               I think Kurtzman getting is
               suspicious.
    
                              SAM
               What have we got on today?
    
                           NEIGHBOUR
               Casablanca.
    
    KURTZMAN appears in his doorway.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (calls out)
               Mr Lowry! Would you step in here a
               moment please.
    
    We go with KURTZMAN as he closes the office door behind
    him, we are now in ...
    
    
34  INT.   KURTZMAN'S OFFICE                 DAY             34
    
    KURTZMAN is pacing anxiously. SAM walks into the office.
    During the brief opening and closing of the door we just
    manage to hear the piano player in "Casablanca" singing,
    "... a kiss is just a kiss ...". KURTZMAN is too worried
    to notice. He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if
    it were contagious. He waves it frantically as SAM enters.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (hysterically)
               Thank God you're here! We're in
               terrible trouble! Look at this! Look
               at this!
    
    He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking the paper)
               A cheque.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               The refund for Tuttle!
    
                              SAM
                    (startled)
               Tuttle?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion
               from the word go! He's been wrongly
               charged for Electromemorytherapy and
               someone somewhere is trying to make
               us carry the can!
    
                              SAM
               I've never seen a Ministry cheque
               before.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               We've got to get rid of it! There's
               been a balls-up somewhere, and when
               the music stops they'll jump on
               whoever's holding the cheque!
    
                              SAM
               Send it to somebody else. Send it to
               Buttle. It's his cheque.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I've tried that! Population Census
               have got him down as dormanted, the
               Central Collective Storehouse
               computer has got him down as deleted,
               and the Information Retrieval have
               got him down as inoperative ...
               Security has him down as excised.,
               Admin have him down as completed
    
                              SAM
               Hang on.
    
    SAM sits down at the console and punches keys. He does
    this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally
    demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves KURTZMAN
    way out of his depth, until -
    
                              SAM
               He is dead.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll
               never get rid of the damned thing!
               What are we going to do?
    
                              SAM
               Try next of kin.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (a revelation)
               Next of kin!
    
    SAM punches more keys.
    
                              SAM
               There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle.
               What's the number on the cheque?
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (reading it)
               27156789/074328/K.
    
    SAM has been efficiently punching this in.
    
                              SAM
               Into memory. Now ... Central Banking
               ... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit
    
    SAM rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque
    into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. A job well
    done.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (fervently)
               Please don't come back! Please don't
               come back!
    
    Unfortunately KURTZMAN's prayers are not answered and the.
    vacuum tube returns almost immediately. SAM opens it up.
    From the computer screen comes a voice "Play it again,
    Sam" - SAM and KURTZMAN look at the screen. We get a quick
    glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to
    numbers.
    
                              SAM
               Problem. She doesn't have a bank
               account.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (hysterically)
               Well, that's it! I may as well go and
               hang myself! This sort of thing
               couldn't have happened before the
               stupid seventh tier reorganization!
               That was Simmons doing! And he and
               Jeffries always sit together at
               lunch! The bastards!
                    (he thumps his hand hard on
                    the desk top)
               Ow!
                    (He picks up the offending
                    cheque)
               Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the
               filing cabinet ... or destroy it ...
               burn it ... eat it ...
    
    Under this tirade SAM has begun to hum "BRAZIL" - not
    entirely sure what inspired him.
    
                              SAM
               You'd never get away with it.
               Besides, you can't do that to
               somebody's refund. It's Christmas.
               There is one more option.
    
                           KURTZMAN
                    (depressed. Not really
                    believing it)
               What?
    
                              SAM
               Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the
               cheque, tell her to sign her name on
               the back, cash it at the corner sweet
               shop.
    
    KURTZMAN is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               That's brilliant!
    
    SAM takes over. In no time at all he has battered away at
    the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and
    received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf
    of different coloured papers.
    
                              SAM
               I'll do it for you. Authorise the
               cheque. What's the address?
    
    KURTZMAN scribbles it down for him.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Here. What do I do next?
    
                              SAM
               Call the motor pool and authorise
               personal transport.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Of course, of course. Leave it to me.
               How do I authorize a cheque?
    
                              SAM
                    (separating the and blue
                    sheets)
               Here we are. Pink and blue receipts.
               All you've got to do is sign these
               and the back of the cheque.
    
    KURTZMAN takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers
    but his hand is giving him trouble.
    

                           KURTZMAN
                    (exhausted after all the
                    emotion)
               Oh God! I think I've broken a bone.
               What a pathetic thing I am.

                              SAM
               (taking the pen from him)
               Here.

    SAM signs the cheque and receipts. A big CLOSE UP shows
    that he is scribbling KURTZMAN's signature. SAM pockets
    the papers and the pen.

                              SAM
               That's it.

                           KURTZMAN
               You are good to me Sam.

                              SAM
                    (leaving)
               Don't mention it. See you later.

35  EXT.   MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             35
    CUT to SAM at the wheel of the little car, beetling along
    in a seemingly endless, tube-like tunnel, menaced fore and
    aft by huge buses, lorries and other carriers which
    literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road
    surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck.
    
    CUT to SAM in interior of the Messerschmidt. He is singing
    along to an obscure arrangement of "BRAZIL".
    
                             RADIO
                    (plays music for a moment
                    which then fades out)
               ... We interrupt this programme to
               bring you news of a terrorist bombing
               at the ...
                    (Sam switches off)
    
    
36  EXT.   MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             36
    
    CUT to exterior view of Messerschmidt still merrily
    progressing in arterial tunnel. CUT to very tiny exit
    sign: Exit 49.
    
    CUT to SAM peering at sign.
    
    CUT to Messerschmidt taking the exit just as a huge lorry
    roars by.
    
    
37  EXT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             37
    
    Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the
    sunlight. Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's
    model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre
    of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work -
    graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. In the
    background is the grim reality of the massive housing
    tower. SAM's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow
    of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. Huge
    conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. SAM gets out
    of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a
    few LOCALS. Self-consciously, SAM looks around him, then
    at the paper in his hand. A little group of KIDS sit
    pitching pennies against a wall. SAM goes over to them.
    
                              SAM
                    (super polite)
               Excuse me. Can you tell me ...
    
    But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny KID looks up.
    
                              KID
               Eff off.
    
    SAM, uncomfortably, effs off.
    
    He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the
    little GIRL BUTTTLE. As SAM enters the buildings one of
    the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the
    car. Another is fiddling, with a box of matches.
    
    
38  INT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             38
    
    CUT to SAM hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby
    of the big block of flats. Graffiti, vandalism are in
    evidence everywhere. He walks up to the lift. Pushes the
    button. Nothing happens. He pushes again. This time the
    lift door shudders and sparks. SAM tries to pull the doors
    apart. They jam open with a three-inch gap between them -
    still shuddering and grinding. In the sparking light, SAM
    can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old
    furniture, dead cats. Yechhhh. Resignedly, he turns
    towards the stairs.
    
    
39  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             39
    CUT to SAM coming breathlessly out of the stairwell. On
    the wall next to it is the number 37. Walking down the
    corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but
    then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to
    knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles
    for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly.
    
               SAM
               Mrs Buttle
                    (silence)
               Uh, Mrs Buttle?
                    (silence)
    
    SAM stands not knowing what to do.
    SAM pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts
    about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat.
    CUT to SAM's POV of darkish hall.
    
                              SAM
               Mrs Buttle ...
    
40  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING ROOM               DAY             40
    
    CUT to SAM entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded
    in half-darkness. This is the same flat from which the
    FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is
    still in the ceiling. SAM becomes aware of a woman sitting
    absolutely still at a small table by the only (still
    broken) window in the room.
    
                              SAM
               Are you Mrs Buttle?
    
    The WOMAN nods very slightly without looking at him.
    
                              SAM
               My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I'm
               from the Ministry of Information.
                    (no response)
               I've come to give you a cheque.
    
    SAM takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the
    table to tempt MRS BUTTLE into a flicker of interest but
    she fails to notice it - or him for that matter. SAM
    pushes the cheque a little way towards MRS BUTTLE but she
    does not respond.
    
                              SAM
                    (indicting cheque)
               It's a refund ... I'm afraid there
               was a mistake.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               Mistake?
    
                              SAM
                    (encouraged)
               Yes. Not my department ... I'm only
               records. It seems that Mr Buttle was
               overcharged by Information Retrieval.
               I don't think they usually make
               mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose
               we're all human.
    
    SAM looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.
    
               Oh ... what happened to the ...?
    
    He gets nothing back.
    
               Actually, my bringing this here is
               rather unorthodox ... Usually any
               payments are made through the central
               computer ... but, er ... there were
               certain difficulties, and rather than
               cause delay, we thought you might
               appreciate this now ... it being
               Christmas.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               My husband's dead, isn't he?
    
                              SAM
               Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the
               Ministry is always very scrupulous
               about following up and eradicating
               error. If you have any complaints
               which you'd like to make, I'd be more
               than happy to send you the
               appropriate forms.
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               What have you done with his body?
    
                              SAM
               Um ...
    
    MRS BUTTLE starts to cry.
    
                              SAM
               Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
               I don't know anything about it ...
               I'm really just delivering the
               cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind
               signing these receipts
                    (producing blue and pink
                    receipts)
               I'll go and leave you in peace.
    
    SAM picks up the cheque and gives it to MRS BUTTLE
    together with the receipts. MRS BUTTLE tears them up and
    throws them in his face.
    
                              SAM
               Uh ...
    
                          MRS BUTTLE
               He hadn't done anything ... He was
               good ... What have you done with his
               body?
    
    SAM looks around for an escape and sees a YOUNG BUTTLE
    standing in the doorway. The BOY is looking at him with a
    blank tearful face. Suddenly the BOY launches himself at
    SAM with terrible ferocity. SAM is knocked against the
    wall. A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the
    floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his
    hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull
    the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on
    his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and
    shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the
    BOY.
    
    From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the
    floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's
    head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is
    unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems
    unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of
    mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now.
    
                             JILL
               Are you alright?
    
                              SAM
                    (mumbles)
               It's you ... it's you ...
    
                             JILL
               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
    
    SAM grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the
    angle so that the vision disappears. He looks for the
    vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to
    realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up,
    dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the
    ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only
    the empty space of the hole.
    
                              SAM
               Wait! Stop! Come back!!
    
    MRS BUTTLE is shouting. SAM rushes out of the flat.
    
    
41  INT.   BUTTLE'S CORRIDOR                 DAY             41
    
    SAM looks both ways and heads for the stairs.
    
    
42  INT.   BUTTLE'S STAIRCASE                DAY             42
    
    SAM runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds
    himself in -
    
    
43  EXT.   SIMILAR CORRIDOR                  DAY             43
    
    He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the
    doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock
    at. He hesitates. He rings the bell on what he hopes is
    the right door. The bell doesn't work. He bangs on the
    door. The door opens a crack. A malevolent eye looks at
    him.
    
                              SAM
               Girl ... fair hair ...
    
    The door shuts firmly. SAM rushes to the next door.
    
    
44  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       DAY             44
    
    SAM bursts into JILL's flat. He sees the hole in the
    floor. The place looks derelict. He hears an explosion and
    looks out of a window to see his car in flames. JILL is
    apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. She is
    carrying a suitcase and bundles.
    
    
45  INT.   STAIRCASE                         DAY             45
    
    SAM rushes down the stairs.
    
    
46  EXT.   BLOCK OF FLATS                    DAY             46
    
    SAM charges out into the open air. JILL has disappeared.
    The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames. SAM doesn't know
    which way to turn. Spotting an old mattress lying by the
    building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an
    attempt to smother the flames. The group of CHILDREN watch
    him silently. Suddenly with a great roar, JILL's lorry
    comes round the corner at speed. SAM sees that JILL is at
    the wheel. SAM runs after the lorry.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouting)
               Wait! It was nothing to do with me!
    
    The lorry roars away. SAM dashes back to his smoldering
    three-wheeler. He flings himself into it and starts it up.
    He also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all
    three wheels have been removed. He turns round in despair
    and sees the group of CHILDREN regarding him
    expressionlessly.
    
    They include the little GIRL BUTTLE.
    
    Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. A
    shadow passes across his face. Looking up he sees GIRL
    BUTTLE standing over him.
    
                              SAM
               Go away.
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Her name is Jill.
    
                              SAM
               What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               Layton.
    
                              SAM
               Jill Layton ...
                    (getting up)
               You're a very good little girl. What
               are you doing here?
    
                          GIRL BUTTLE
               I'm waiting for my daddy.
    
                              SAM
                    (uncomprehending)
               He will be pleased when he comes
               home.
    
    GIRL BUTTLE doesn't answer and SAM starts to walk away.
    After a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back
    to look at the little GIRL BUTTLE who stands alone
    patiently in the vandalised wilderness.
    
    
47  INT.   RECORD CLERKS POOL                DAY             47
    
    It is the end of the work day. The CLERKS are busily
    getting their coats and leaving the office. As the last
    one goes MR. KURTZMAN comes out of his private office with
    his hat and coat on. He turns out the office light. He
    sees SAM isolated in the empty room, still working at his
    computer console. Totally absorbed in what he is doing.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Oh ... Sam. I've had the transport
               pool onto me ... You don't know
               anything about a personnel
               transporter gone missing do you?
    
    SAM doesn't seem to hear him. On the computer screen is a
    front and side view picture of JILL. Her name and code
    number is at the top of the screen. SAM is punching up
    personal dossier information like "age", "height",
    "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes",
    "distinguishing marks" etc.
    
                              SAM
                    (preoccupied)
               A "personnel" transporter? They've
               got it wrong. I had a personal
               transporter. I'll do the paperwork
               tomorrow -
    
    SAM punches up a few more categories for JILL's dossier.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's
               cheque?
    
                              SAM
               I delivered it.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Can I forget it?
    
                              SAM
               Yes.
    
    SAM punches a few more buttons on the computer.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What a relief!
                    (on reflection)
               I shall probably have nightmares.
    
    At this point the word "Classified" superimposes itself
    over most of the screen and "IRQ/3" starts agitating at
    the bottom
    
                              SAM
               Damn! Blast!
    
                           KURTZMAN
               What's the matter?
    
                              SAM
               You don't happen to know how I can
               get around an IRQ/3 do you?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               All information on 3rd Level Suspects
               is classified.
    
                              SAM
               I know that.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               All enquiries to Information
               Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of
               course. They never tell you anything.
               But come the time they want something
               from us ...
    
    Throughout this verbal wallpaper SAM has been punching
    keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint. He then punches
    in the code for a hard-copy print-out. JILL's two-view
    computer portrait rolls out as SAM ponders his options.
    
                              SAM
                    (cutting off Kurtzman)
               I've go to accept that promotion to
               get behind this, haven't I?
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Yes.
                    (realising what he's
                    suggesting)
               NO! You can't! You've only just
               turned it down!
                    (thinking Sam is joking)
    
                              SAM
               I never signed the form.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               I did it for you.
    
                              SAM
               What! Shit!
               
                           KURTZMAN
               It's what you wanted isn't it?
    
                              SAM
               Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
    
    KURTZMAN picks up JILL's print-out and glances at it. He
    grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.
    
                           KURTZMAN
               Come on, before they turn the lights
               out.
    
    SAM nods. He turns off the machine. He stands up and
    follows KURTZMAN towards the door. The door is some
    distance away, and before they get there all the lights go
    out. KURTZMAN bumps into a desk and curses.
    
    
48  INT.   TRANSPORT CAGE                    EVENING         48
    
    Packed tightly between other passengers SAM is busy
    drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer
    print-out of JILL turning her into the DREAM GIRL. The
    transport cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a
    tower block.
    
    
49  INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    EVENING         49
    
    The transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end
    of SAM's corridor. Passengers disembark and head for
    various doors along the corridor. SAM almost fails to get
    off in time - so concentrated on JILL's picture is he.
    Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about
    something he heads for his own front door.
    
    
50  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        EVENING         50
    
    SAM enters. The place is in a state of turmoil. Servicing
    panels are off the walls. Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown
    mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was
    disemboweled. SPOOR stands in the middle of it all trying
    to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring
    plans which seem to make little sense to them. DOWSER is
    not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and
    banging going on somewhere behind the wall.
    
                              SAM
               What the - ? How did you - ?
    
                             SPOOR
               Emergency procedures.
    
                         DOWSER (O.S.)
                    (muffled)
               ...ergency procedures.
    
                              SAM
                    (angrily)
               I haven't got an emergency. Get out
               of here.
    
    For reply SPOOR whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag
    and plays back SAM's original phone call to Central
    Services, claiming "an emergency". SPOOR shuts off his
    machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what
    looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper
    between each page. SPOOR indicates the bottom of page 1.
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign here please.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             SPOOR
                    (surprised)
               It's a 27B/6, what did you think it
               was?
    
    SAM takes out KURTZMAN's old-fashioned fountain pen from
    his pocket, signs where indicated. SPOOR registers that
    SAM's signature has hardly penetrated through he first
    carbon let alone the other 43
    
                             SPOOR
                    (sourly)
               Haven't you got a ballpoint?
    
    SAM resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by
    one. SPOOR realises that DOWSER's echo has gone missing.
    
                             SPOOR
               Now where's he got to?
                    (shouts)
               Dowser!
    
    DOWSER bursts through a panel in the wall. This is the
    panel which TUTTLE had removed and replaced. A few of the
    flat's intestines have come out with DOWSER. DOWSER has
    made a find - TUTTLE's spare part.
    
                             SPOOR
               What have you got there?
    
                            DOWSER
                    (highly excited)
               Got there!
    
    DOWSER points to TUTTLE's spare part which is hanging out
    of the wall attached to rubber tube. SPOOR examines this
    closely. SAM watches alarmed. The TWO MEN go into a
    mumbling huddle.
    
                             SPOOR
               Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ...
               Tuttle
    
                            DOWSER
               Mumble ... Tuttle ...
    
                             SPOOR
               Tuttle! ... mumble!
                    (to Sam)
               You've had that scab Tuttle here,
               haven't you?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...aven't you?
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             SPOOR
               Who fixed your ducts?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...your ducts?
    
                              SAM
               I fixed it myself.
    
                             SPOOR
               Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh
                    (he holds up Tuttle's spare
                    part)
               out yer nostril?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...Yer nostril?
    
                             SPOOR
               Central Services don't take kindly to
               sabotage!
    
                            DOWSER
               ...sabotage!
    
    SPOOR and DOWSER and the other workmen gather up their
    tools - put them in the bag, grab everything else that
    belongs to them and are leaving. SPOOR grabs the form-book
    out of SAM's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that
    page at SAM, shoves the book into his bag. The WORKMEN
    begin leaving the flat.
    
                              SAM
               Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't
               just go and leave it like this!
    
                             SPOOR
                    (mock innocent)
               Why not? All you've got to do is blow
               yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
    
                            DOWSER
               ...ven't you?
    
                             SPOOR
                    (leaving)
               You're putting your talents to very
               odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to
               pit wits against Central Services -
    
                            DOWSER
               ...sod you, stupid twit.
    
    They go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving SAM in the
    ruins of his flat.
    
    SAM stands in the maimed sitting-room. Wall panels are
    off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room
    like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a
    couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently
    hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the
    print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the
    DREAM GIRL.
    
    
51  EXT.   CONDUIT FOREST                    NIGHT           51
    
    DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to
    reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest
    of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through
    the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him.
    Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering
    before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke
    and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.
    
    
52  EXT.   CLOUDS                            NIGHT           52
    
    CUT to SAM plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape
    twisting around him. Somehow he manages to wrestle it
    clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape
    up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out
    until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent.
    Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.
    
    
53  EXT.   STRANGE LANDSCAPE                 ANTI-DAY        53
    
    SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange
    mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the
    occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long
    lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant
    cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The
    black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the
    PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages.
    The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light.
    The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a
    black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.
    
    CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards
    the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated,
    destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them
    forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a
    stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear
    raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS
    turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach -
    a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We
    see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is
    MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and
    the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback.
    A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the
    sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward.
    But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins
    to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a
    mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and
    the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the
    opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black
    flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high
    into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into
    the light. There, under several meters of the earth's
    crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful
    blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen
    in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the
    crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet
    high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient
    Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he
    made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a
    horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that
    was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of
    Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is
    unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being
    loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face
    the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands
    ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in
    an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does
    the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees
    that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter
    from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the
    ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the
    ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black
    flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the
    trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is
    severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking
    around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned
    cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and
    begins chopping the tethers away.
    The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last
    restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but
    before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg
    halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is
    caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands.
    Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the
    smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The
    face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to
    the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.
    
                   MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND
               Don't go! It's a trap! She's not what
               she seems.
    
    SAM kicks and strains but the hands hold firm.
    
    
54  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           54
    
    SAM wakes up. His feet are entangled in some wiring and
    ducting. He is still in his devastated sitting room. As he
    untangles himself the door bell rings. It takes a moment
    for SAM to recognise it as the door bell. Annoyed and
    still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the
    door. He opens it. In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly
    bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and
    big-bowed tap dancing shoes. She launches into a terrible
    song and dance routine.
    
                        GIRL (singing)
               Mrs Ida Lowry requests the pleasure
                 of your companyyyy
                 at her apartment tonight,
               from eight thirtyyyy
                 midnight
               to celebrate the completion
                 of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy
               The guest of honour will be
                 Mr Conrad Helpmann,
               Dep. Under Minister of State
                 for Public Information,
               R.S.V.P. by singing telegram.
    
    SAM and the GIRL stand looking at each other uneasily for
    a moment.
    
                              SAM
               Er ... Thanks ...
    
                             GIRL
               It's reply paid.
    
                              SAM
               Oh ...
                    (he sings uncertainly)
               Thank you very much, mother, but
               actually -
    
                             GIRL
               You don't have to sing it.
    
                              SAM
               Oh, right ...
    
    The GIRL begins to dance again - but this time in a rather
    strange strangled fashion.
    
                              SAM
                    (he looks at his watch)
               Aren't you a bit late? - the party
               started half an hour ago.
    
                             GIRL
               Yes, I know. It's the backlog,
               everybody complains. Was it all right
               otherwise?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank
               you.
    
                             GIRL
               Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
    
    
55  INT.   MOTHER' S CORRIDOR                NIGHT           55
    
    SAM rings the doorbell to his mother's flat. He is
    wearing. an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie - obviously his
    only dress outfit. The door is opened by a LIVERIED FLUNKY
    who's about to speak when an attractive 40-year old
    woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses SAM
    over the threshold.
    
                             WOMAN
               Sam, I'm so glad you came. Do come
               in.
    
    
56  INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT           56
    
    SAM steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him.
    The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less
    formally dresses than SAM. It is an elegant baroque room -
    lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous
    Central Service ducts that thrust through antique
    tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for
    aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.
    
                              SAM
                    (bewildered)
               Mother? Is that you?
    
                            MOTHER
                    (taking his arm - looking
                    slightly askance at his
                    clothes)
               Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The
               bandages came of this afternoon. Come
               and join the fun. Everybody's here.
    
                              SAM
               Is Mr Helpmann here?
    
                            MOTHER
               Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
    
                              SAM
               I want to talk to him.
    
    SAM pushes away the FLUNKY who is by now passing a metal
    detector over him.
    
                            MOTHER
               It seems you're the first person ever
               to turn down a promotion. He thinks
               you should see a doctor.
    
                              SAM
               Actually, I've decided ...
    
    DR JAFFE hoves into view.
    
                            MOTHER
               Oh, Louis! You know Sam.
    
    DR JAFFE is no longer suave. He has been transformed by
    drink and success. Mostly by drink.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (as high as a kite)
               Can you believe it?! Just me and my
               little knife! Snip - snip - slice -
               slice - Can you believe it?
    
                              SAM
                    (repelled)
               Congratulations ...
    
                           DR JAFFE
               And this is just the beginning!!
    
                              SAM
               Really?
    
                           DR JAFFE
               Chirst yes, you've seen her with her
               clothes off. Faces are a doddle
               compared to tits and arse.
                    (explains)
               No hairline.
    
                            MOTHER
                    (primly)
               Really, Louis.
    
    A handsome young piece of BEEFCAKE delivers a drink to
    MOTHER.
    
                           BEEFCAKE
               I've been looking everywhere for you,
               Ida.
    
    The BEEFCAKE takes MOTHER away.
    
                           DR JAFFE
               Ah, dear boy ... And what do you
               think of your mother now?
    
                      VOICE (off camera)
               It will never last.
    
    SAM and DR JAFFE turn to see who is speaking. It is DR
    CHAPMAN a tall, pipe-smoking, professional-looking gent.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (a trifle haughtily)
               Excuse me, Dr Chapman, did you say
               something?
    
                          DR CHAPMAN
               That technique ... I've tried it. A
               nice effect. But highly unstable. In
               six months she'll look like Grandma
               Moses.
    
    SAM wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but
    suddenly freezes - the reflection in the large wall mirror
    next to him is not that of the party guests - but of the
    GREY PRISONERS in his dream - they are massed in the room
    looking pleadingly towards him.
    
                           DR JAFFE
                    (unsuave again)
               Now see here, Chapman. At least mine
               don't look like they've been mugged.
    
    Through the GREY PRISONERS pushes MRS TERRAIN.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (calls)
               Sam!
    
    SAM turns around to see her pushing through the party
    guests.
    
    MRS TERRAIN is limping and is even more heavily swathed in
    bandages than the last time.
    
    DR CHAPMAN hastily moves away as MRS TERRAIN comes up. She
    claims SAM, taking his arm.
    
                              SAM
                    (looking at her worriedly)
               Whatever happened to you?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               There was a slight complication. Dr.
               Chapman says it often happens with a
               delicate skin like mine. Nothing to
               worry about. He's promised me I'll
               have these bandages off in a ...
                               
                              SAM
                    (trying to disengage)
               Actually, there's someone I want to
               meet ...
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (roguishly)
               I know, I know ...!
               
    She drags SAM through the party and we arrive at her
    daughter, SHIRLEY, who is, of course, a wallflower.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Here we are! I'm going to leave you
               two lovebirds in peace.
    
                              SAM
               I ... uh ...
    
    But he is alone with SHIRLEY, standing at the entrance to
    his MOTHER's embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom.
    In amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed
    MOTHER is playing hide and seek with a YOUNG STUD.
    
                              SAM
               Can I get you a drink, Shirley?
    
    SHIRLEY looks at him terrified.
    
                              SAM
               Look ... Shirley ... your mother ...
               and my mother ... they seem to have
               got the idea ... I mean, I'm terribly
               flattered, of course, but, um, the
               thing is, I don't want you to be
               under any false ...
                               
                            SHIRLEY
                    {struggling into speech
                    shyly)
               It's ... it's ... all right ... I
               don't like you either ...
    
    This isn't what SAM expected. He smiles weakly at her.
    
                      VOICE (off camera)
               Sam!
    
    SAM turns round, to see JACK LINT a few paces away.
    
                              SAM
               Hello, Jack!
    
                             JACK
               You remember Alison?
    
    He indicates his cute blonde perfect junior executive's
    WIFE
    
                              SAM
               Hello, Alison. You look different.
    
                            ALISON
               Well, I'm two years older.
    
                             JACK
               And she's been to Dr. Jaffe!
    
    ALISON locks displeased.
    
                             JACK
                    {winking at Sam)
               She doesn't like me telling anyone
               but she's pleased as anything really.
    
                              SAM
               Er, I knew you looked different.
                               
                             JACK
               Remember how they used to stick out?
    
                              SAM
               What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to
               wonder if they were real.
    
                            ALISON
               What, my ears?
    
                              SAM
               Your ears?
    
                             JACK
               Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
    
                              SAM
                    (covering up hopelessly)
               Quite, absolutely - I always thought
               they were false.
    
                             JACK
                    (looking past Sam)
               Mr Helpmann!
    
    SAM spins round and sees a very pleasant-looking
    distinguished OLD MAN moving in their direction. He is in
    a wheelchair.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Hello, Jack.
    
                             JACK
               You remember my wife ... Alis -
    
                           HELPMANN
               Of course. Barbara isn't it? How are
               you?
                            ALISON
               Um ...
    
                             JACK
                    (instantly. Conveying to
                    Alison that she mustn't
                    object)
               Barbara's very well, thank you, sir.
               How are you?
    
                           HELPMANN
               Fine, thank you. Hello, Sam. Ida said
               you might be here. Have you got a
               minute?
                    (to Jack)
               Would you excuse us?
    
    JACK is taken aback, envious and eager to please.
    
                             JACK
               Of course .... of course ... Come on
               Alison - Barbara
    
    JACK propels his WIFE away.
    
    HELPMANN I need your help, Sam.
    
    
57  INT.   BATHROOM                          NIGHT           57
    
    It's the sort of bathroom you would expect of MOTHER, an
    adjunct to her boudoir. The pink or purple lavatory is in
    the process of flushing, while SAM holds MR HELPMANN
    vertical, grasping him under the armpits, while MR
    HELPMANN is zipping his fly.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Thanks very much Sam.
    
                              SAM
               That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to
               help.
    
    He is lowering HELPMANN into the wheelchair.
    
                           HELPMANN
               If I can help you ...
    
                              SAM
                    (broaching the subject)
               Well, I ...
    
    In maneuvering HELPMANN SAM clumsily knocks over one of
    the pretty pots which fussily decorate MOTHER's bathroom
    shelf. A thin layer of powder is spread over the wash-
    stand.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry ...
    
                           HELPMANN
               Your father and I were very close. Of
               course Jeremiah was senior to me but
               we were close friends ... especially
               after the bombing
                    (he indicates his legs)
               and I
                    (chuckles)
               keep his name alive at the office
               every day.
    
    With his finger HELPMANN is tracing letters in the
    powdered surface.
    
                           HELPMANN
               It's as though he's there speaking to
               me - "'ere I am, J.H.!" The ghost in
               the machine.
    
    We see that HELPMANN has traced the letters EREIAMJH in
    the powder.
    
                           HELPMANN
               I know he would have wanted me to
               help you ... And I promised your
               mother I'd take you onto the team at
               information Retrieval. But I gather
               that ...
    
                              SAM
               Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind.
               I'd like to accept the transfer - am
               I too late?
    
                           HELPMANN
               Too late? That's for me to say.
                               
                              SAM
               Well ... well, I ...
    
    HELPMANN puts out his hand. SAM takes it.
    
                           HELPMANN
               Welcome to Information Retrieval!
    
    HELPMANN blows away the spilled powder and EREIAMJH with
    it.

59  INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY         DAY             59
    
    CUT to WIDE SHOT of massive imposing lobby - much like the
    Records lobby - but this one is very austere. No crowds.
    No statues. No decoration. Not even the ever-present
    security checks. Impressive. And a bit unnerving. Framed
    in the doorway is a lone TINY FIGURE. CUT to CLOSE UP.
    It's SAM. He hesitates and then enters. CUT to video
    screen. The video camera follows SAM across the lobby -
    til he stops in tight profile at Reception Desk. We tilt
    up revealing SAM standing facing us just beyond the
    monitor which is on the desk.
    
                              SAM
                    (diffidently to the porter)
               My name is Sam Lowry. I have to
               report to Mr Warren.
    
                            PORTER
                    (looking down his nose at
                    Sam's unsleek clerk's suit
                    and then handing him an
                    I.D. badge)
               Thirtieth floor, sir. You're
               expected.
    
                              SAM
               Er, don't you want to search me?
    
                            PORTER
               No, sir.
    
                              SAM
                    (taken aback. Reaching into
                    his pocket)
               My I.D. cards.
    
                            PORTER
               No need, sir
    
                              SAM
                    (nonplussed)
               But I could be anybody.
    
                            PORTER
               No you couldn't, sir. This is
               Information Retrieval.
                    (indicating to the right)
               the lift's arrived, sir.
    
    
60  INT.   30TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             60
    
    SAM steps out of the lift.The lift doors close. SAM looks
    up and down the corridor hearing nothing. Silence. Then
    he, and we, begin to hear a sound. It is a curious
    whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be
    growing closer. Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into
    view around a corner at the far end of the rather long
    corridor. At the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a
    magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. This
    is MR WARREN. He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are
    competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of
    sentences. MR WARREN is snapping out decisions. Satisfied
    EXPEDITERS drop out of the scrum at intervals,
    disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors
    which line both sides of the corridor.The scrum doesn't
    get any smaller because new EXPEDITERS dart out of other
    doors and join the milling MOB. The whole circus is coming
    by SAM at the rate of knots. The sound it makes breaks
    down into something like this.
    
                          EXPEDITER 1
                    (waving pager)
               Mr Warren, this order ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 2
                    (waving same)
               Mr Warren ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 3
                    (ditto)
               About this invoice ... Victim's list
               ...
    
                            WARREN
                    (dealing on all sides)
               Yes ... No ... send that back ...
               wrong department ... of course ... of
               course not ... yes ... no ... maybe.
    
    CUT to SAM watching this caravanserai with awe as it
    starts pass him.
    
                          EXPEDITER 4
               ... about these requisitions ...
    
                          EXPEDITER 5
               Mr Warren ... EX/27 has 15 suspects
               still outstanding.
    
                          EXPEDITER 6
               ... a decision, Mr Warren ...
    
                            WARREN
               ... cancel that ... okay ... put half
               as terrorists, the rest as victims
               ... yes ... yes ... no ... definitely
               no ...
    
    SAM doesn't have the nerve to jump into this. The scrum
    sweeps by and fades away along the corridor, and finally
    disappearing around the corner at the other end. SAM
    follows. Silence has descended again.
    
    
61  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             61
    
    SAM gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar
    corridor at right angles. He hesitates and continues. Then
    he starts to hear the sound again. It is coming up from
    behind. MR WARREN has circumnavigated the building. The
    same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace.
    As the scrum reaches SAM he gathers his nerve and jumps
    right in beside WARREN, and keeps going.
    
                              SAM
                    (in a hurry)
               I'm Lowry, Mr Warren ... Sam Lowry.
    
                            WARREN
                    (putting arm around Sam)
               Ah. Lowry ... yes.
                    (still dealing with
                    Expediters)
               ... no, cancel that ... glad to have
               you aboard ... yes ... no ... don't
               be ridiculous Jenkins ... Yes, yes,
               yes ... you'll like it up here ...
               send that back ... we've got a crack
               team of ... are they kidding? ...
               decision makers ... No, in triplicate
               ... I'm expecting big things ... two
               copies to Finance ... of you ... send
               that to Security ... uh, uh, uh.
                    (poring over forms)
               Uh, don't let Progress see this ...
               between you and me, Lowry, this ...
               no, no ... department ... tell
               Records to get stuffed ... is about
               to be upgraded and ...
    
    WARREN suddenly pivots around, swinging SAM 240 degrees in
    the direction they came from plus a bit.
    
                            WARREN
               Ah, here we are!
                    (they are standing facing a
                    door - one of the hundreds
                    of identical doors lining
                    these corridors)
               What do you think?
    
    The door says: OFFICER DZ/015.
    
    SAM has no idea what he ought to say.
    
                            WARREN
                    (solemnly)
               Your very own number... on your very
               own door ... and behind that door
                    (he turns the knob and
                    opens the door)
               ... your very own office.
               Congratulations, DZ/015, welcome to
               the team.
    
    WARREN whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and EXPEDITERS
    leaving SAM standing dumfounded at the entrance to his
    office.
    
    CUT to SAM's POV of the office. It is about four feet
    wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is
    bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side
    wall. The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which
    is also bisected by the new wall. Pneumatic tubes hang
    from the ceiling. SAM slowly enters the room.
    
    
62  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             62
    
    SAM looks lost ... disoriented. He doesn't know where to
    begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes
    in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do
    starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. There in his
    "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -
    gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas &
    Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up
    his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)
    against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM
    turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they
    both fall over with a "plop". Puzzled, he stands the books
    up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". Same result.
    Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before
    his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,
    and "plop", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold
    of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the
    wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,
    somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly
    pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.
    Intrigued, SAM gets up, goes around his desk and heads for
    the door.
    
    
63  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             63
    
    Cut to SAM coming out of his office, turning right and
    walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads:
    OFFICER DV/048.
    
    As is his custom, SAM opens the door without knocking.
    
    
63a INT.   LIME'S OFFICE                     DAY            63a
    
    CUT to SAM'S POV. Here is an office much like his. It's
    the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall.
    The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking,
    round-headed little JUNIOR EXECUTIVE wholly occupied with
    trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. He
    is unaware of SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Hello.
    
    LIME startled, lets go of his desk and vents his
    irritation on SAM whom he mistakes for someone else.
    
                             LIME
               No, you can't have any more chairs!
               There's only one left in here now,
               and I need that to sit on!
                    (realizing his mistake)
               Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
    
                              SAM
               Sam Lowry.
    
                             LIME
                    (becoming unctuous)
               Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next
               door, ha ha!
                    (he advances toward Sam
                    with hand out to shake.
                    Shaking hands)
               My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome
               to Expediting.
    
                              SAM
               Ah.
                    (he pauses - looking
                    around)
               Would you mind if I borrowed your
               computer console?
    
                             LIME
               What?
    
                              SAM
               I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
    
                             LIME
               You want to take my console into your
               office?
    
                              SAM
               Yes.
    
                             LIME
                    (after a moment's
                    consideration)
               I'll tell you what .... You tell me
               what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of
               a whizz on this thing.
                    (indicates computer
                    console)
    
    SAM hesitates, but sees that there's no other way.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking print-out on Jill
                    from his pocket)
               Alright. There's someone I want to
               check out. A woman called Gillian
               Layton.
    
                             LIME
                    (leering)
               A woman eh? I see.
    
                              SAM
                    (trying to ignore this)
               I know her age and distinguishing
               marks. But I need an address or a
               place of work or something
    
                             LIME
                    (continuing to leer)
               This is your dream girl, is it?
    
                              SAM
                    (taken aback)
               What?
                    (recovering)
               Look, let me use the console for a
               few minutes.
    
                             LIME
                    (trying to be jocular)
               You must be joking -
                    (entirely unconvincing)
               When there's a woman involved -
               there's no stopping me. Now, let me
               have that sheet.
    
    He takes Jill's print-out sheet from SAM and begins to
    punch the keys laboriously with one finger. Nothing
    happens.
    
                             LIME
               Sod it, it's broken!
    
                              SAM
               You haven't switched it on.
    
                             LIME
               Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off,
               standing there! Go back to your
               office and I'll give you a knock when
               I've finished.
    
    SAM hesitates, but goes.
    
                             LIME
               Go on. I'm not going to elope with
               her.
    
    SAM exits.
    
    
64  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             64
    
    SAM is sitting in his office listening to the protracted
    one finger exercise which is going on next door. He stares
    dumbly at the shining, absolutely useless, executive toy.
    
    
65  EXT.   ICY SEA                           ANTI-DAY        65
    
    The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV
    as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming
    wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.
    
    As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing
    heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer
    still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.
    Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,
    but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a
    massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is
    engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the
    ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after
    course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we
    continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is
    looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an
    opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts
    out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and
    managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing
    thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark
    passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself
    teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull
    and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs
    curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow
    shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks
    and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM
    gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but
    his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far
    below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of
    grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks
    and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back
    and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the
    ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another
    boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as
    the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches
    at the wall.
    
    
66  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY            66
    
    SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office. The
    boom repeats. LIME is knocking on the other side. SAM
    leaps up. As he leaves his office he looks back to see the
    desk creep through to LIME's office a little bit more.
    
67  INT.   LIME'S OFFICE                     DAY             67
    SAM enters. LIME is standing, proudly holding out a sheet
    of paper.
    
                             LIME
               Computers are my forte.
    
                              SAM
                    (reading)
               Gillian Layton, age twenty three,
               eyes, blue, hair, black, weight, one
               hundred and twenty-one pounds,
               distinguishing marks, blemish on
               right shoulder, scar on left elbow
    
    He stops, having come to the end. He looks at the other
    side of the paper but there's nothing there.
    
    Is this all you got?
    
                             LIME
               It's a start isn't it.
                              SAM
                    (disbelieving)
               But I already knew this!
               
                             LIME
               Best to take it slowly where some
               women are concerned.
    
    SAM sits on LIME's chair and deftly punches the computer
    keys.
    
                             LIME
               Hey - that's my desk!
    
                              SAM
                    (working quickly)
               Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173.
               Truck driver! All enquiries,
               reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.
                    (switching off the machine
                    and getting up)
               That's what I wanted to know. Thank
               you very much.
    
    
68  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY            68
    
    SAM heads off down corridor. WARREN & CO. appear.
    
                            WARREN
               Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you ...
                    (he continues to deal with
                    expediters in between
                    dealing with Sam)
               No, send it back for ... Are you
               settling down? ... I want this order
               rescinded ... There's a query on a
               personnel transporter you took out
               from the pool ... Tell them no, tell
               them yes, ... or was it a personnel
               carrier you took out from
               transportation ... Send that up to
               Security ... Some kind of eight-wheel-
               half-track, was it? ... Tell him I
               want to see him ... Send round the
               paperwork, Lowry ... Arrange a
               conference on that one ... Anyway,
               tidy it up, Lowry, there's a good
               chap - get a new suit. Did you want
               the lift?
    
    The cavalcade is passing the lifts. SAM backs away into
    the open lift. The cavalcade passes on out of sight. The
    lift contains a CHARLADY with a bucket and mop. She
    remains in the lift as SAM joins her.
    
    
69  INT.   THE LIFT                          69
    
    SAM presses the button for the 50th floor. The lift doors
    close on him and the CHARLADY. From somewhere far away
    there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. SAM glances
    around the lift. There appears to be an air conditioning
    vent in the ceiling.
    
    SAM glances enquiringly at the CHARLADY who merely smiles
    at him. Another scream is heard.
    
                              SAM
               What's that?
    
    The CHARLADY smiles again.
    
               Doesn't that disturb you?
    
    The CHARLADY fiddles with something in her ears and pulls
    out a pair of wax earplugs.
    
                           CHARLADY
               Beg your pardon?
    
    The lift arrives.
    
    
70  INT.   50TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             70
    
    The lift arrives. SAM steps out. The CHARLADY remains in
    the lift. The doors close. SAM heads down surgically clean
    white-tiled corridor.
    
    Passing a white-coated TECHNICIAN monitoring what appears
    to be electric meters, SAM comes to a door with 5001.
    Above the door a red light is glowing. SAM knocks. The red
    light goes out and a green light comes on. SAM enters.
    
    
71  INT.   ROOM 500l                         DAY             71
    
    Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but
    the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-
    looking FEMALE typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and
    typing with great facility. SAM approaches the TYPIST who,
    busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently
    mouths the words ...
    
                            TYPIST
               It won't be long now.
                    (she carries on typing)
                    
    SAM nods, and stands quietly by her. He can hear tiny
    sounds coming through her headphones. He looks down at the
    piece of paper in the typewriter. He reacts a bit
    strangely, perhaps even winces. We see he close up of the
    words being struck crisply on paper.
    
                         ON TYPEWRITER
               AHHHH, Oh God ... No, don't ... UHH,
               please ... I ... STOP!! I can't stand
               ... AIIEEEE.
    
                            TYPIST
                    (quietly, still typing)
               Can I help you?
    
    She is looking at SAM helpfully, holding one of the
    earphones away from her ear. From this earphone we can
    just hear quietly ...
    
                           EARPHONE
               Oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ...
               arrrrrghhhh no ... please ... Oh God,
               No ... No, stop, I don't know ...
    
                              SAM
               I'm looking for Officer 412/L.
    
    The TYPIST nods smiling. She puts back the earphone and
    carries on typing.
    
                            TYPIST
               I'm sure he won't be long now.
    
    She types a little more but suddenly stops.
    
                         I thought so!
    
    She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and
    carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all
    the different copies.
    
    Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area,
    SAM can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn
    left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the TYPIST as he exits
    from sight. She is charmed. Almost immediately after them,
    a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits, but to the left.
    
                            TYPIST
               You can go in now.
    
    
72  INT.   JACK'S OFFICE                     DAY            72
    
    SAM goes through the glass door and is about to push open
    the double doors in front of him. He is halted by a noise
    from the TYPIST - she indicates that he is to go to the
    left. He does so and enters an office. An antique desk
    with a large collection of executive toys and other
    tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a
    rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall
    of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from
    entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently
    successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the
    wash basin in the far corner. The Information Retrieval
    TECHNICIAN is standing by a sink massing his temples with
    old-fashioned scalp vibrators. His back to us.
    
                              SAM
               Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?
    
    The TECHNICIAN makes no sign of having heard this. He
    continues vibrating his temples.
    
                              SAM
                    (a bit louder)
               Er, excuse me!
    
    Getting no response SAM walks over to the TECHNICIAN. As
    he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face
    down on the desk top. It seems strangely familiar - but as
    it is a negative concave image SAM isn't sure. He
    continues over to the TECHNICIAN.
    
                              SAM
                    (louder)
               Excuse me.
    
    He touches the TECHNICIAN on the shoulder, who jumps with
    a start. He spins around and turns out to be none other
    than JACK LINT. He is amazed to see SAM.
    
                              SAM
                    (surprised)
               Jack!!
    
                             JACK
                    (recovering slightly)
               SAM! What a surprise!
    
                              SAM
                    (even more surprised)
               Are you officer 412/L?
    
    JACK looks confused. He pauses, and then removes ear
    plugs.
    
                             JACK
                    (shaking Sam's hand)
               Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told
               me you were coming aboard -
               congratulations!
    
                              SAM
               Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
    
                             JACK
               For my sins. Are you settling in
               alright?
    
                              SAM
               Yes, thanks.
    
                             JACK
               Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped
               by. Unfortunately, I don't have any
               time right now I've got a queue of
               customers to deal with - er, why
               don't we have a drink tonight?
    
                              SAM
                     (diffidently)
               Ah ...
    
                             JACK
               What?
    
                              SAM
               I don't want to take up your time
               now, but I was hoping you could give
               me some information on somebody. It's
               a security level three matter and
               Information Retrieval records says to
               refer to you.
    
                             JACK
               OK. Come back this afternoon, about
               four o'clock. If you give me the
               number of the case, I'll have the
               dossier here waiting.
                    (he pulls card from his
                    pocket - pushes it towards
                    Sam)
               My tailor,... well worth the
               investment.
    
                              SAM
                    (taking print-out sheets
                    from his pocket)
               I've got numbers all over these - I'm
               not sure which is the one you want.
    
                             JACK
                    (looking at the print-out
                    picture of Jill over Sam's
                    shoulder)
               Layton! Oh shit!
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             JACK
               You clever bastard! I might have
               guessed. You only moved in today and
               you're already hot on the bloody
               trail.
    
                              SAM
    Am I?
    
                             JACK
    Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other
    on this one. If you make a reputation with this case,
    it'll be at my expense.
    
                              SAM
               How do you mean?
    
                             JACK
               How much do you know?
    
                              SAM
               Not much.
    
                             JACK
               Enough though, eh?
    
                              SAM
                    (getting sucked into this
                    exchange)
               Not really, no.
    
    JACK goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full
    blast, splashing the water noisily into the basin.
    
                             JACK
               OK. OK. Let's not fence around ...
               This is the situation. Some idiot
               somewhere in the building, some
               insect, confused two of our clients,
               B58/732 and T47/215.
    
                              SAM
               B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
    
                             JACK
               Christ! You do know it all!
    
                              SAM
               No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning
               Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
    
                             JACK
               Well, your A. Buttle has been
               confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle.
               I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should
               be shot for that. So B58/732 was
               pulled in by mistake.
    
                              SAM
               You got the wrong man.
    
                             JACK
                    (a little heated)
               I did not get the wrong man. I got
               the right man. The wrong man was
               delivered to me as the right man! I
               accepted him, on trust, as the right
               man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to
               the confusion, he died on us. Which,
               had he been the right man, he
               wouldn't have done.
    
                              SAM
               You killed him?
    
                             JACK
                    (annoyed)
               Sam, there are very rigid parameters
               laid down to avoid that event but
               Buttle's heart condition did not
               appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think
               I'm dismissing this business, Sam.
               I've lost a week's sleep over it
               already.
                               
                              SAM
               I'm sure you have
    
                             JACK
               There are some real bastards in this
               department who don't mind breaking a
               few eggs to make an omelette, but
               thank God there are the new boys like
               me who want to maintain decent
               civilized standards of terrorist
               eradication. We've got the upper hand
               for the moment, but they're waiting
               for us to slip up, and a little slip-
               up like this is just the chance
               they're looking for.
    
                              SAM
               So how ...?
    
                             JACK
               What I've got to do now is pick up
               Tuttle, interrogate him at the same
               voltage as Buttle, to the same meter
               reading to the last penny, and juggle
               the books in electrical banking.
    
                              SAM
               What has Tuttle done?
    
                             JACK
               We suspect him of freelance
               subversion.
    
                              SAM
                    (dumbly)
               He's a freelance subversive?
    
                             JACK
               He's a compulsive heating engineer. A
               maverick ex-Central Service repair
               man with a grudge against society.
               Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of
               the wood, I think. At least we will
               be when I get this Layton woman under
               arrest.
    
    JACK turns off taps and goes behind screen.
    
                              SAM
                    (agitated)
               What's she done?
    
                             JACK
               You didn't know as much about this
               business as you pretended to, did
               you?
    
                              SAM
               Er ... no.
    
                             JACK
               Very smart.
    
                              SAM
               Er ... but I would've found out
               anyway.
    
                             JACK
               Yes. I'm impressed.
    
                              SAM
                    (playing the game)
               Tell me about Layton.
    
                             JACK
               She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the
               Buttle arrest - and since then she's
               been making wild allegations,
               obviously trying to exploit the
               situation - she's working for
               somebody, and she's not working for
               us.
    
                              SAM
               A terrorist?
    
    JACK comes from behind the screen with a look confirming
    just what SAM fears, and hands him a suit.
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... thanks.
    
    SAM begins to put the suit on.
    
                              SAM
                    (hesitantly)
               But surely, I mean, perhaps she just
               happened to live above the Buttles,
               and ...
    
                             JACK
                    (picking up photograph of
                    wife and kids from his
                    desk)
               Look after that suit, eh. Barbara
               chose it for me.
    
                              SAM
               Right. Er, you're not going to keep
               calling her Barbara, are you?
    
                             JACK
               Barbara's a perfectly good name,
               isn't it?
    
                              SAM
                    (preferring to let his
                    drop)
               Look, about the Layton woman - maybe
               she's just trying to help the Buttle
               family.
    
                             JACK
               Why?
    
                              SAM
               Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
    
                             JACK
                    {baffled)
               I don't follow you.
    
                              SAM
               Out of kindness.
    
                             JACK
                    (utterly baffled)
               Kindness? What's the purpose behind
               this line of enquiry?
    
                              SAM
                    (deciding to abandon this
                    line of country)
               So what are you going to do about
               her?
    
                             JACK
               Get her out of circulation - I've put
               her on the detention list.
    
                              SAM
                    (thinking fast)
               You mean you're going to invite her
               in so that she can spill the beans
               inside the department?
    
                             JACK
                    (taken aback)
               Well, I ... Good point. What do you
               suggest?
    
                              SAM
               Let me try to get to her. I'll
               deactivate her.
    
                             JACK
               What does that mean? I don't want to
               be involved in anything unsavoury.
    
                              SAM
               Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
    
                             JACK
               Of course. We went to school
               together. You're my oldest friend.
    
                              SAM
               And you're mine.
    
                             JACK
               You're the only person I can trust.
    
                              SAM
               Then we'd better keep this business
               just between the two of us.
    
                             JACK
               Right! Just between as and the
               Security Forces.
    
                              SAM
               They weren't at school with us.
    
                             JACK
               But, I've already put her on the
               search and detain list.
    
                              SAM
               Take her off the list.
    
                             JACK
               There's no procedure for that until
               she's been arrested.
    
                              SAM
               Say it was a mistake.
    
                             JACK
               We don't make mistakes.
    
                              SAM
               Well, I'd better get out there and
               try to get to her before security
               does. Let me borrow her dossier for a
               while.
    
                             JACK
               Er ... alright. For Christ's sake
               don't lose it. Here, you'd better
               sign for it.
    
    JACK presents SAM with something to sign. He then gives
    him the dossier.
    
                              SAM
               Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
    
                             JACK
               Do you know what you're doing.
    
                              SAM
                    (about to say no, then
                    pauses)
               Trust me.
    
                             JACK
                    (admiring Sam's new look)
               Sam ... we're proud to have you at
               Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas.
                    (he hands Sam another
                    executive package)
    
    
73  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY            73
    
    SAM steps out of Room 5001, newly suited with old suit
    over arm. TWO GUARDS are guiding a BAGGEE down the
    corridor ahead of him. Suddenly, the BAGGEE breaks away
    from his GUARDS and begins to cannonball down the corridor
    directly at SAM. SAM is flattened against the wall as the
    BAGGEE rockets by.
    
    CUT to GUARDS strolling past SAM.
    CUT to BAGGEE running full tilt to the end of the
    corridor, smashing into the wall, bouncing back, getting
    up (now cross-ways in the corridor), bouncing off that
    wall, then the wall behind him, then ...
    
    
74  INT.   LIFT                              DAY            74
    
    Slightly unnerved, SAM gets in the lift, pushes the button
    for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing
    JILL's dossier. The lift descends. But unnoticed by SAM
    continued past his floor without stopping. It stops at the
    Lobby Mezzanine. SAM looks up and realizes he is on the
    wrong floor. Angrily he pushes the correct floor number
    but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice
    echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the
    direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing
    with the PORTER.
    
                             JILL
               But you've stamped this form before!
               Why won't you stamp it now?
    
                            PORTER
               You've just said yourself, Miss,
               we've already stamped it. Why should
               we stamp it twice?
    
    SAM is frozen. He can't believe what he sees. The lift
    doors close. SAM is too slow to stop them. Madly he pushes
    the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this
    point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross
    between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille
    doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall
    in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of
    dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the
    Ministry.)
    
    SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see
    SAM descending. He is shouting and rattling the bars of
    the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention.
    SAM sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying
    to stop the demon lift. From his POV we see JILL
    disappearing from view still arguing with the PORTER.
    
    
75  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            75
    
    The lift comes to rest. SAM is still trying to get it to
    respond and return him to the lobby. TWO TECHNICIANS are
    waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them
    hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the
    buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of
    the lift and is able to read the sign - "LIFT OUT OF
    ORDER". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All
    the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off
    to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it
    he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but
    there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. Before
    he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.
    
                             VOICE
               Hey, you - get out of there.
    
    A GUARD approaches looking tough and mean.
    
                             GUARD
               What do you think you're doing ...
               that's the Deputy Minister's lift.
    
                              SAM
               Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
    
                             GUARD
               Hold on, sonny ... let's see your
               I.D.
    
    SAM fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to
    the lobby before JILL leaves. He has forgotten he is
    wearing his new I.D. badge. The GUARD can't see it because
    JILL's dossier is covering it.
    
                              SAM
               Shit ... it's here somewhere. My
               name's Lowry, Sam Lowry - Expediting
               ... can't this wait?
    
                             GUARD
               No, sir ...
                    (getting out book of forms)
               I'm going to have to file a report on
               this. Now ... what date is it
               today?...
    
    SAM gives up trying to find his I.D. card.
    
                              SAM
                    (frantic)
               Sorry, it'll have to wait.
    
    He runs off - dropping suit - towards some stairs he has
    spotted.
    
                             GUARD
               Stop!! Come back!
    
    He starts to run after SAM. TWO OTHER GUARDS also give
    chase.
    
    
75a INT.   STAIRS                            DAY           75a
    
    SAM scrambles up the stairs. GUARDS in pursuit.
    
    
76  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            76
    
    The original GUARD rushes over to a guard desk and inserts
    key into cover of what is clearly an alarm button.
    
    
77  INT.   STAIRS                            DAY             77
    
    SAM still running.
    
    
78  INT.   LOBBY                             DAY             78
    
    JILL is still arguing with PORTER.
    
                             JILL
                    (sweetly)
               You're a stupid, fat arsed,
               obstructive, fascist moron aren't
               you?
    
                            PORTER
               If you say so.
    
                             JILL
               You think these are tits don't you?
    
                            PORTER
               Ah.
    
                             JILL
               I bet you'd like to touch them?
    
                            PORTER
               Oh.
    
                             JILL
               Well don't. You're looking at twenty
               pounds of high explosive! And if you
               don't stamp this form I'm going to
               blow the place up!
    
    JILL thumps the desk with her fist.
    
    
79  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY             79
    
    The GUARD throws the alarm switch.
    
    
80  INT.   LOBBY                             DAY            80
    
    Alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily
    armed GUARDS leap out, their guns trained on JILL as she
    appears to be the only person around.
    
                             GUARD
                    (shouting)
               DROP IT!!
    
    JILL has only the form in her hand - which she dutifully
    drops. She is terrified by the suddenness and size of the
    response to her hitting the desk. The GUARDS close in.
    
    SAM rushes out of the door leading to the stairs. He can't
    believe the sight that greets him. He responds
    instinctively,
    
                              SAM
               STOP! Let her go!
    
    He rushes over to the Porter's desk just as the GUARDS
    behind him come through the door. He doesn't have a clue
    what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of
    GUARDS they snap attention. Confused he looks around and
    then realizes his I.D. badge, is on his lapel and the
    GUARDS are responding as trained. The GUARDS chasing him
    screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to
    attention. Everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant
    to make the next move. SAM breaks the silence.
    
                              SAM
               Well done ... uh ... excellent work
               ... quick thinking. I'll take charge
               of her now ...
    
    Realising he has JILL's dossier, he shows it to everyone -
    her print-out pictures are on the front page.
    It's a classified matter ... I'll include your fine
    handling of the situation in my report
    
    SAM is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive
    toy present - he hands it to the PORTER.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing Jill)
               Come with me, please.
    
    He hustles her towards the door.
    
    
81  EXT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL BUILDING    DAY             81
    
    SAM marches JILL out of the main door and down the front
    steps of the Information Retrieval building. As he
    struggles with her some of the papers in the dossier slip
    out unbeknownst to SAM and leave a trail of litter behind
    them.
    
                             JILL
               Who are you? Let go!
    
                              SAM
               Don't look back! Act naturally!
    
                             JILL
               How can I act naturally, when you've
               trying to break my arm?
    
    CUT to the POV of the Ministry of Information front door
    GUARDS. They are looking down the steps at the retreating
    backs of SAM and JILL who are jostling each other. The
    GUARDS see JILL elbow SAM in the ribs.
    
                              SAM
                    (wincing)
               Ow! That hurt!
    
                             JILL
               Good!
    
                       VOICE FROM BEHIND
               STOP! Come back here!
    
                              SAM
               Oh, God ... no!
    
    He turns around, knowing that the game is up. But instead
    of one of the GUARDS shouting - it's an OLD LADY angrily
    glaring at him and pointing to a "Keep your city tidy"
    sign above a litter bin.
    
                           OLD LADY
                    (screaming)
               Can't you read english? You
               illiterate foreign pig! You come here
               from your own filthy country and
               think you can mess our streets up!
               You should be fried alive, you dirty
               verminous ... etc. etc.
    
    SAM sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the
    pavement. He lets go of JILL for a moment to grab at the
    papers. The LADY continues screaming at him, her little
    Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his
    bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping SAM's new trousers.
    SAM is torn between trying to regain the pages of the
    dossier and following JILL who has disappeared round the
    corner. He gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after
    JILL.
    
    CUTTING back to the TWO GUARDS, who have been observing
    all this bizarre activity, we see one of them reading one
    of the pieces of paper.
    
                          OTHER GUARD
               Hey, you shouldn't be reading that
               it's classified.
    
    
82  EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            DAY             82
    
    JILL is behind the steering wheel of her lorry which is
    just starting to move off. SAM frantically runs towards
    the lorry, leaps on the running board and pulls himself up
    into the cab.
    
    
83  INT.   LORRY CAB                         DAY            83
    
                              SAM
                    (climbing in)
               Well done, that's it ... Let's go!
               Vrmmm. Vrmmm.
    
    SAM looks up and down his side of the street anxiously
    before realizing that JILL has switched off the engine and
    is sitting glaring at him. They are stopped, right in
    front of the Ministry building.
    
                              SAM
                    (frantic)
               What are you doing? For Christ's
               sake! Get moving!
    
                             JILL
               Who are you?
    
    Desperately SAM pulls roller blind down over window.
    
                              SAM
                    (hurriedly)
               Sam Lowry. Hello. This sounds insane,
               I know, but I've been dreaming about
               you. Even before I saw you you were
               in my dreams. Weird isn't it. I mean
               ... I don't know what it means ...
               but it might mean something ...
               mightn't it? I hope so. Anyway you're
               in danger and I think we should get
               out of here, now, quick! Come on!
    
    Still JILL does nothing. SAM pulls down roller blind over.
    window.
    
                              SAM
                    (desperate)
               Bloody hell! Do as I say!
    
                             JILL
                    (hard, icy cool)
               No.
    
                              SAM
                    (beginning to lose his
                    bottle)
               Please!
    
    JILL continues to sit, glaring.
    
    SAM delves into his pockets and drags out a handful of
    I.D. cards and papers, most of which fall onto the floor.
    He then remembers that the badge he's looking for is
    pinned to his jacket. He thrusts it forward at JILL.
    
                              SAM
                    (beside himself with panic)
               Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm
               Information Retrieval Officer -
                    (he checks the number
                    somewhere. On the badge?)
               DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for -
               your own good! Now start up and get
               moving before I hand you back to
               them!
                    (indicating M.I. building)
    
                             JILL
               Them?
    
                              SAM
               Us. Them. I don't know ... just get
               going.
    
    JILL starts up and moves off, very cool, in her own time.
    By now SAM has got the shakes.
    
                             JILL
                    (indicting the papers that
                    Sam has dropped)
               Don't litter my cab!
    
                              SAM
                    (picking them up)
               Oh, sorry.
    
    
84  EXT.   CITY FREEWAY                      DAY            84
    
    A high shot of the lorry, moving through the city among
    traffic.
    
    
85  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  DAY            85
    
    JILL is preoccupied with driving. She is smoking a
    cigarette. SAM occasionally glances at her.
    
                              SAM
               ... This is amazing ... for me ...
               being here with you. I mean, in my
               dreams you ...
    
                             JILL
               I don't want to hear about your
               fucking dreams!
    
                              SAM
               Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted
               at you.
    
                             JILL
                    (mainly to herself)
               Why are they all pigs at Information
               Retrieval?
    
                              SAM
               I don't know.
                    (realizing that this
                    includes him)
               Hey, that's not a very nice thing to
               say.
    
    JILL blows smoke in SAM's direction.
    
                              SAM
                    (waving the smoke away)
               You know, smoking's bad for you.
    
                             JILL
               It's my fucking life.
    
                              SAM
                    (winding down the window)
               Yes, of course. Sorry.
    
                             JILL
                    (lighting up another
                    cigarette)
               I know you. I saw you through the
               floor, didn't I?
    
                              SAM
               Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
    
                             JILL
               I didn't run away. I left the flat.
    
                              SAM
               Why?
    
                             JILL
               I didn't like it.
    
                              SAM
               Why not?
    
                             JILL
               It had a hole in the floor. Where are
               we going?
    
                             JILL
               Where are you taking me?
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             JILL
               Where are you taking me?
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're
               taking me.
    
                             JILL
               It does doesn't it?
    
                              SAM
                    (slightly worried)
               Where are you taking me?
    
    
86  EXT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  86
    
    We PULL BACK and lift off to see that the beautiful
    countryside through which we've been travelling is in fact
    a solid wall of giant bill-boards, advertising all sorts
    of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper, sea spray
    flavored cigarettes - you name it - These advertisements
    form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels.
    From a bird's eye POV we see that the land behind the
    hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc.
    
    
87  EXT.   POWER PLANT            DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)      87
    
    The power plant is an extensive, brutal, Dante's Inferno
    of a landscape made mainly of steel ... towers, chimneys,
    huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters ... It
    is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and
    forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. In the
    murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective
    clothing and hard hats.
    
    This is the world which is now entered by JILL's lorry ...
    The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and
    JILL jumps down from the cab. SAM stays inside, looking
    around. Something catches his eye.
    
    CUT to facade of house. Window boxes with flowers and
    shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide
    domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a MAN with
    protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his
    face. He is waving to someone. Slowly the house rises out
    of frame.
    
    In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and
    a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled
    with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. It is lowered onto
    the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one
    of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of
    the power plant.
    
    
88  INT.   LORRY CAB                         DAY             88
    
    SAM watches JILL walk away from the lorry and enter the
    despatcher's hut. He looks around uneasily and then he
    start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a
    compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. He
    gets grease on sleeve of his suit. In the space behind the
    seats he finds the pieces of luggage which JILL had
    carried away from the flat. He starts to examine this
    cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the
    cab door.
    
                             JILL
               Don't act guilty. Act like me. I'm
               just getting on with my job. Or, are
               you just getting on with yours?
    
    JILL gets into the cab and closes the door and drives to a
    forward looking position.
    
                              SAM
               What's going on here?
    
                             JILL
               What does it look like ... I'm
               collecting empties.
               
    The lorry stops and JILL gets out. From SAM'S P.O.V., the
    house suspended from the crane starts moving through the
    sky towards the lorry. He glances back to see JILL slip a
    package out from behind the seat. She glances
    surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel
    inside her jacket she walks away.
    
    
89  EXT.   LORRY                             LATE AFTERNOON 89
    
    SAM climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on
    JILL. He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot
    standard. The picture on it - though faded by pollution -
    is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by
    the murk and mess of the power plant. JILL has made her
    way over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the
    corner of one of the metal structures. They appear to be
    exchanging parcels. SAM is worried by this suspicious
    behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on
    the side of the building that illustrates, almost
    identically, the action we have just seen along with the
    warning: "MIND THAT PARCEL. EAGLE EYES CAN SAVE A LIFE".
    
    CUT to the house being lowered and secured onto the lorry.
    
    
90  INT.   LORRY CAB                         LATE AFTERNOON 90
    
    JILL is starting up the lorry. SAM is glancing over her
    shoulder at the suspicious parcel which is tucked behind
    her. They move off. The last view of the power plant is of
    a group of MEN all in protective clothing and masks
    happily playing a game of volleyball.
    
    
91  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  LATER AFTERNOON91
    
                              SAM
               OK. What's in the parcel?
    
                             JILL
               What parcel?
    
    SAM nods knowingly in the direction of the parcel.
    JILL I don't know. Christmas present.
    SAM picks it up.
    
                              SAM
               It's heavy.
    
                             JILL
               A heavy Christmas present.
    
    He glances at her suspiciously.
    
                             JILL
               Open it if you don't trust me.
    
    SAM hesitates and puts the parcel down.
    
                              SAM
               I'd rather trust you.
    
    
    JILL gives him a quizzical look and smiles slightly, in
    spite of herself. She turns away so that he won't notice.
    
    
92  INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY IN CITY TRAFFIC  DUSK           92
    
                             JILL
               What are you doing in Information
               Retrieval?
    
                              SAM
               Looking for you.
    
                             JILL
               No, really.
    
                              SAM
               Really.
    
                             JILL
               I mean, it doesn't suit you.
    
                              SAM
                    (looking at his jacket)
               Suit me?
    
                             JILL
               Don't you know the sort of thing that
               Information Retrieval does?
    
                              SAM
               What do you mean? Would you rather
               have terrorists?
    
                             JILL
               We've got both.
    
                              SAM
               Things would be worse without
               Information Retrieval.
    
                             JILL
               They couldn't be worse for the
               Buttles.
    
    SAM is at a loss.
    
                             JILL
               Why don't you say, no system is
               perfect.
    
                              SAM
               Well, no system is.
    
                             JILL
               Say, all wars have innocent victims.
    
                              SAM
               Well, all wars do -
    
                             JILL
               Who is this war against, Sam?
    
                              SAM
               Well, terrorists of course.
    
                             JILL
               How many terrorists have you met?
               Actual terrorists?
    
                              SAM
               Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's
               only my first day.
    
    JILL bursts out laughing. SAM joins in. They are both
    laughing hysterically as they approach the Central
    Supplies depot.
    
    
93  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK            93
    
    The impression is that the place could be an abandoned
    airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose
    contents is arranged in a grid pattern of "streets", all
    the streets being lined by stacks, piles, ranks, jumbles
    of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily
    grouped, some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated
    houses) standing in the open others protected under simple
    areas of roofing. Each group of Assorted Supplies lies
    inside the squares of the grid of streets. The streets are
    eerily lit by lights just being switched on, and each
    square is also lit by harsh localized lighting. The effect
    is a nightmarish gigantic Aladdin's cave of black shadows
    and garishly lit mountains of stuff.
    
    
94  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK           94
    
    JILL's lorry starts down one of the "streets".
    
                             JILL
                    (as they pass a clock in
                    "C"s)
               Look at that - right on time.
    
                              SAM
               What? I thought you were free to come
               and go as you please.
    
                             JILL
               Well, almost ... unfortunately I do
               have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
    
                              SAM
                    (slightly surprised)
               Every day?
    
                              SAM
               Turn around!
    
                             JILL
               What?
    
                              SAM
               They'll be there waiting.
    
                             JILL
               Who will?
    
                              SAM
               Security.
    
                             JILL
               You're joking.
    
                              SAM
               No. Please. They're going to arrest
               you.
    
                             JILL
               I thought you arrested me.
    
                              SAM
               Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
                    (he grabs for the emergency
                    brake)
    
                             JILL
                    (pushing his hand away)
               Cut it out, Sam.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing at the steering
                    wheel)
               Will you please turn back.
    
                             JILL
                    (shoving him back)
               Get away!
    
                              SAM
                    (lunging for the steering
                    wheel)
               Turn!
    
                             JILL
                    (unable to control him)
               Stop it ... damn you!
    
    SAM throws the lorry into a gut-sucking skid.
    
    
95  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           95
    
    The lorry skids around a corner and roars down a side
    street of containers.
    
    
96  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK            96
    
    SAM and JILL are fighting for control of the lorry.
    
                             JILL
               You're mad! You're out of your mind!
    
    At that moment the air is split apart by the wail of
    sirens. SAM and JILL look back.
    
    
97  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           97
    
    From inside two strategically placed wooden containers
    stacked amongst the piles of containers marked
    "AUTOMOBILES" burst forth two Security vehicles. Wood
    flying, lights flashing, wheels smoking - they squeal away
    in pursuit.
    
    
98  INT.   LORRY                             DUSK           98
    
                              SAM
               I was right! Step on it!
    
                             JILL
               Let go! We've got to stop!
    
                              SAM
               Now you're the one that's out of your
               mind.
    
                             JILL
               Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll
               kill us!
    
    They struggle for control of the lorry.
    
    
99  EXT.   CENTRAL SUPPLIES                  DUSK           99
    
    The lorry rumbles down the street of containers lurching
    from side to side as the battle in the cab wages back and
    forth. Containers are smashed open and their contents
    spill out only to be further damaged as the pursuing
    Security vehicles crash through them. The lorry escapes
    from the streets of containers and cannons through the
    main gate and out on to the streets of the city.
    
    
100 INT.   LORRY CAB                         DUSK          100
    
    SAM and JILL are still struggling violently for control of
    the lorry. SAM is terribly inexpert as a driver but he
    behaves like someone possessed. Through the rear view
    mirrors he can see the Security vehicles catching up with
    them. He starts fumbling with he multiple gear levers.
    
                             JILL
               Don't touch those!
    
    
101 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREETS                  DUSK           101
    
    The lorry roars down a street of terraced houses and then
    screeches around a corner.
    
    
102 INT.   LORRY                             DUSK          102
    
    SAM pushes JILL's hand back and grabs for the lever that
    he thinks is overdrive. But rather than gaining speed
    there is a terrible lurch as the house and trailer
    disconnect from the cab.
    
    
103 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          103
    
    The house slides off the trailer which is skidding
    sideways and crunches to the ground just as the Security
    vehicles round the corner.
    
    
104 INT.   SECURITY VEHICLE                  DUSK          104
    
    From behind the DRIVER we can see that the house has
    settled across the roadway at right-angle to the other
    houses, making it appear to be a normal dead end street.
    So shocked is the DRIVER that he fails to stop in time and
    KABLOW!! the car smashes into the house.
    
    
105 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          105
    
    Hot on the heels of the 1st car, the 2nd vehicle skids and
    then smashes into the house which collapses and then
    explodes in flames.
    
    
106 INT.   JILL'S LORRY                      DUSK          106
    
    SAM sits paralysed with shock. The lorry has come to a
    halt. JILL is desperately trying to get him to move.
    
                             JILL
               Come on, let's go! Let's get out of
               here!
    
                              SAM
               Oh God! What have we done?
    
                             JILL
               We? Don't blame me!
    
                              SAM
               It wasn't supposed to happen like
               this.
    
                             JILL
                    (looking behind)
               Shit! The house is on fire!
    
                              SAM
               "And your children all gone."
    
                             JILL
               What?
    
                              SAM
               "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home,
               your house is on fire and your
               children all gone" ... Do you think
               anyone's hurt?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
                    (tapping him on the
                    forehead)
               Come out, I know you're in there
    
    
107 EXT.   DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          107
    
    A Security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the
    streets. We roar along with it as it rounds a corner and
    skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from
    JILL's lorry. Heavily armed SECURITY POLICE pour out and
    take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever
    other cover is available. Searchlights are played on the
    lorry. The OFFICER IN CHARGE appears with a loud-hailer.
    
                       OFFICER IN CHARGE
               Come out, we know you're in there!
               You cannot possibly escape. Throw
               your weapons from your vehicle and
               come out slowly with your hands on
               your heads. Obey my instructions and
               no harm will come to you. But if you
               force us to shoot we'll shoot to
               kill.
    
    During the above speech a SMALL BOY on a tricycle "roars"
    around a corner behind the SECURITY POLICE. He rides into
    a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and "takes
    cover" behind it. He points his toy rifle at JILL's lorry
    and takes shot. In reaction to the noise made by the kid's
    rifle the OFFICER IN CHARGE dives for cover and the
    SECURITY TROOPS open fire and pepper JILL's lorry cab with
    holes. A few of the SECURITY TROOPS then rush forward and
    fling open the cab door. The cab is empty. The OFFICER IN
    CHARGE gets to his feet and looks about. His uniform is
    covered with dust, oil and shit from the street. He just
    misses seeing the back of the BOY as he disappears round
    the corner on his tricycle.
    
    
108 INT.   LINGERIE DEPARTMENT/SHOPPING CENTRE              108
    
    To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering
    sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. As we
    slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of
    exotic occasions we come upon SAM and JILL pushing a
    shopping trolley. In the trolley is the "suspicious"
    parcel which JILL was given at the power plant.
    
                              SAM
               This is a hell of a time to buy a
               nightie.
    
                             JILL
               Are you still following me?
    
                              SAM
               Please, Jill ... I love you.
    
                             JILL
               Go away.
    
                              SAM
               There are plenty of other safe
               places. Why don't we go back to my
               flat?
    
                             JILL
               Leave me alone!
    
                              SAM
               You've got to trust me. It sounds
               silly but I know we were meant to
               meet.
    
                             JILL
               You mean you were meant to hijack my
               truck, make me crash it, and have
               every security man in town looking
               for me?
    
                              SAM
               I vas just trying to help. I decided
               to trust you. Maybe I was wrong.
               Whose side are you on really? Who are
               your friends? Who was the man who
               gave you the parcel? What's in it?
               It's the only thing you saved from
               the lorry .... It must he something
               very special.
    
                             JILL
               I saved you from the lorry and you're
               not very special.
    
                              SAM
               ........... It's a bomb isn't it?
    
                             JILL
                    (exasperated)
               Oh ... Jesus!
    
    SAM grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start
    tearing it open.
    
                              SAM
               I'm going to open it!
    
                             JILL
                    (grabbing parcel and trying
                    to take it from him)
               No you're not!
    
    They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. SAM's
    suit gets slightly ripped. Their tug-of-war is interrupted
    by a voice off camera.
    
                             VOICE
               SAM!!
    
    SAM turns to see MRS TERRAIN and SHIRLEY a short distance
    away. MRS TERRAIN is heavily bandaged and sitting in a
    wheelchair which SHIRLEY is pushing.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               It's me and Shirley!
    
    From the TERRAINS' POV SAM looks as if he is wrestling
    with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full
    length mirror. The mirror or something obscures JILL. MRS
    TERRAIN and SHIRLEY exchange puzzled looks and proceed
    toward SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets
               go of the parcel and pushes JILL
               away. She moves off.
    
                              SAM
                    (after Jill for Mrs
                    Terrain's benefit)
               I think that'll hold it.
                    (to Shirley)
               Hello Shirley. Just helping someone
               tie up a Christmas present. How are
               you?
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               My complication had a complication,
               but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up
               and bouncing about like a young
               gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas
               present for your mother?
    
                              SAM
                    (Trying to keep an eye on
                    Jill who is disappearing
                    from sight)
               Er, yes ...
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
               Shirley and I come here regularly. I
               love romantic lingerie.
    
    She unwraps a set of red and black, fur trimmed things
    with strategic holes in them.
    
                          MRS TERRAIN
                    (coyly)
               Picture me in these.
    
    At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far
    corner of the store. It is the corner that we last saw
    JILL moving towards. SAM races towards the smoke, dust
    covering his suit. He finds bras, knickers, broken shop
    dummies, bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over
    the place. On the edge of this devastated area he sees
    JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and
    plaster dust. He rushes over to her.
    
                              SAM
                           (frantic)
               Are you alright?
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                              SAM
                    (anxiety giving way to
                    anger)
               You don't deserve to be! You should
               be dead, or maimed like them .... How
               could you ...?
                    (indicating the wounded)
               What a bloody stupid thing ... I
               should. have made you open it in the
               lorry
    
    She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it
    open. Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured.
    Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys.
    She throws the parcel and its contents hard into SAM's
    chest. He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with
    the severed limbs of a shop dummy.
    
                             JILL
               There's your bomb! Our annual bribes
               for official ass-holes like you!
    
    SAM sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved. Liquor
    oozes from the broken bottle all over SAM's suit. He is at
    a loss for words.
    
    JILL's attention is attracted by moans coming from the
    badly hurt BOMB VICTIMS. She goes to help them.
    
                             JILL
                    (to Sam)
               Come on, make yourself useful, there
               are people hurt!
               
    JILL goes around trying to make the INJURED comfortable.
    SAM follows her. He takes off his jacket with his
    Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to
    make a pillow for one of these VICTIMS. By now sirens are
    wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is
    general pandemonium. SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and
    begin arresting everyone, including the DEAD and INJURED.
    ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom JILL is
    attending.
    
                             JILL
               Hey stop ... she's hurt!
    
    The GUARD gives JILL a thump in the side of the face with
    his gloved hand. SAM sees red.
    
                              SAM
               DON'T TOUCH HER!!
    
    The GUARD looks up and as he does so he is transformed
    into the GIANT WARRIOR from SAM's dream. He towers over
    the WOUNDED, the DYING and the debris of the blasted
    lingerie department. SAM grabs for a weapon and comes up
    with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. It
    makes a passable club.
    
                             JILL
               SAM .... don't!!
    
    The TWO COMBATANTS square off ... looking for an opening
    ... a chink in the other's defences - at which point SAM
    is flattened from behind by a TROOPER's gun butt.
    
    
108a       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY108a
    
    SAM is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship. He
    tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing
    descent. With a thud he hits the bottom. Stunned, bruised
    and battered he tries to get up. Standing over him are the
    GREY PRISONERS. They press forward.
    
                              SAM
                    (feebly)
               Where is she? Is she here?
    
    The GREY PRISONERS dissolve into what looks like several
    BAGGEES.
    
    
109 INT.   BLACK MARIA                       EVENING       109
    
    The BAGGEES hang from a track on the ceiling of the Black
    Maria. SAM is lying on the floor, covered by his jacket,
    with his badge prominently displayed. He is dazed and
    mumbling ... the only BAGGEE in the wagon apart from TWO
    GUARDS who have removed their helmets and are relaxing
    while travelling back to base.
    
                            GUARD A
                    (scratching his head)
               These helmets don't half make your
               scalp itch.
    
                            GUARD B
               Ooh, don't mention it.
                    (beginning to scratch his
                    head)
               And they make you sweat. Half the
               time I can't see where I'm going -
               there's a great Niagara of
               perspiration coming down.
    
                            GUARD A
               I'm lucky, I've got thick eyebrows.
               That keeps it up and channels it out
               to my ears.
    
    SAM stirs and groans
    
                            GUARD B
               Who's he?
    
                            GUARD A
               Someone from Information Retrieval
               they're always hanging about in
               lingerie.
    
    SAM is coming to his senses. He takes in the situation,
    sees all the BAGGEES and staggers to his knees.
    
                              SAM
               Jill! Jill! Are you there?!
    
    He begins rummaging through the BAGGEES. ONE of which is
    dressed as FATHER CHRISTMAS. SAM opens the "face vent" of
    the BAGGEE'S' hoods. A pair of strange eyes look out.
    
                            GUARD A
               Excuse me, sir - that's government
               property.
    
                              SAM
               Is here a girl here? Tall, fair hair,
               blue eyes?
    
                            GUARD A
               Dunno sir. They check all that at the
               depot.
    
    SAM continues fumbling about the BAGGEES.
    
                            GUARD 3
                      (pulling Sam back)
               We can't allow you to do that sir,
               it's more than our job's worth.
    
                              SAM
                    (shaking Guard off)
               I've got to find her! Jill! Jill!
    
                            GUARD A
               You can always fill in an application
               form, if you're a relative, sir.
               Please stop, sir.
    
    SAM takes no notice.
    
                              SAM
               Jill! Jill!
    
    GUARD A hits SAM, knocking him out again.
    
                            GUARD A
               Sorry about that sir. Regulations.
               We'll have you safely back in your
               office in no time.

112 INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      EVENING       112
    
    SAM recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his
    desk in his office. He is bruised and battered and has a
    black eye. His suit is torn and bloody. MR WARREN is
    gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture.
    Behind WARREN, crowding the doorway, are the PEOPLE who
    circulate around him and are the cast of the WARREN high
    energy circus. LIME is with them.
    
                            WARREN
               This is a black eye for the
               department, Lowry! ... And I don't
               care how you behaved when you were at
               Records! Information Retrieval is an
               executive branch! We're proud of our
               reputation and we protect it!
    
    One of his ACCOLYTES thrusts a paper into his hand - he
    glances at it.
    
               Damn it, Lowry, that convoy of troop
               carriers is still not accounted for
               ... I thought I told you to deal with
               it.
    
    He slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with
    other forms.
    
               And what the hell is this mess? An
               empty desk is an efficient desk.
    
    He has picked up some of the forms.
    
               Good God! ... queries from Security,
               searches from Central Banking about a
               cheque, clarification notices from
               Accounting concerning unreturned
               receipts, another demand from the
               Motor Pool.
    
                              SAM
               Mr Warren ... I have to find out
               about ...
                               
                            WARREN
               Shut up! I don't know what's going on
               here, Lowry, but don't think you can
               intimidate us with your friends and
               relatives in high places! Now shape
               up!
    
    He dumps the papers and folders onto SAM's desk and storms
    off with his ENTOURAGE, leaving a gleeful LIME in the
    doorway.
    
                              SAM
                    (grabbing Lime as he starts
                    to slip away)
               Lime, I need to use your computer
    
                             LIME
               Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.
                    (he indicates Sam's
                    smothered desk)
               You seem to have quite a lot to do
               yourself.
                    (he disappears into his
                    office)
    
    
112a       INT.                              30TH FLOOR
CORRIDOR   DAY                               112a
    
    SAM rushes out of his office after LIME. But, LIME has
    locked his door. SAM bangs on the door.
    
                              SAM
               Shit!
    
    
112b       INT.                              SAM'S OFFICE   DAY112b
    
    SAM storms back into his office. Reaching a peak of
    frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the
    pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion. Within
    seconds it returns. SAM sends it off a second time. It
    doesn't return a second time, periodically something
    passes through the tubes causing them to move. SAM's
    pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up.
    At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep
    through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it.
    There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM
    smiles. Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and
    then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside SAM's
    office door. It shakes the whole building. SAM goes to his
    door and opens it.
    
    
113 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    CONTINUATION  113
    
    Every door in the corridor has been opened by the
    occupants of the room. All the occupants stick their heads
    into the corridor, all gazing with SAM at the variously
    coloured blizzard of paper which has errupted through the
    whole length of the corridor ceiling, from which protrudes
    the intestines of the pneumatic system.
    
    
114 INT.   JACK'S OFFICE CORRIDOR & INFORMATION         EVENING114
           RETRIEVAL CORRIDORS
    
    It is the end of the working day. JACK is leaving for
    home. He is putting on his executive-styled bullet-proof
    vest and packing his "Secret Connection" briefcase. As the
    scene progresses SAM and JACK proceed out of the door and
    down he corridor, passing other I.R. OFFICIALS. SAM is
    dishevelled and causing acute sartorial embarrassment to
    JACK to is trying to distance himself from him.
    
                              SAM
               Come off it, Jack! Of course you can
               check to see if she's been arrested.
    
                             JACK
               I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole
               case has become much more complicated
               since last we talked.
    
                              SAM
                    (exasperated)
               She's innocent, Jack --- she's done
               nothing wrong.
    
                             JACK
               Tell that to the wives of the
               Security men she blew up this
               afternoon. Listen, we've also had a
               report just in from Central Services
               that Tuttle has wrecked an entire
               flat and sabotaged adjacent Central
               Services systems - as a matter of
               fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes
               open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
    
                              SAM
                    (catching up with Jack)
               You don't really think Tuttle and the
               girl are in league?
    
                             JACK
               I do. Goodbye.
                    (steps into lift)
    
    
115 INT.   LIFT                              EVENING       115
    
                              SAM
               It could all be coincidental.
    
                             JACK
               There are no coincidences, Sam.
               Everything's connected, all along the
               line. Cause and effect. That's the
               beauty of it. Our job is to trace the
               connections and reveal them.
                    (whispers)
               This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion
               was obviously planned from the
               inside. Bye bye.
    
    
116 INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY         EVENING        116
    
    JACK and SAM have just emerged from the lift. The lift
    doors close. SAM agitatedly speaks.
    
                              SAM
               Jack, she's innocent!
    
                             JACK
               Sam - we've always been close,
               haven't we?
    
                              SAM
                    (eagerly)
               Yes we have, Jack!
    
                             JACK
               Well, could you stay away from me
               until this thing blows over.
    
    
117 EXT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL       NIGHT    117
                       BUILDING
    
    SAM is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval. The
    lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street
    lamps are lit. He is exhausted and depressed and anxious
    about the safety and whereabouts of Jill. He begins to
    retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry
    front steps and around the corner to where Jill's truck
    was parked.
    
    
117a       EXT.                              JUST AROUND THE
CORNER     NIGHT                             117a
    
    SAM stands in the passageway where JILL's lorry was first
    parked. The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is
    a small splodge of oil by the kerb. SAM stands lost and
    beaten under a street light. He slumps down to the
    pavement unsure his next move. The street light is
    reflected in the pool of oil. As he stares at the
    reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue
    cloud-filled sky. SAM turns to look at the actual street
    light. It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru
    the inner wall of the great stone ship.
    
    
117b       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY117b
    
                    DREAM GIRL'S VOICE
               I'm here Sam. Don't give up.
    
    SAM is pushing thru the GREY PRISONERS. The light from the
    crack shafts across the space in which they find
    themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall. There
    in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful,
    shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone
    cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards
    them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a
    great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a
    black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round
    he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the
    floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI
    WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT.
    The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he
    raises his spear in front of himself in an almost
    religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused.
    Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round
    just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic
    WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM
    parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then
    strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has
    vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears
    something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who
    is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down.
    Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards.
    He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the
    ground.
    
    Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes
    at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM
    spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM
    rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next
    to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again
    and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he
    can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with
    his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him
    to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the
    big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground
    before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the
    wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the
    situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground.
    The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages
    to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and
    opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries
    to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds
    in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes
    from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The
    wounds continue to bleed fire.
    
    SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen
    WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire
    rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing
    that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's
    his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire
    begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable.
    SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell
    tolls.
    
    
118 EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            NIGHT         118
    
    SAM's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. He is
    staring wide-eyed. A church bell tolls in the distance.
    SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's
    got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway
    but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows,
    is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses
    direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice
    comes from behind him.
    
                             JILL
               You're late.
    
    SAM spins around. Stepping out from the shadows is JILL -
    cigarette in her mouth.
    
                              SAM
                    (stunned)
               Jill! What are you do ... I mean ...
               how did you ... Are you alright?
    
                             JILL
               Yes.
    
                              SAM
               What happened to you after ...
    
                             JILL
               Your face ... are you hurt?
    
                              SAM
               No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick
               about you ... I thought ...
    
    A patrol car approaches. Quickly SAM grabs JILL and goes
    into a kiss to explain their presence. The car hesitates
    for a moment and drives on.
    
                             JILL
                    (through kiss)
               They're gone.
    
                              SAM
                    (through kiss)
               Are you sure?
    
                             JILL
                    (through kiss)
               Yes.
    
    They resume passionate kiss. After a moment
    
                              SAM
                    (urgently)
               C'mon, we've got to get you off the
               streets.
    
    They head off clutching one another.
    
    
119 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    NIGHT          119
    
    The Elysian Fields train arrives clattering. SAM and JILL
    are the only passengers to emerge. They can't keep their
    hands off one another. This is young love at its freshest
    and most exciting. SAM looks up and down the platform
    cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train
    clatters off again into the darkness. SAM and JILL
    approach SAM's front door. He puts a key in the door and
    tries to open the door but has some difficulty. Something
    creaks. He gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens
    and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head..
    
    
120 INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT         120
    
    SAM enters, followed by JILL. His breath immediately
    starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam. The
    flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then
    deep frozen. Icicles are hanging down from everywhere. The
    flat looks like a scrap dump. Every wall has spilled out
    its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of
    the available space and making progress through the flat
    difficult. Half a dozen MEN are at work. They are
    impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing
    and look more like spacemen. Their voices however belong
    to SPOOR and DOWSER.
    
                              SAM
               For God's sake, what's happened?
    
                             SPOOR
               Thermostat's gone. And then some.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... And then some.
    
                              SAM
               What have you done to my flat?
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign here, please.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... ere please.
    
    SPOOR offers a clipboard and pencil. He bangs the
    clipboard against the furniture to knock the ice off it.
    
                              SAM
               What is it?
    
                             SPOOR
               It's a 27B/6 of course.
    
                            DOWSER
               ...B/6 of course.
    
                             JILL
                    (to Dowser)
               Do you repeat everying?
    
                            DOWSER
                    (nods)
               ... Everything.
    
                             SPOOR
                    (indicating the mess)
               This is what you get when you have
               cowboys round yer ducts.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... yer ducts.
    
                             SPOOR
               I think you've got your T41 crystal
               inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin-
               threaded-solenoid-control. It's
               either that or a new washer.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... new washer.
    
                             SPOOR
               Sign the form so we can get to it.
    
                            DOWSER
               ... get to it.
    
    SAM grabs the clipboard and smashes it over SPOOR's head.
    The board is so cold that it snaps in two. The paper on it
    also snaps in two.
    
    
121 INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    NIGHT         121
    
    SAM pulls JILL out into the corridor.
    
                             JILL
               Don't you like parties?
    
                              SAM
               C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
    
    As SAM and JILL begin to move down the corridor they see a
    cigarette glow brightly in a dark recess.
    
                             JILL
                    (seeing cigarette light)
               TOO LATE!
    
    They ere about to run when TUTTLE steps out of the
    shadows.
    
                            TUTTLE
               I'll fix the damage when they've
               gone. I'll be ready for you tomorrow.
    
    
122 INT.   MOTHER'S CORRIDOR                 NIGHT         122
    
    A venerable PORTER carrying a single key on a large ring
    is preceding SAM and JILL along the corridor which we have
    seen before. The PORTER's name is MATTHEWS.
    
                              SAM
               My mother said it would be all right.
    
                           MATTHEWS
               She didn't say anything about it to
               me.
    
                              SAM
               Well, she's my mother, not yours.
    
                           MATTHEWS
               I won't be held responsible.
    
                              SAM
               How long will she he away?
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (darkly)
               There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's
               clinic who never come back at all.
    
    MATTHEWS unlocks MOTHER's door.
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (to Jill)
               You're not a professional, are you?
    
                             JILL
               No, amateur.
    
                              SAM
                    (firmly)
               Thank you, Matthews.
    
    With which he ushers JILL through the door and closes the
    door in MATTHEWS' face.
    
    
123 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          123
    
                              SAM
               Make yourself at home. Don't answer
               the phone or open he door to anyone.
               I won't be long.
    
                             JILL
               Where are you going?
    
                              SAM
               I'm going to pull some strings. It's
               our only hope.
    
                             JILL
               Don't do anything silly.
    
                              SAM
               Thanks for the vote of confidence.
    
                             JILL
               Take care.
    
    SAM goes.
    
    
124 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOYER       NIGHT          124
    
    SAM arrives at the Ministry of Information Retrieval
    reception It's late. GROUPS OF CLEANERS are operating
    cleaning machinery. SAM approaches the DESK PORTER who is
    playing with the executive toy SAM gave him.
    
                              SAM
               Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me
               through to Mr Helpmann's office?
    
                            PORTER
               I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to
               go through the proper channels.
    
                              SAM
               And you can't tell me what the proper
               channels are, because that's
               classified information?
    
                            PORTER
               I'm glad to see the Ministry's
               continuing its tradition of
               recruiting the brightest and best,
               sir.
    
                              SAM
               Thank you, Dawson.
    
    SAM crosses the foyer, checks to see that Dawson is no
    longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive
    toy, and slips past the lift which, at that moment,
    disgorges a leg-bandaged, be-crutched LIME who hobbles
    across the lobby without seeing SAM, who slips down the
    stairs which he knows lead to Helpmann's private lift.
    
    
125 INT.   BASEMENT                          NIGHT         125
    
    SAM creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding
    a GROUP OF SECURITY MEN who are singing carols in close
    harmony. ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction.
    They are all incredibly big and brutal looking.
    
                         CHOIR MASTER
                    (stopping them)
               No, no, no, Arthur, you're going flat
               on that G. It's your breathing. Take
               a breath on the end. of the previous
               line, after Noel. Right, one, two,
               three.
    
    The CHOIR begins singing again. SAM reaches the lift and
    looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall.
    CLOSE UP of SAM's face concentrating. He hears, we hear, a
    reprise of MR HELPMANN talking to SAM in MOTHER's
    bathroom.
    
                        HELPMANN (V/O)
               Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
               but we were close friends, and I keep
               his name alive at the office every
               day. It's as though he's there
               speaking to me. "'ere I am, J.H."
    
    SAM is already typing the letters EREIAMJH into the
    keyboard. The lift judders and star s to ascend.
    
    
126 INT.   MR HELPMANN'S OFFICE              NIGHT         126
    
    SAM steps out of lift into an ante-room. No-one is there.
    Tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the
    office. No reply. He slowly opens door.
    
    
                              SAM
               Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?
    
    The office is empty. SAM looks around - not sure what he
    wants to do. He notices his MOTHER's picture on HELPMANN's
    desk. He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by
    an elaborate computer console in a side room. It
    occasionally chatters away. Paper print-outs fill a large
    bin. Hesitantly SAM approaches it. Looking around to make
    sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the
    machine lights up.
    
    He cautiously pushes a couple more keys. The teleprinter
    machines have paused but one starts chattering now. He
    looks at the one which is busy. A CLOSE UP shows us the
    message coming through: TOTAL - TOTAL -TOTAL - CAR 15
    REQUEST FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE
    TROLLOPE - VAGRANT - DETAINED TERRORIST/SUSPECT/ASSOCIATE.
    This is followed by a code number. The teleprinter falls
    silent.
    
    SAM returns to the keyboard and switches it off. He turns
    to leave.
    The teleprinter starts chattering again. SAM stops and
    goes back to it and looks at the page again. A CLOSE UP
    shows us: UPDATE - SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED - CAUSE OF
    DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST. PLEASE DELETE FROM SPECIAL
    CATEGORY. The computer spool revolves back and forth for
    two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for
    a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches
    on the machine. He has he answer.
    
    
127 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          127
    
    SAM enters the flat. JILL is nowhere to be seen. The
    lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door
    beams a shaft of bright light. Music pours forth ... it is
    "BRAZIL".
    
                              SAM
                    (cautiously)
               Jill?
    
    Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through.
    There is JILL but, transformed. She is wearing one of
    SAM's MOTHER's wigs which billows in the air blown by a
    fan. She is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed
    from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. She
    looks like the DREAM GIRL. SAM stands open-mouthed. JILL
    notices him and smiles.
    
                             JILL
               What do you think? ... is it me?
    
                              SAM
                    (still stunned)
               You don't exist any more. I've killed
               you. Jill Layton is dead.
    
    He holds out a print-out. She reads it and slowly looks
    up.
    
                             JILL
               Care for a bit of necrophilia?
    
    They rush together.
    
    
128 INT.   STONE SHIP                        ANTI-DAY      128
    
    The screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing
    about a beautiful blue sky. They course this way and that.
    Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a
    mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns.
    The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as
    SAM sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light.
    He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day.
    far below him the GREY PRISONERS gather beaming with
    happiness. Diving back to the ground - SAM unsheaths his
    sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of
    the great columns. The FORCES OF DARKNESS who have been
    lurking in the shadows slink back. SAM, with one mighty
    swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as
    cracks begin to race up and through the column. It is
    disintegrating. As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to
    topple. Everyone steps back. Down it plummets. And smashes
    into a million pieces. The bright blue sky escapes in all
    directions. The GREY PRISONERS' iron collars and chains
    fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a
    beautiful blue sky. They look up to the sun. SAM is
    exultant.
    
    
129 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  DAWN          129
    
    Pull back from the sun through a window. The light falls
    on SAM's smiling sleeping face. Showly he wakes. He little
    by little remembers where he is and reaches over for JILL.
    She isn't there. Sam panics.
    
                             JILL
               Merry Xmas.
    
    She is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him. She
    crawls over to him - they start to embrace.
    
                              SAM
               Everything is going to be all right.
    
    But crash !!! it's a raid! Like a giant drill a whirling
    cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of
    Mother's bedroom, and we now see what made the neat hole
    in the BUTTLE ceiling ... CUTS show doors being burst open
    by SECURITY TROOPS. JILL and SAM are frozen in panic.
    SECURITY TROOPS are sliding down a fireman's pole" from
    the hole in the ceiling.
    
                              SAM
                    (shouts)
               She's dead. Check the list!
    
    But it is SAM they have come for. He is being dragged out
    of the bed.
    
                            GUARDS
                    (as they struggle with him)
               You Turncoat Bastard! JUDAS!!
               TRAITOR!!
    
    A canvas bag is plunged over his head. All goes black.
    
                              SAM
                    (muffled)
               JILL!!!
    
    A shot rings out. JILL screams. It echoes through the
    blackness.
    
    
130 INT.   PROCESSING AREA                                 130
    
    In absolute inky darkness, SAM and the CAMERA move through
    space and time marked only by voices and sounds
    encountered on the way. This sound-sequence fades in and
    out a few times, indicating that the journey is longer
    than the real-time period of the blacked-out sequence. We
    hear:
    
    Footsteps of SAM and GUARDS.
    
    Distant howl of pain.
    
    Muzak.
    
    Iron gate.
    
    Footsteps again.
    
    Lift doors opening and closing.

               chemist for some antibiotics and
               bathroom scales and there's enough
               left on the voucher for a

    What looks like a rectangular hatch in the blackness
    opens. It is the eyeslit on the front of SAM's bag being
    opened by a SECURITY GUARD.
    
    The SECURITY GUARD peers in for a moment and then steps
    back to reveal two SMART OFFICIALS sitting at a desk. They
    are looking up at SAM/us.

               Right. Next!
    
    The SECURITY GUARD appears briefly and zips up the hood
    again plunging us back into darkness. We get more muffled
    shouts, heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere.
    
    Another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap on SAM's hood. We
    see another TWO OFFICIALS.
    
                              SAM
                    (more hysterical)
               Where's Jill? What's happened to
               Jill?
    
                          OFFICIAL C
               93/HKS/608, you've got quite a list
               of misdemeanours here, haven't you?
               All this is going to take time and
               money, and I'm afraid, according to
               your bank statement and credit rating
               here, you're likely to be in deep
               financial trouble by the end of it.
               Now, either you plead guilty to say,
               seven or eight of these charges,
               which'll bring the costs down to
               within your reach, or you can borrow
               a sum to be negotiated, from us, at
               very competitive rates. We can offer
               you something at say, eleven and a
               half per cent, over thirty years. But
               you will have to buy insurance to
               qualify for his scheme.
    
                          OFFICIAL D
               All you have to do is to agree to
               sign the appropriate boxes on these
               forms. Yes or no?
    
                              SAM
               I'm not guilty! Not guilty you stupid
               bastar...
    
    THE GUARD closes the flap. Once again darkness and
    confusion. until another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap
    again to reveal another TWO OFFICIALS.
    
                          OFFICIAL E
                    (examining forms)
               Now, since you've elected to plead
               not guilty on all these charges,
               you'd be well advised to take some
               sort of insurance cover. Preferably
               comprehensive, or if you'd prefer,
               something more specific - say,
               against electrical charges over
               f70.00. And for food and
               accommodation costs of say, £800.00.
               Detention can be a very expensive
               business.
    
                          OFFICIAL F
               Now, before we bore you with the
               small print perhaps you'd like to
               tell us whether you'd like to sign
               this insurance acceptance form or
               not. Think carefully before you
               decide. Thinking ahead in financial
               matters is always the wise course.
    
    The flap is closed and opened again very quickly - NEW
    OFFICIALS are revealed. This process repeats again and
    again - getting faster and faster. The OFFICIALS' faces
    seem to become a changing blur. Their voices overlap in a
    growing cacophony. The desk and the other items in the
    room remain static. To add to this disturbing effect the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS begin to gather in the room behind the
    OFFICIALS. As they increase in number they begin to press
    forward unseen by the OFFICIALS. Soon they fill the view
    through the flap.

131 INT.   STONE SHIP                        TIMELESS      131
    
    CUT to SAM struggling with the FORCES OF DARKNESS. He is
    overwhelmed by the black hordes. They fill the screen. SAM
    disappears under their onslaught. A pause. Then SAM is
    raised, spread-eagled, above the black sea of the FORCES.
    Strong hands hold him. The maniacal laughter starts up.
    SAM is turned in its direction.
    
    CUT to a shot over the top of the mass of robed FIGURES.
    Rising from the ruins of the stone columns, the black
    cloth thing flaps menacingly towards camera. We can see
    the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the Storeroom
    of Knowledge in the background.
    
    SAM looks terrified. As the thing hovers above SAM in all
    its huge twisting awfulness, it slowly begine to unfold
    like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion.
    
    SAM freezes as the interior becomes invisible. There in
    the billowing blackness is the GIRL. She is beckoning.
    
                             GIRL
               Sam.
    
    But the VOICE is no longer the mysterious feminine voice
    of before - it is the voice of the maniacal laughter.
    
    SAM struggles with the restraining hands. He twists and
    turns, but to no avail. From the darkness above him
    descends the JOLLY GENT looking just like MR HELPMANN) on
    his window washer's platform. However he is now dressed as
    Father Christmas.

    The filing cabinets of the Storeroom of Knowledge dissolve
    squares of padding that form the walls of a cell. The
    laughter echoes round the cell. SAM sees that MR HELPMANN,
    in his wheelchair is watching him. He is dressed as Father
    Christmas. They are alone in the cell. SAM scrunches up
    into the corner.
    
                           HELPMANN

               you feel. So I brought you a bottle
               of barley water.

               I'm afraid she's upped stumps and
               retired to the pavilion.

               seems she was killed resisting
               arrest.
    
                              SAM
                    (relieved)
               No, no ... I did that...
    
    HELPMANN looks surprised. SAM shuts up.
    
                           HELPMANN
               The odd thing is it appears to have
               happened twice ... a bit of a
               disputed call, I'm afraid.
    
    SAM has gone catatonic.
    
                           HELPMANN
                    (starting to go)
               So, there you are. All I can say is,
               don't fall at the last fence. The
               finishing post's in sight. See you in
               the paddock. Good luck. Keep your eye
               on the ball. Got to go .... Can't
               keep the orphans waiting.
    
    HELPMANN goes. A GUARD helps him out and then returns with
    ANOTHER to help put the restraining bag over SAM.
    
                             GUARD
               Don't fight it, son .... confess
               quickly ... Before they get into the
               expensive procedures. If you hold out
               too long you could jeopardise your
               credit rating.
    
    The bag blacks everything out.
    
    
133 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM                      133
    
    The bag comes off. SAM finds himself strapped into an
    Information Retrieval chair. The CAMERA tracks back
    frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an
    unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of
    sight.
    
    The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange
    light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total
    disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately
    trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain
    tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments.
    Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at
    hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions
    near the distant door they hand over documents to the
    white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.
    
                             GUARD
               11/AFT/607, sir.
    
    They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains
    after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then
    proceed to the door and take up positions on either side
    of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see
    he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS.
    A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching
    him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the
    I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway.
    After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the
    impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the
    GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep
    breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more
    briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and
    fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is
    covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he
    blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto
    the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.
    
                              SAM
               Jack?
    
    The I.R. OFFICER reacts to this as if he's been hit in the
    solar plexus, and he tries to disguise it by simulating a
    coughing fit. He then picks up a nasty looking implement
    and advances on SAM.
    
                              SAM
               Jack?... Jack?
    
                             JACK
                    (hysterically from behind
                    mask)
               Shut up!
    
                              SAM
               Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
    
                             JACK
               Bastard!!!
    
                              SAM
               This is all a mistake. Jack, please
               take that mask off.
    
    JACK is very close to SAM, he is shaking. He lifts up his
    mask to reveal sweaty face, contorted with fear and anger.
    
                             JACK
               You stupid bastard!
    
                              SAM
               What?
    
                             JACK
               How could you do this to me?
    
                              SAM
               Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
    
                             JACK
               How do you think I feel? You shit!
    
                              SAM
               Jack ...
    
                             JACK
                    (pulling down mask)
               Shut up! This is a professional
               relationship!
    
    JACK comes at SAM with the horrifying implement.
    
                              SAM
               JACK!! ... You can't ... No, don't!
    
    SAM's eyes widen in terror. From his POV we look up at
    JACK approaching. The ceiling above and behind JACK is
    suddenly and. loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole
    Machine, and in an instant without benefit of "fireman's
    pole", the commando-like figure of MR TUTTLE gun in hand,
    leaps through the hole.
    TUTTLE is immediately followed by similar looking MEN with
    balaclavas, guerilla-type clothing, and very efficient
    guns. JACK is cut down. So are the TWO GUARDS who have
    opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into
    the room.
    
    TUTTLE raps out into a walkie-talkie
    
                            TUTTLE
               Detonate!
    
    From somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion
    which rocks the room. TUTTLE is already unstrapping SAM.
    
                            TUTTLE
               Let's go!
    
    
134 INT.   CORRIDORS                         NIGHT         134
    
    CUT to RESCUERS, with SAM in the middle, fighting their
    way in the terrific battle with GUARDS, until they get to
    a door leading to the stairs.
    
    
135 INT.   ENDLESS STAIRWAYS                 NIGHT         135
    
    CUT to RESCUERS, their members thinning, and SAM, fighting
    down flight after flight of stairs with lots of neat-oh
    violence and blood and, gunshots and ... falling and
    bleeding and -
    
    
136 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY       NIGHT          136
    
    CUT to the RESCUERS fighting their way to the entrance.
    Another group of RESCUERS at the door are providing cover
    fire The PORTER sits behind his desk watching the battle
    on his bank of monitors.
    
                           2ND GROUP
    
               Quick! We've only got thirty seconds
               to get clear!
    
    TUTTLE tosses SAM a dark overcoat to cover his light grey
    detainee outfit. Together, the TWO GROUPS burst out
    through the door into the large empty forecourt.
    
    
137 EXT.   FORECOURT                         NIGHT          137
    
    The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights.
    Machine gun installations open fire. The RESCUERS are
    totally exposed.
    
    They are cut down left and right.
    Desperately they battle their way across the open space.
    Time running out. SAM, knowing the way, leads TUTTLE
    towards a shielded spot. Will they make it? As the last
    RESCUER is cut down SAM and TUTTLE dive for cover.
    KOWBLAMMPOW! A massive explosion. Then another. And
    another. SECURITY TROOPS caught unprotected are decimated.
    SAM looks up. Christ! The building is being blown to bits.
    Certain windows are lit. They spell out MERRY XMAS. With a
    final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser
    of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of T.V. consoles and
    visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, MR
    HELPMANN's masterpiece. But also tons and tons of paper.
    
    Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected
    its load skywards. The night sky is full of white
    rectangular wisps. Ashlike they flutter down over the
    city. SAM looks around and can't see TUTTLE anywhere. He
    shouts for him. But the remaining TROOPS have spotted SAM
    and SAM runs.
    
    
138 EXT.   CITY PASSAGES                     NIGHT         138
    
    SAM runs madly through paper-littered passages
    
    
139 EXT.   SHOPPING                          PRECINCT     NIGHT139
    
    Eluding his pursuers, SAM dives into a crowded, garishly
    lit, shopping centre. Once among the protective company of
    he mindlessly shopping MOB, SAM slows down and proceeds
    casually. The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business
    paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them.
    Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way
    towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking
    against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds
    across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his
    foot. He tries shaking it off.
    
    It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the
    piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other
    leg. He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the
    flying debris. Another hits him and twists around his arm.
    Still more paper blows against him. He is having
    difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he
    tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him.
    He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe
    what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business,
    apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from
    ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley -
    and watches it career down the steps of the shopping
    precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon
    of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about
    on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from
    his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE.
    The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind
    carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile.
    But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few
    pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there
    with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he
    is suddenly very visible. All the shopping bustle has
    stopped. They are all staring at him. SAM spots TROOPS
    shouldering their way towards him. He turns tail and
    dashes off.
    
    
140 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT         140
    
    The drawing room door burst open as SAM dashes in. SAM
    goes straight through and into the bedroom. The room is
    empty of all terrestrial human life forms. A hollow wind
    blows the curtains.
    
    
141 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  NIGHT         141
    
    The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling).
    SAM turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway. He rushes
    forwards.
    
    
142 INT. MOTHER'S FRONT DOOR NIGHT 142
    
    But it's MATTHEWS the porter who is at the door watching
    SAM running towards him.
    
                           MATTHEWS
                    (piously)
               A sad loss. Your mother was with her
               at the end. The doctor said there was
               no pain.
    
    SAM grabs MATTHEWS round the neck and shakes him.
    
                              SAM
               Where is she?
    
    
143 EXT    A CORNER                          NIGHT         143
    
    SAM comes running around corner. He is suddenly bathed in
    a strange blue light. He halts and looks up. There
    opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance
    to a chapel of dully modernistic design. Holy music from
    an electric organ can be heard. SAM rushes up the stops
    and through the door.
    
    
144 INT. CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER NIGHT 144
    
    CUT to SAM slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and
    suddenly being confronted by SPIRO the Maitre D.
    
                             SPIRO
               Ah, yes, Mr Lowry. It's so good you
               could make it. Right this way.
    
    SAM, dumbfounded, follows.
    
    CUT to SAM being lead into the middle of the cold, modern
    chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted
    up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit
    theatrical. A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some
    sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a VICAR stands
    in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in
    stepped seats on three sides of the room.
    
    The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped
    the lid. Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large,
    rather idealized, colour portrait of MRS TERRAIN looking
    not so much young as beautiful. Among the MOURNERS are DRS
    JAFFE and CHAPMAN and others in their operating gowns.
    
    
    To enlarge on the scene, we see SHIRLEY T snuffling in her
    hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the
    VICAR standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it,
    etc. CUT to SAM trying to take all this in, stopping in
    the middle of the room. Don't forget DR CHAPMAN sobbing.
    
                             SPIRO
                    (stopping and looking back
                    at Sam)
               Mrs Lowry? Mrs Lowry is ...
    
    In the background the VICAR begins speaking, and we hear
    his voice throughout the following action. CUT TO SAM'S
    POV ....
    
                     VICAR (in background)
               At these times of giving and
               receiving let's remember the greatest
               gift of all: not a gift to be
               spurned, not a gift to be opened and
               carelessly set on one side, not a
               gift to be taken back and changed,
               but the gift of eternal life. Mrs
               Terrain has just received that most
               wonderful of all gifts. She came to
               us physically new, she goes hence
               from us not so physically new. But
               the spirit never grows old. And in
               the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs
               Terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy
               forever.
    
    ..... (CUT to SAM's POV) ... past SPIRO to a section in
    the bleachers directly across from the coffin and the
    VICAR where a WOMAN (her back to SAM) is surrounded by a
    buzzing flock of very handsome and well-dressed YOUNG MEN.
    
                              SAM
                    (trying to take in scene)
               what? ... Oh ...
                    (starts to follow Spiro)
    
                             SPIRO
                    (coming up to back of
                    woman)
               Madam ...
    CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It
    is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years
    younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
    
                            MOTHER
               Sam!!!
                    (uncertainty in her
                    expression)
    
                              SAM
                    (staring dumbly, not
                    knowing what to say)
               Mother? ... What ... what's ...
               you've got to help me ...
    
                            MOTHER
                    (embarrassed, unsure)
               Not now ... please
    
                         YOUNG GALLANT
                    (belligerently)
               Ida, is this fellow bothering you?
                    (getting up)
               I'll -
    
    But before we can find out what he'll:
    
                             SFX:
               TERRIFIC CRASH.
    
    CUT to entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come
    crashing in. PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The
    TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads
    for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes
    against the coffin which topples over spilling its
    contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his
    mouth and dashes through the door.
    
    
145 EXT.   MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES           NIGHT          145
    
    CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things,
    hurting himself, getting up running.
    He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path
    seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams.
    The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes
    deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top
    shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing
    FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The
    maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and
    right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.
    Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there
    is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead
    end.
    At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from
    the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair
    dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through
    this pile.
    
    
    Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He
    scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS,
    TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape.
    He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He
    actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to
    face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand
    touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The
    knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through
    it.
    
    
146 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT         146
    
    SAM finds himself in a strange little house empty of
    furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed
    frame. He tries to lock the door behind him but there is
    no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it
    shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit
    but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet
    uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully.
    He looks around but there is only one window and it is
    shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-
    
    SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.
    
    
147 EXT.   CITY                              NIGHT         147
    
    JILL's truck, with the house on its back, is driving
    dangerously through he streets. It lurches round the
    corner.
    
    
148 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT          148
    
    - The lurch throws SAM to one side. He picks himself up,
    and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the
    shuttered window which is at the front end of the house,
    in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and
    finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He
    sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing
    JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs
    on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so
    that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He
    sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him.
    SAM sobs with relief and love.
    
    
149 EXT.   THE ROAD                          NIGHT         149
    
    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches then breasts
    the rise beyond which lies ... looking more than ever ...
    JILL'S VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a MIX ...
    
    
150 INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  NIGHT         150
    
    Through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead.
    The reverse shot shows us JILL driving and SAM next to
    her. They glance at each other.
    
    
151 EXT.   SMALL ROAD                        EARLY MORNING 151
    
    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches and then
    breasts the rise beyond which lies ... A STUNNINGLY
    BEAUTIFUL UNTOUCHED VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a
    MIX ...
    
    
152 EXT.   BEAUTIFUL VALLEY                  DAY           152
    
    Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with
    the house on its back. Creepers and wild roses have grown
    up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke
    rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to
    one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck
    has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a
    vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some
    chickens. JILL appears locking like CRUSOE carrying a
    basket of eggs.
    
    
153 INT.   HOUSE                             MORNING       153
    
    SAM is in the bed, just waking up. He opens his eyes,
    locking calm. Off screen we hear the door opening.
    
                       JILL (off screen)
               Morning. Sleep well?
    
    SAM nods his head slightly, on the pillow.
    
                              SAM
                    (quietly)
               I don't dream anymore.
                    (he embraces her)
    
    
154 EXT.   HOUSE AND GARDEN                  MORNING       154
    
    A high shot. Everything in the garden is definitely
    lovely. The music tells us. The music swells and the
    camera slowly pulls back, and back. It's a happy ending.
    And then, in the foreground, TWO HUGE HEADS appear looking
    straight at the camera. It is MR HELPMANN and JACK. They
    both shake their heads.
    
                          MR HELPMANN
               He's got away from us, Jack.
    
    CUT to their POV.
    
155 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM        DAY            155
    
    Sam is sitting in the IR chair. He is strapped in. His
    eyes are open but miles away. His face is wreathed in a
    benign and very happy smile.
    
                             JACK
               I'm afraid you're right, Mr.
               Helpmann. He's gone.
    
    A wide shot of the room shows us HELPMANN and LINT turn
    away and leave. SAM is left alone. He is humming.. The
    camera pulls back and back. The Information Retrieval room
    with SAM in it floats away into the most beautiful
    glorious sky ever.
    
    SAM's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ......
    
    
               "Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June,
               We stood beneath an amber moon,
               And softly murmured 'Some day soon'
               We kissed and clung together,
               Then, tomorrow was another day.
               The morning found me miles away,
               With still a million things to say,
               Now, when twilight beams the sky above,
               Recalling thrills of our love,
               There's one thing I'm certain of,
               Return, I will,
               To old Brazil."

    THE END
The Cell

 


	FADE IN:

	A SPECK OF DUST

	Grains of sand dance in the wind.  As we glide over a VAST
	DESERT, the speck of dust becomes a HORSE AND RIDER. 
	CATHERINE YOUNG straddles the beautiful black animal, her
	mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon.  A curious breeze
	blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if
	the wind itself were telling something to her...

	Catherine sees a FLICKERING LIGHT in the sand.  She pulls the
	reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into
	nothingness.  She dismounts, affectionately scratches the
	horse's neck, and follows the LIGHT.  When she looks over her
	shoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. 
	Not surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand
	sliding beneath her feet...

	She finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed,
	gnarled limbs appear to form hands.  The light dances across
	her face.  She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source...

	A SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a
	locket and chain.  It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy
	of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes.  He sits
	on a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival.

				CATHERINE
		Thanks for the horse.

	He's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine.

				EDWARD
		You liked him?

				CATHERINE
		He's beautiful...

	Edward smiles, delighted he made her happy.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		But I thought we were going sailing.

	The boy frowns.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		You promised.

	A devilish glint in his eye, Edward redirects the mirror. 
	Catherine follows the flicker to a TOY BOAT in the sand.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		We can't fit into that!

	Edward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her,
	then snaps the locket shut.  When her vision clears,
	Catherine sees a GIANT SHIP perched among the dunes.  A craft
	weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		That'll do.

	She walks toward it, but Edward doesn't follow.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
			(coaxing him)
		Come on, Mister E.

	She extends her hand, but he adamantly shakes his head no.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What now?

				EDWARD
			(nods at the ship)
		's broken.

	Undaunted, she... finds herself standing on the DECK.

				CATHERINE
			(calling to him)
		Who says?

				EDWARD
		Mocky-Lock.

				CATHERINE
		Oh no... No you don't.

				EDWARD
		"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock
		wants me where I am."

				CATHERINE
		I bet we can fix it.

	She opens a rusted iron DOOR.  It makes an HORRIFIC
	SCREECHING SOUND.  Similar to metal-on-metal, but more
	piercing, more pained.  As if made by a living thing.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
			(familiar with the noise, a
			warning to him)
		Ed-ward...

	The boy's FACE CONTORTS, turning into something half-human,
	half-animal.  A monster.  Mocky-Lock.  He SCREECHES, trying
	to frighten Catherine, but she cocks her head...

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		We agreed.  No more Mocky-Lock.

	The creature sticks its tongue out and DIVES.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Edward!

	But it's too late!  Edward/Mocky Lock slithers into the sand
	and disappears.  Resigning herself to a failure, she opens
	the palm of her left hand, revealing a SMALL BUMP in the
	flesh between thumb and forefinger.  She presses hard and...

	PICTURE AND SOUND DISTORT AND CHANGE

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	We are looking at a large SCREEN showing an electronically
	generated three-dimensional view of a human brain featuring
	color-coded neurological activity.  In a specific section of
	the image, cells flash from yellow to red...

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL HENRY WEST surrounded by computers,
	monitors, electronics, and keyboards.  DR. MIRIAM KENT stands
	before a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and
	images.  Both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip
	assemblers.  The impressive, weird computer system HUMS as it
	shifts programs, the unusual brain image changing colors.  

	THROUGH A LARGE WINDOW, we see into an ADJOINING ROOM within
	which a HUMAN FIGURE hangs suspended in mid-air by a series
	of cables designed to simulate flotation.

	AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of
	the touch-sensitive screen, changing the complex CHEMICAL
	SYMBOLS displayed there.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, a series of pharmaceuticals are
	injected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleeve/arm of
	the figure.  A featherweight cloth MASK electronically rises,
	revealing the sleeping face of Catherine.

	AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam hits a button and speaks into an
	intercom microphone.

				MIRIAM
		Sing a song of sixpence...

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, there is no reaction from Catherine.

				MIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Sing a song of sixpence...

				CATHERINE
			(hoarse, groggy)
		A pocketful of rye...

				MIRIAM (O.S.)
		Four-and-twenty blackbirds.

	Catherine's eyes open.

				CATHERINE
		Baked in a pie...

	IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Henry hits a switch and Catherine is
	lowered to the pedestal.  Miriam checks Monitors displaying
	Catherine's vital signs and continuing what must be a
	routine, presses numbers on a keypad to open the PRESSURIZED
	AIRTIGHT DOOR separating the two areas.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, lights come on and Miriam eases
	Catherine out of the apparatus.  She checks her pupil
	dilation, pulse, throat, and reflexes.  She pokes and prods
	with a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside
	observer, but is nothing to them.  Getting to her feet, we
	see that Catherine's BODYSUIT is made of an unusual dark
	fabric almost liquid in consistency.

	AT THE CONSOLE, Henry moves to another section and for the
	first time, we see there are two elaborate neural monitors. 
	And the "brain" pictured here is smaller.  Younger...

				HENRY
		"Mister E." is doing fine.

	REVEAL A SECOND FIGURE suspended from the ceiling in the
	PROCEDURE ROOM.  A SMALL BOY is lowered to the pedestal and
	as Miriam records data, Catherine removes the child's "mask,"
	displaying the haunted face of Edward.  Clearly, the boy is
	in some kind of catatonic state.

				MIRIAM
		Did we go sailing?

				CATHERINE
		Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.

				MIRIAM
		"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock
		wants me where I am."

				CATHERINE
		Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.

	Henry communicates with them via the intercom.

				HENRY
		Where did that come from again?

	Catherine looks annoyed - How could he forget?

				CATHERINE
		A nursery rhyme.

	Catherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body
	into a waiting wheelchair.  Miriam takes a penlight and
	examines the boy's eyes... An emotionless void, oddly
	beautiful.

				MIRIAM
			(thinking aloud)
		Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the
		bogeyman... All preparation for the
		horrors of the real world.

	Making certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him
	with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him
	into the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam.  Henry types in
	a command and moves to join them.

				HENRY
		Anybody hungry?  I'm hungry...

	A BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN... A constantly
	fretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them
	in the corridor.

				COOPERMAN
		Edward's parents are here.

	We can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news.

	EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

	Situated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego,
	California, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini
	compound.  A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A
	DIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY

	Although this is a hospital room filled with medical
	equipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys,
	posters, photographs, and drawings to make it more "homey." 
	(Some hint at aspects of Edward's fantasy world).  Every
	comfort has been provided and no expense spared.

	Henry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual
	clothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman.  Sitting
	on the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dressed
	woman in her mid-40's.  There is a soulfulness to her, but
	the husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor
	of a corporate tycoon.  One might write him off as cold, but
	we sense a genuine love for his wife and child.  Ella smiles
	and caresses Edward's hair.

				ELLA
		He needs a haircut.

				CATHERINE
		I'll tell the nurse.
			(sensing something in Edward)
		God, he loves when you visit.

				ELLA
		My husband wonders if that's true.
			(delivering bad news)
		He wants to place Edward in a hospital.

	Seeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate
	himself from Miriam and Catherine...

				HENRY
		There are other applications for the
		scanner, Mr. Baines...

				LUCIEN
		I realize that, Henry...
			(to Miriam)
		And I know your work, Dr. Kent, is
		invaluable to this company...

				CATHERINE
		You don't know about me, though, do you?

				LUCIEN
		Catherine, we've waited eighteen months
		for signs of progress...

				CATHERINE
		There's been progress.

				LUCIEN
		Yes, but there is no proof the procedure
		works.  All I have is a belief that your
		interaction with my son is not a
		hallucination.

	Catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the
	intensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must
	defend herself.

				CATHERINE
			(to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry)
		You picked me, remember?  And I took the
		job.  Gladly.  This is the next wave and
		I want to be part of it...

				COOPERMAN
		No one is doubting your ability.

				CATHERINE
		Then what is it?

	Introspective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then:

				LUCIEN
		I've invested millions of dollars in
		this study... And I've convinced others
		to do the same.  I suppose I should feel
		responsible to them, but I don't.  I
		could care less if they see a profit. 
		I'm responsible to my boy, that's all
		that matters.
			(looks her in the eye)
		You tell me... Am I doing the right
		thing?

	OFF CATHERINE'S FACE...

	INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

	At first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. 
	It's too bright, the space confining.  As our eyes adjust, we
	seem to be in a bathroom or shower stall.  We HEAR a WOMAN
	CRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY.  Dark circles
	beneath eyes red and puffy from crying.  Hair wet and ratted. 
	Sweater and pants damp and stained.  Barefoot, she shivers
	from cold and fear...

	PULL BACK to show more of her surroundings.  The white-tiled
	10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push
	button SPIGOT for drinking water.  Two walls are SOLID, the
	other two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic.

	The floor is littered with empty food wrappers - candy bars,
	juice boxes.  In the center of the floor is a DRAIN and above
	her, on the ceiling, a FLUORESCENT LAMP, also encased in
	clear plastic.

	There is no door.

	A mechanism CLICKS. Then a RUMBLING... Anne seems to know
	what's coming.  She presses against the wall, removes her
	arms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and
	raises the garment over her head, forming a tent.

	WATER ERUPTS from the shower head.  There is no steam, so
	this water must be cold.  Shaking, Anne whispers a count to
	herself - "One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three..." and
	so on.  The spray hits everything in the room - mirror,
	toilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain.

				ANNE
		Thirty.

	She peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped,
	and that isn't what she expected.  We hear a soft SUCKING
	NOISE and a CLICK.  The wrapper rises on a puddle of water. 
	Anne POUNDS her fist on the wall.

				ANNE (CONT'D)
			(angry, scared)
		THIRTY!

	A puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has
	somehow been sealed shut.  Her panic intensifies as we hear
	another CLICK and the water pressure increases.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	In the darkened procedure room, Miriam finds Catherine
	standing between the two suspension devices, alone.

				MIRIAM
		You okay?

	Catherine turns, nods, and tries to smile.  Has she been
	crying?  Miriam steps further into the room.

				CATHERINE
		He hates me.

				MIRIAM
		Lucien Baines?

	Catherine nods.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I wouldn't say "hates."  Dislikes,
		distrusts, maybe.

	Catherine laughs.  Exactly what Miriam wanted.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		She adores you.

				CATHERINE
		She thinks I can bring Edward back.

				MIRIAM
		Someday you can.  We all believe that...

	Catherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere,
	focused on the two apparatuses.

				CATHERINE
		I want to try it.  Please.

	Miriam knows what this is about.

				MIRIAM
		We've been over this a dozen times.  No.

				CATHERINE
		Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What
		harm could it do?

				MIRIAM
		I don't want to find out.

	Ever the doctor, Miriam finds herself surreptitiously
	examining Catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in
	her fingertips.

				CATHERINE
		Why is it taking so long for us to reach
		him?  Because we've been reactive,
		that's why.  And we need to be active.

	Miriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
			(annoyed)
		Miriam...

				MIRIAM
		Shush.

	As Miriam examines her, Catherine continues:

				CATHERINE
		He creates the obstacles, he decides
		which games to play.

				MIRIAM
		I've heard this argument before.  It's
		not happening.

				CATHERINE
			(frustrated)
		It could take years for me to get past
		the barriers he's created.

				MIRIAM
		If we reverse the feed and bring Edward
		into your mind, it could be devastating
		for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly
		existing in a whole other world.

				CATHERINE
		I do it all the time!

				MIRIAM
		Yes, but, you're a willing participant. 
		Picture Edward in a strange place, lost,
		frightened...

				CATHERINE
		I'd be there for him.

				MIRIAM
		And he might blame you for terrifying
		him.  That one moment could erase all
		you've accomplished.  And if that
		happened, the trust he has in you is
		gone.

				CATHERINE
			(defeated)
		Okay, okay...

	Miriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes.

				MIRIAM
		Besides, I don't know what it might do
		to you.  You're already exhausted.
			(concerned)
		Have you been sleeping?

	Catherine nods.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I can prescribe something...

	Catherine shakes her head no.  Miriam shuts off the penlight
	and looks at Catherine with professional and personal
	concern.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		You're sure?  Any more nightmares?

				CATHERINE
			(defensively)
		No.

				MIRIAM
		Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. 
		You're going to eat well, meditate,
		exercise, and watch mindless television.

				CATHERINE
		Yes mother.

				MIRIAM
		I don't want you up all night reading
		Edward's case file of the nine millionth
		time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. 
		Leave the work here.

	She taps Catherine's head.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Don't bring it home in this.

				CATHERINE
		Okay.

	Miriam gathers her belongings.

				MIRIAM
		Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese
		place he's wild about.  Want to come?

				CATHERINE
			(declining)
		I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I
		want to get to bed early.

				MIRIAM
		That's my girl.

	Miriam exits, but Catherine remains, still curious what could
	happen if things were reversed.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - HALLWAY - DAY

	The corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.  At
	the NURSES STATION, a staff member observes the child on a
	closed-circuit monitor.  Further down the hall, Miriam and
	Henry exit.  Wearing a (chic) thrift store coat and lugging a
	worn book bag, Catherine stands outside Edward's room,
	watching him sleep.

				CATHERINE
		Pleasant dreams, Mister E.

	EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

	A GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch
	of two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the
	speed limit.  He signals and exits...

	EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	The truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy, unpaved road. 
	The area is desolate, depressing, and deserted.  It feels
	like no one's been anywhere near here for years.  The pick-up
	stops at a RUSTED GATE and the DRIVER, a tall, lean, sinewy
	fellow undoes a combination lock-and-chain.  We do not yet
	see his face.

	EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY

	The truck parks inside a charred barn, now hidden from view,
	and the driver steps out, followed by his DOG.

	A magnificent WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD.  We notice a GLINT in
	its BLUE EYES - the animal's an albino.  The driver points
	and whistles.  Well-trained, the Shepard sprints to the gate
	and waits, keeping a watchful eye on the road.

	INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	From the outside, a passerby would never know this sanctuary
	existed.  Within the foundation of a farm building never
	completed, we find a small room in the center of a much
	larger space.  The cell.  We hear the WHIR of ELECTRONIC
	EQUIPMENT and notice VIDEO CAMERAS mounted on tripods pointed
	at the two-way glass.  We follow CABLES to a massive VIDEO
	RECORDER - the type used in surveillance, able to record for
	days without maintenance, and an elaborate TIMING DEVICE
	connected to a series of VALVES and SWITCHES.

	As if in a beatific trance, the driver moves to the window
	and gently rests his palm on the glass.  ANNE MOVES!  Arms
	flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread.  The last
	spark of life... The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.

	Almost shamefully, he turns and hides, unable to look at her. 
	Suddenly, his body tenses and writhes, as if seized by
	torturous pain.  He opens his mouth in a silent scream.

	And then, quickly as it came, the pain subsides.  Hidden in
	shadow, he breathes deeply, regaining self-control.  He
	waits, then moves back to the glass.  Anne's dead face floats
	past him.  Almost angelic.  He watches her and leans his head
	against the window, closer.  And the driver catches his own
	reflection in the mirror.

	Meet CARL STARGHER.

	EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Small and isolated, the nearest neighbor a block away.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The place is a mess.  Computer print-outs, dirty dishes,
	unopened mail, videotapes, and notepads cover tables, chairs
	and floor.  On the crammed bookshelves, psychology texts sit
	next to volumes on mythology, religion, and the occult. 
	Totems, figurines and artifacts (Central and South American
	in origin) adorn the walls and tables.

	As Portishead plays on the stereo, we find Catherine
	suffering from insomnia, wearing goofy-yet-hip eyeglasses,
	sweatpants and a UCSD T-shirt, sharing a late-night snack
	with her pet CAT.  She shuts the refrigerator door and we
	linger on an odd POSTCARD taped to the surface.  A kitschy
	postcard of a warrior/goddess.

	INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

	We MOVE out of shadow, toward a bright focused light,
	following the albino German Shepherd - VALENTINE - as it
	enters a VAST SUBTERRANEAN ROOM.  Most of the walls have been
	knocked down, leaving only thick support posts.  Valentine
	finds Stargher in a DUGOUT PIT - about five feet deeper than
	the rest of the room - polishing a stainless steel table.  A
	bright tungsten work light hangs above, and near it is the
	chain, cables and hooks of a customized MECHANICAL HOIST.

	The dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far
	corner where there are empty jugs of BLEACH sitting next to a
	long, deep cast iron TUB.  Stargher WHISTLES and Valentine
	obediently retreats to a KENNEL CAGE.  Stargher gives him a
	chew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub.

	Soaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey. 
	The interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and
	the whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is
	floating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are
	her eyes.  Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into
	something ghostly, they are unforgettable.

	As the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne
	from the tub and carries her to the table.  He places her
	face up and dries her with a clean white towel.  He moves her
	limbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then
	retreats into shadow.  In the harsh light, against the shiny
	table, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and
	we almost expect her to move...

	We HEAR Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the
	pool of light.  Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is
	laced with some rough tatoos.  When he turns his back to us,
	we find EIGHT METAL RINGS, thick and strong, PIERCED through
	his flesh.  Two columns of four on either side of the spine,
	running from shoulder blade to just below the waist.  What in
	God's name are they for?

	Stargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where
	he keeps TELEVISION MONITORS and VCRs.  He inserts a
	videocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches
	the screen.

	In BLACK AND WHITE, we see Anne awaken in the cell.  Her
	first moments inside.  Disoriented, terrified, trapped, she
	examines her surroundings.

	Stargher is mesmerized by her fear.  Fast-forwarding to her
	death, he presses a remote and we get SOUND.  Anne screaming,
	begging for her life.  Aroused, stimulated, Stargher drinks
	it in like a symphony.  Valentine cowers in the back of his
	cage, hating this.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Lying on her bed (a waterbed), Catherine sleepily stares at
	the ceiling, rolls onto her side, and feels herself drawn
	into the comforter.  The folds of the fabric become ripples. 
	Ripples become dunes.

	EXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY

	And we find ourselves in the DESERT of EDWARD'S WORLD.

	We fly over dunes and come up behind Catherine as she
	struggles through waves of sand.  The tree trunk is up ahead
	and we glimpse someone hiding inside.

	Catherine reaches.  MOCKEY-LOCK ERUPTS FROM WITHIN THE TREE
	TRUNK!  SNARLING!  Catherine retreats, silently screaming.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN

	IN HER OWN BED, Catherine's eyes are open.  In sharp contrast
	to a typical reaction to a nightmare, she remains calm.  No
	sweaty face, no gasp, no reaction at all, really.  She might
	as well have been dreaming of puppy dogs.  Wide awake, her
	eyes return their gaze to the ceiling.

				CATHERINE
		Go.  To.  Sleep.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

	CHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. 
	Admiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings
	in his back.  He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters,
	a series of GEARS click into motion.  The sound is torturous
	as the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground,
	pulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising.  Stargher
	grimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it.  As the
	hoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the
	table until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's.

	In the flickering weird light of the television screen,
	Stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of
	William Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an
	innocent angel.  With his free hand, he touches himself,
	chains clinking and swaying.

	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

	A railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek
	bed.  Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER,
	CRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI.  A SEDAN travels down a
	service road and stops nearby.  TWO MEN exit, identify
	themselves as FBI and move to the crime scene.

	Special Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself
	on professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. 
	Special Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges,
	introspective, and intense.  A loner who marches to the tune
	of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with
	probing eyes.  He moves slowly, observing the scene - the
	world, for that matter - from a unique perspective.

	As Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak
	oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the
	air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.

				RAMSEY
		Who found her?

	Cole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car.

				COLE
		Surveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six
		this morning.

	Novak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by
	wire.  Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI
	PATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE "TEDDY" LEE, a polite, dapper
	southern gentleman.

				NOVAK
		Thanks for waiting, Teddy.

	Teddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - "My
	pleasure."  Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER
	and assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick
	clear plastic.  As the photographer reacts to a strong smell,
	Teddy comments.

				TEDDY LEE
		Bleach.

	As the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them.  Sadly,
	Novak recognizes the face.

				NOVAK
		Anne Marie Vicksey.

	We recognize her, too.

				COLE
		She the one from Santa Cruz?

				NOVAK
		Just graduated law school.  Single mom. 
		Had a two-year-old daughter.

	He and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither
	man surprised.  Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the
	killer's tell-tale signs.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
			(instructing the photographer)
		The semen on her legs and abdomen.

	FLASH! Photos are taken.

				TEDDY LEE
		Someone looking after her little girl?

				NOVAK
		Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.

	Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying
	to imagine the horrors she beheld.  He moves to the creek and
	sees only a few inches of water.  His eyes move from the drop
	site to the highway above.

				TEDDY LEE
		The poor thing.

	FLASH!  We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the
	photographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft
	shoulder.  Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene,
	steps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the
	killer's truck as it disappeared into the night.
	
	
	
	EXT. OFFICE PLAZA - DAY

	 A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN, JULIA HICKSON, shares lunch with her
	fiancee, JOHN TRACY.  They talk, laugh and kiss, not a care
	in the world.

	INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

	As TALK RADIO plays, Carl Stargher watches them, specifically
	Julia, his eyes never off her for too long as his hands work
	on something banal but unseen.

				TALK RADIO HOST
		...complaining about government
		subsidies for farmers...

	The voice on the radio becomes DISTORTED as we hear it
	through Stargher's ears...

				TALK RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
		...but without subsidies, families will
		starve, and I'm nodd
		exagggeerrrrr....ayding.  Iff id werrrr
		up tooooo meeeee.....

	The host's voice fades into a guttural, monstrous groan.

				TALK RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
		Meeeee gawwwwwdd Caaaarrrrlll.  Mee god
		cum...
			(returning to normal)
		Meeeee....wwuuuuuddunnnnttttt... be
		spending billions on other countries
		when we've got problems right here.

	He opens his eyes and watches John kiss Julia goodbye as she
	returns to work.  Stargher looks down and we see what he's
	been working on - A TOY DOLL.  Female.  Stripped of its
	clothes, a single metal ring stuck through its plastic neck.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	His lunch finished, Ramsey is on a cell-phone talking to his
	wife.  Chain-drinking coffee, Novak scrutinizes photos of the
	tire tracks.

				RAMSEY
		Well, honey, what's worse?  Doing it
		yourself or asking your mother for help?
			(gets his answer)
		Can it wait 'til I get back/
			(listens, answers)
		I have no idea, Jeannie.

	Novak checks his watch and the street.  Clearly waiting for
	someone or something.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		Well all right.  Good luck with the
		Monster.  I love you too.  Bye-bye.

	Ramsey snaps shut the cell-phone.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		We call Jeannie's mother "The Monster"
		because, well... she just is.

	Novak is oblivious, pouring over tire-related info.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		I know you could care less about my
		personal life, Peter, but I do
		appreciate the occasional, "How's your
		wife, Gordon?"

	He waits.  Novak obliges:

				NOVAK
		How is she?

				RAMSEY
		Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.

	Novak is distracted by Teddy Lee entering the diner.

				NOVAK
		Here he is.

				RAMSEY
		Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner
		tells you his wife's gonna have a baby,
		and all you care about is a coroner's
		report!

	Ramsey assesses the exhausted, lonely, intense man sitting
	across from him.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		I feel for those girls too, Pete.  And
		their families.  But it's just a job. 
		Someday it'll be over.  And then what'll
		you have?

	Much to Novak's appreciation, Teddy Lee's arrival provides an
	escape from answering the question.

				TEDDY LEE
		Hot off the presses.

	He gives them copies of the AUTOPSY REPORT and FORENSIC
	ANALYSIS of Anne Marie Vicksey.  The WAITRESS sees Teddy,
	approaches, and offers a menu.

				TEDDY LEE (CONT'D)
			(doesn't need it)
		Chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes,
		garden salad with Thousand Island
		dressing and an iced-tea.  Thank you
		darlin'.

	She nods and moves to the kitchen.  Novak and Ramsey flip
	through the documents.

				TEDDY LEE (CONT'D)
		Water in her lungs.  Same brand of
		bleach.  Match on the semen.  Lots of
		hair.

				RAMSEY
			(unenthused)
		More hair.  I could knit this guy a
		toupee.

	Novak finds something in the report that catches him by
	surprise.  He double-checks and shows the item to Teddy.

				TEDDY LEE
			(reading)
		So?

				NOVAK
		Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.

	Ramsey checks his copy.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		I need it.

				TEDDY LEE
		Now?

				NOVAK
		Now.

	INT. FORENSIC LABORATORY - DAY

	A MONITOR shows a SINGLE HAIR under a video microscope. 
	Teddy Lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view.

				TEDDY LEE
		Complete absence of melanin.

	Novak and Ramsey stand over his shoulder.

				RAMSEY
		And that means?

	Teddy moves aside and takes another bite of his lunch
	(chicken fried steak now carry-out).

				NOVAK
		The dog's an albino.
			(pictures it)
		He'd love an animal like that.

				TEDDY LEE
		Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is
		rare indeed.

	INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

	Exiting an elevator, Julia heads for her little Toyota. 
	Smart girl that she is, her eyes scan the area and her
	fingers hold a can of mace.

	INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT

	Julia climbs in, checks her mirror and backs up.  WHAM!  Did
	she hit something??  She brakes, puts the car in park, and
	checks her sideview mirror.

	Reflected there is a WOUNDED DOG.  A white German Shepherd. 
	She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing
	whimpering.

				JULIA
		Oh no...

	INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

	Julia exits her car and kneels next to Valentine, who appears
	to be in terrible pain.

				JULIA
		God... I didn't see you.

	STARGHER'S HANDS COME AT HER FROM BEHIND!  One grabs her hair
	and the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. 
	He presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move.  After a
	brief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her
	until she passes out.  Stargher pushes Julia into the
	passenger seat and starts the car.  Pulls a dog treat from
	his pocket and WHISTLES.  The Shepherd instantly perks up. 
	Perfectly healthy.  And jumps into the car.

				STARGHER
			(feeds him a treat)
		Good boy.

	INT. RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

	In a BRIEFING ROOM we find Teddy Lee, Ramsey, Cole and local
	cops.  All in need of caffeine.  They complain, gossip, and
	shoot the shit.  Resembling a demanding professor, Novak
	enters and through presence alone, lacking any self
	consciousness about his dishevelled appearance, takes control
	of the room by holding up a PHOTOGRAPH of a young woman.

				NOVAK
		Donna Krozin.
			(a new picture every time)
		Helen Francis, Teresa Manicki...

	The chatter dies.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Antoinette Simms, Natalie Pagels, Grace
		Cassatt... Anne Vicksey.

	Every person is solemn and focused.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Smart, gentle, attractive young women. 
		Just starting out in life. 
		Embarking on careers, going to school,
		getting married...

	He's hooked them.  The victims, these women, now mean
	something to them.  With great effect, he holds up grisly
	post-mortem photos.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		They were killed.  Kidnapped, tortured,
		and murdered.  By a white male.  About
		30-years old.
			(significantly)
		Who owns an albino dog./

	Everyone knows this is a real clue and awareness is
	heightened.  Ramsey chimes in.

				RAMSEY
		A purebred German Shepherd.

	Novak shows them a picture of a WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD taken
	from a resource on the Internet.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		Breeders typically destroy albino pups,
		so this animal is truly unique.

				NOVAK
		Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. 
		Forensics found dog hair in her car, but
		they had a K-9 unit at the scene and
		never had it checked.

				TEDDY LEE
		The Phoenix office tested that hair
		thirty minutes ago.  And we got the
		match.

				NOVAK
		It's his dog.

	Ramsey holds up a thick list.

				RAMSEY
		Registered breeders of German Shepherds.

	The list is long and a few of the cops GROAN.  Novak silences
	them with a fierce look that says, "I will not rest until
	this man is found and neither should you."

				NOVAK
		Be thorough, but be fast.  This guy's
		accelerating. 
		He only waited six days this last time. 
		When he started, two months could pass.

	A DESK SEARGENT enters the room and hands a FAX to Ramsey. 
	Novak is curious about it, but continues.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		This can mean different things.  He
		thinks we're stupid and can't catch him. 
		He's having fun and needs more.  Or...
			(thinking it through)
		This dog hair thing is sloppy.  The body
		this morning was found in less than
		three inches of water.  He knew we'd
		find her.  He wants to be caught.  But
		if we can't stop him...

	Gravely concerned, Ramsey moves across the room.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
			(dreading what's on that fax)
		...he can't stop himself.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

	Stargher, the awful PAIN eating away at his skull.  He
	searches the medicine chest.

				DISTORTED VOICE
		Me god feed on pain.

	The VOICE echoing inside his skull.

				DISTORTED VOICE (CONT'D)
		Pain good.  Cumm home to meee...

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

	Struggling to stay on his feet, he moves to the KITCHEN. 
	Valentine paces nervously, whimpering concern.  Stargher
	reaches for a bottle of vodka but falls to the floor. 
	Valentine BARKS, but gets no reaction from master.  We MOVE
	IN on Stargher's unblinking eyes.

				DISTORTED VOICE
		Go sleep Carl.  Me god wake up now.

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Julia Hickson finds the snack foods, drinking spigot, toilet,
	shower, and drain.  Her bare feet try to adjust to the tile
	floor, but it's fucking cold.  She glimpses herself in the
	mirror and is startled by what she sees - a terrified girl.

	INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

	A TAN SEDAN sits in the driveway of this modest middle-class
	home.  A VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR sits nearby, a deputy
	keeping watch.

	INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

	A distraught middle-aged couple, MR. AND MRS. HICKSON, sit on
	the couch of their living room.  FAMILY PHOTOS show them with
	Julia, whose fiancee, John, does his best to comfort the
	mother.  Novak and Ramsey have the unfortunate task of
	interviewing them about their daughter's disappearance.

				RAMSEY
		She was still living at home?

				MR. HICKSON
		Yes, sir.

				JOHN
		We were looking at apartments.

				MR. HICKSON
			(important they know)
		But nobody was moving in together 'til
		after the wedding.

	Novak hasn't said much.  Instead, he looks at something in
	his hands - a plastic evidence bag containing the TOY DOLL.

				RAMSEY
		John, you came to pick her up when?

				JOHN
		Eight o'clock.  We were going out for my
		birthday.

				MR. HICKSON
		Maybe you made a mistake.  Maybe she...
		she...

	Novak hides the doll.

				RAMSEY
		No sir.  I'm sorry.

	Ramsey's cell-phone rings and he excuses himself to a corner
	of the room, leaving Novak alone to deal with this
	uncomfortable, sad situation, no one saying a word until an
	emotionally shattered Mrs. Hickson, fingering a rosary, feels
	compelled to tell him.

				NOVAK
		After three years she remembers what the
		guy drove?

				RAMSEY
		She remembers because it was her "dream
		truck."  Wanted one just like it.

	EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - DAY

	Ramsey and Novak exit a small jet and are met by FBI Agent
	STOCKWELL.

				STOCKWELL
		Ramsey, Novak?

	They nod and he directs them to a waiting GMC SUBURBAN.

				STOCKWELL (CONT'D)
		Agent Stockwell.

				NOVAK
		Where is he?

				STOCKWELL
		Edison.  Just east of Loma Park.  SWAT's
		had the house under surveillance for
		about twenty minutes.
			(info memorized)
		Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher.  No
		registered weapons, no priors.  Got a
		license for his dog, though.  Named him
		Valentine...

	INT. GMC SUBURBAN - DAY

	Stockwell is behind the wheel, racing down the highway. 
	Ramsey's in the passenger seat, Novak in back.  Shotguns and
	body armor line the cargo area.  Novak's eyes target the FAX,
	a copy of Stargher's license and registration, and the grainy
	dot-matrix image of the suspect's face.  And Novak knows he's
	found him.

				NOVAK
		You're the bad man, aren't you, Carl?

	EXT. STARGHER HOUSE/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	A sparsely populated lower-middle class neighborhood.  A half
	dozen plain houses at the end of a cul-de-sac.  Bare trees. 
	Brown lawns.  Crows in the air.

	The house furthest from the main road has a white Ford F250
	pick-up in the driveway.  Green trim.

	THE SUBURBAN, hidden from Stargher's house, four-wheels it
	through a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a
	PRESCHOOL, where two more Suburbans and a van already wait.

	INT. PRESCHOOL - DAY

	Stockwell introduces Ramsey and Novak to BROCK, leader of the
	FBI Tactical Unit, a calm, confident ex-Marine wearing a
	black uniform and body armor.

				BROCK
		Glad you could make it.  We lose the sun
		in half an hour.

	Novak and Ramsey join him at the shaded window to observe
	Stargher's house.  Children's drawings fill the wall.  As
	Brock explains, Novak checks with binoculars.

				BROCK (CONT'D)
		Perimeter's two-hundred yards around the
		house.  Three men at the rear, two on
		each side, four up front.  I've got two
		marksmen on the roof.

				NOVAK
		Have they seen him?

				BROCK
		No.  There's been movement in the
		kitchen.  But it could be the dog.
			(important)
		You think she's in there?

	Novak is careful with his answer.

				NOVAK
		We proceed assuming she is.

				RAMSEY
		Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him
		he's got company.

				NOVAK
		No.
			(to Brock)
		Can you get a man close?

	EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

	Quiet.  Calm.  And then we catch a glimpse of a FIGURE
	advancing, using any cover he can, until he is right outside
	the house.  The sneaky SWAT team member, ERICSON, whispers
	into his throat mic.

				ERICSON
		I'm at the back door.

				BROCK (V.O.)
			(in Ericson's earpiece)
		Check the kitchen.

	Ericson maneuvers his way to the kitchen window and uses a
	MIRROR to sneak a peek.  In the REFLECTION we see a
	motionless man lying on the floor.

				ERICSON
		I have a man down.  Repeat, man down.

				BROCK (V.O.)
		Stargher?

	Ericson chances a quick visual check and pops his head up
	before reporting.

				ERICSON
		Can't see his face.

	INT. PRESCHOOL - DAY

	Brock looks to Novak, urgency and tension mounting.  Novak
	knows how much is riding on this specific moment.  All the
	various outcomes.  And decides.

				NOVAK
		Go.

	EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

	The SWAT TEAM SWARMS towards the house.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

	ERICSON KICKS IN THE BACK DOOR.  GUN READY!

				ERICSON
		FBI!

	He and THREE OTHERS rush inside!

	BAM!  FOUR MEN KICK in and proceed through the FRONT DOOR!

				SWAT TEAM MEMBER
		FBI!

	An odd quiet is all they encounter.  IN THE BACK, Ericson
	moves through a LAUNDRY ROOM and finds VALENTINE hiding
	behind a pile of dirty clothes, frightened by these masked
	figures in black.

				ERICSON
			(into throat mic)
		I've got the dog!

	He points for someone to secure the animal and MOVES into the
	KITCHEN, aiming his gun at the man on the floor, finally
	getting a look at his face.

				ERICSON (CONT'D)
			(recognizing him)
		Carl Stargher!  Do not move!

	No problem there.  Stargher appears lifeless.  As various
	SWAT team members secure the house, Ericson removes his mask
	and CUFFS Stargher, startled at the sight of the horrible
	RINGS piercing his back.

				ERICSON (CONT'D)
		Jesus Christ...

	EXT. PRESCHOOL/STARGHER'S HOUSE - DAY

	As an AMBULANCE emerges from a hiding place behind another
	garage, we FOLLOW NOVAK and RAMSEY as they run from the
	preschool into the house.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE

	As a K-9 UNIT secures Valentine, Novak storms into the
	kitchen, checks Stargher for a pulse and barks at SWAT>

				NOVAK
		Paramedics.  NOW.

	Ramsey pushes through and Novak informs him.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		He's alive.

	EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

	FBI AGENTS and local police cordon off the area.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

	Valentine is muzzled and led away as the PARAMEDICS load
	Stargher onto a stretcher.  Agent Stockwell turns to a
	worried Novak.

				STOCKWELL
		They'll take him to County General. 
		Reid's already there.

				NOVAK
		Make sure he stays cuffed.  Two men on
		him at all times.  I don't want anyone
		treating him but Reid.  Not so much as a
		thermometer up his ass.  Understand?

	Stockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside.  A stoic
	Ramsey enters from the living room and Novak can see the
	disappointment in his eyes.

				RAMSEY
		She's not here.

	Novak would give anything for that not to be true.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
			(it gets worse)
		You should come downstairs.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

	Ramsey leads Novak into Stargher's "workroom."  It's all
	here, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach.  An odd,
	grisly collection of DOLLS fills cubby holes in a wooden
	storage/shelf unit.  Novak's eyes are like a camera,
	documenting and storing as much information as possible, but
	it's overwhelming.

	He moves through the basement.  Careful not to touch
	anything.  He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks
	situated over the stainless steel table.  (NOTE: ON THE
	WINCH'S MOTOR IS A WORN PLAQUE READING "CARVER INDUSTRIAL
	EQUIPMENT" with a logo).

	Ramsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills
	with images of Anne dying in the cell.

	Novak is painfully, tragically drawn to this.  Although he's
	seen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed
	by the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly
	dying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia
	Hickson unless he finds her.

	INT. THE CELL - NIGHT

	CLICK.  WATER SPRAYS FROM THE SHOWER.  Caught by surprise,
	Julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut
	off valve.  Of course, there is none.  Thirty seconds later,
	the water stops.  Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's
	eyes dart around her "cage."  What kind of hell is this? 
	Shivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply
	into it.  Something's odd about the glass.  Is someone
	watching her?  She bangs on it with her fist.

				JULIA
		Hey!

	POUND, POUND, POUND!

				JULIA (CONT'D)
		LET ME OUT!!!

	But there's no response.  Only her reflection.

	INT. KERN COUNTY HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

	A HUMAN EYE.  No movement, no deviation of the iris.  A fixed
	stare.  The catatonic Stargher lies in a hospital bed, wrists
	cuffed to the frame.  An IV feeds him fluids and monitors
	report his vital signs.  As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO
	POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.  Novak, Ramsey
	and Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by DR.
	MILTON REID, a brilliant forensic M.D. currently shining an
	opthalmoscope into Stargher's eyes.  He pulls away and checks
	the ELECTROENCENPHELOGRAM already on a lightbox.

				REID
		Minimal activity in the dorsolateral
		prefrontal cortex.  And here, the
		anterior cingulate cortex.
			(to Novak and Ramsey)
		It's what helps distinguish between
		external and internal stimuli.

				RAMSEY
		What the hell does that mean?

				TEDDY LEE
			(answering for Reid)
		He's schizophrenic.

	Novak doesn't like this.  Not one bit.

				RAMSEY
		What're you doing here, Reid?  Paving
		the way for his insanity defense?

				REID
		No need.  There won't be a trial.  This
		is no act.  The coma is real.

				RAMSEY
		Whoa.  Wait a minute.

				REID
		You ever hear of Whalen's Infraction?

	Clearly not.

				REID (CONT'D)
			(re: the EEG)
		In any schizophrenic, these areas would
		be affected.  But in someone with
		Whalen's, they're hit hard and hit fast.

	Novak's worry intensifies.

				REID (CONT'D)
		Stargher's neurological system was
		infected by a virus in utero.  It lay
		dormant.  In his case for about...
			(guesses at Stargher's age)
		...thirty years.  Most likely, he's
		exhibited symptoms for awhile now, but
		the infraction - the breach - didn't
		occur 'til today.  You never know when
		it'll happen, at what age, or why.  The
		triggers vary, but the results don't.
			(fascinated by Stargher)
		He has no ties to reality.  No awareness
		of this world or the people in it.

				TEDDY LEE
		What about Thorazine? Or... Desoxyn?

				REID
		The normal psychotropics don't work. 
		He's not just catatonic, he's...
		disappeared.  Like having a dream and
		never waking up.

				NOVAK
		This girl.  Julia Hickson.  Only he
		knows where she is.

				REID
		Then I'm sorry.  For her and for you.

	Novak is past angry.  He's bordering on devastation.  Ramsey
	attempts to placate him.

				RAMSEY
		We'll go back to his house, Pete. 
		There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the
		videos, track sales of the bleach, go
		through his records.  Maybe he owns
		property somewhere.

				NOVAK
		They're in that fucking thing for forty
		hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia
		at seven-thirty last night.  You know
		what time it is now...?!

	Ramsey backs off, knowing his partner is on the verge of
	really losing it.  Reid thinks perhaps he shouldn't, but
	sensitive to Novak's pain and anger, mentions it anyway - if
	only to keep his friend from true hopelessness.

				REID
		Peter?  This is a longshot.  I mean a
		real long shot.  You're gonna think I'm
		crazy...

	EXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY

	The ship's engine ROARS TO LIFE and the PROPELLER spins
	through sand.

				CATHERINE (O.S.)
		It's fixed!

	AT THE TREE TRUNK, Catherine extends her hand and suddenly
	Edward is there, quite close, reaching out.  Catherine's hand
	trembles.  The boy is startled.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
			(surprised, to herself)
		I'm not signalling...

	Her hand tenses and shakes uncontrollably.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Sing a song of sixpence...

				CATHERINE
			(angry, to the heavens)
		I'm not signalling!

	Edward is frightened by what's happening and runs away. 
	Catherine tries to call out, but her throat constricts,
	making speech difficult.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I'm not...
			
			
			
			INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	Catherine's face is covered by a cloth floating down from the
	sky.  The sky is replaced by the ceiling and overhead lights
	of the LABORATORY, but Miriam's face remains constant.  Now
	conscious, Catherine finds herself in the lab at the Campbell
	Center, the suspension device lowering.

				MIRIAM
			(on intercom)
		Sing a song of sixpence.

				CATHERINE
			(hoarse)
		A pocketful of fucking rye.
			(worried)
		What's wrong?

				MIRIAM
			(cagey)
		Nothing.

				CATHERINE
			(disappointed)
		Why did we stop?

	Cooperman appears in the window and explains.

				COOPERMAN
			(on intercom)
		I asked them to.
			(with gravity)
		We have a situation.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	A SMALL TV SCREEN shows footage of Anne drowning in the cell. 
	Catherine, Cooperman, Henry, and Miriam watch with curiosity,
	disgust, pity.  Novak and Ramsey flank the portable
	monitor/VCR, knowing this is a disturbing but powerful tool. 
	There's someone else in the room.  John Tracy.  He cannot
	watch the video, not again.  Catherine glances at him,
	uncomfortable with his presence.

				MIRIAM
		When did he lapse into the coma?

				NOVAK
		Sometime yesterday morning.

	John tries to keep his composure, but Novak's making this
	tough for him.  Novak wants the scientists to see, to
	understand the boy's pain.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Each tape is the same.  He provides
		food, drinking water, a toilet. 
		Periodically, a shower starts.  It's on
		some kind of timer - he's clever with
		machines, building things.  I think he
		wants them to believe this is a simple
		kidnapping.  That there's a possibility
		of rescue.  Of survival.  But it's just
		a form of torture.  At the end of the
		fortieth hour, the drain shuts.  The
		water starts and doesn't stop.
			(gravely)
		We've already lost more than a day.  If
		she isn't found tonight.  She dies like
		the rest.

				COOPERMAN
			(to Miriam, Henry and
			Catherine)
		John and Ella Baines - as well as the
		Sunerset Board of Directors - have given
		their approval, but the decision is
		yours.

				MIRIAM
		What about the legalities of this...?

				NOVAK
		Stargher is in custody.  The functional
		equivalent of being under arrest. 
		Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he
		didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. 
		But because of his condition, he doesn't
		have the capacity to waive those rights.

				HENRY
		So what you're asking us to do is
		illegal?

				NOVAK
		No, not at all.
			(explains)
		We're dealing with exigent
		circumstances.  Somewhere there's a
		kidnapped woman still alive.  If we
		weigh the suspect's Constitutional
		Rights against the public safety. 
		The Law favors the victim and gives us a
		lot of leeway.  It's called the Public
		Safety Exception.

				COOPERMAN
		So what can you do?

				NOVAK
		Pretty much anything we want.  There's a
		chance to save a human life.  Because of
		that, Stargher has no reasonable
		expectation of privacy.

	Miriam, Henry and Cooperman appear to be onboard.  Novak's
	made a persuasive, heartfelt argument.  Only one person still
	remains uncertain.

				CATHERINE
		What if...?

	All eyes turn to her.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What if he wasn't like this?  What if he
		was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would
		you go?

				NOVAK
		As far as I needed.

	Catherine nods, analyzes Novak's eyes, gestures, body
	language, and "interrogates" him.

				CATHERINE
		Do you think he'd tell you what you need
		to know?

	John's discomfort is increasing and Novak is sensitive to it.

				NOVAK
		There's always a chance they'll confess.

				CATHERINE
		Really?  I don't work with violent
		cases, I work with children.  But even a
		kid lies.  They love it when they get
		you to believe something that isn't
		true.  Don't you think Stargher would do
		the same?

				NOVAK
		Sometimes... Once they've been caught
		they feel a need for disclosure.  They
		have so much they want to tell. 
		But they've never had a sympathetic ear. 
		They need someone to understand why.
			(focusing on Catherine)
		Stargher used to hide the bodies very
		carefully.  It was part of the ritual. 
		Some weren't found for weeks and any
		physical evidence had been meticulously
		wiped clean.  But these last three...
		They were still in water - always in
		water - but
			(clarifies)
		Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It
		went beyond that...

				CATHERINE
		Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to
		find him, that some part of him hated
		what he was doing... Most likely, that
		part is dead.  Schizophrenics with
		Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with
		the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.

				RAMSEY
		Is it possible?

				CATHERINE
		If he came to trust me, yes, but it
		takes months to build that kind of
		trust.  Someone like Stargher can't
		distinguish between fantasy and reality. 
		It's all the same.  He might tell me
		she's in Timbuktu and absolutely, one
		hundred percent believe it to be true,
		but she's...

				JOHN (O.S.)
		Julia.

	They turn to John Tracy.  His vulnerable, barely audible
	voice forcing everyone to listen.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		Not "she."  Julia.  Not thing, or it, or
		her.  Do you know anything about her? 
		Do you know what we've been through? 
		Julia is everything to me.  Can you say
		that about anyone?  

	Catherine hangs her head.  And finds herself looking at
	photograph of the girl in question.  A smiling Julia Hickson
	looking right at her.

	WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  POUNDING REVERBERATIONS...

	EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

	WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  A HELICOPTER descends onto the pad. 
	A stretcher is removed from the side door of the helicopter.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - VARIOUS/TRAVELLING - DAY

	The STAFF watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a
	stretcher bearing the catatonic Stargher is wheeled FAST
	through the corridors by an FBI escort team.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	Hundreds of photographs, drawings, diagrams, maps,
	blueprints, and documents - Novak's case material - cover
	every inch of wallspace.  The table is littered with
	reference books, atlases, telephones, a fax machine, short
	wave radio, and computer/Internet terminal.  An FBI
	TECHNICIAN completes the electronics work and points out the
	"speed dial" functions to Novak and Ramsey.

				FBI TECH

		Quantico.  San Diego Field Office. 
		S.D., L.A., and San Francisco P.D. 
		California, Arizona, Nevada State
		Police.  Nine and ten are open lines.

		Direct link to the chopper.
			(re: the computer)
		That gets you into the Bureau Database.

				NOVAK
		Thanks.

	Once he's gone, Ramsey takes this moment "alone" to question
	his partner.

				RAMSEY
		You sure you want to go through with
		this?

				NOVAK
		What else do we do?!

				RAMSEY
		I don't know, Pete, but for god's
		sake... This is nuts.  Do you really
		understand what they're going to do?

				NOVAK
		I don't have to.

				RAMSEY
		Why jeopardize what we've already done? 
		We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl
		Stargher.  That's going to be like
		Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes
		careers.  But if we push our luck.  If
		this is all bullshit and we come out
		smelling like it.

				NOVAK
		Tell you what.  If this thing burns us,
		I take that heat.  I give you permission
		to point your finger at me and say "It
		was all his idea."

				RAMSEY
			(offended)
		That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. 
		I'm talking about waking up and
		realizing this girl's gonna die.

	The words are anathema to Novak.

				NOVAK
		That won't happen.

	Cooperman appears in the doorway and informs them...

				COOPERMAN
		They're ready.

	Ramsey looks to his partner, but Novak is already on
	Cooperman's heels.  Resignedly, Ramsey follows.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	Cooperman guides Novak and Ramsey into the lab.  The FBI men
	are impressed, but neither is quite sure what to make it all. 
	The FBI escort team leader gets Ramsey's signature and Novak
	undoes the cuffs from Stargher's wrists and ankles. 
	Following Miriam's direction, the escorts guide the gurney
	carrying Stargher into the procedure room.  As Cooperman
	shows them out, Henry seals shut the door.  Miriam assumes
	responsibility for Stargher's care and checks his pulse, IV,
	pupil dilation, and vital signs...

				HENRY
		Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?

				MIRIAM
		They took care of that, thank you,
		Henry.
			(getting him out of her hair)

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Why don't you give our guests a little
		tour?

	Proud of his computer, but uncomfortable around strangers,
	Henry directs Novak and Ramsey to the console.

				HENRY
		Gentlemen, you stand before the one and
		only Neurological Cartography and
		Synaptic Transfer System.

	Although he's listening, Novak's eyes never really stray from
	his prisoner as Miriam uses safety scissors to cut away
	Stargher's clothes.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		It provides a highly detailed map of the
		human mind.  Not the brain - any MRI can
		do that.  The mind.
			(self-impressed)
		It reads and processes electronically
		allowing information to be transferred
		and interrupted.
			(for the laymen)
		Let's say your thoughts could be stored
		on DVD.  If someone had the right kind
		of player, they could watch and listen
		to what you're thinking.

	Novak observes Miriam as she "undresses" Stargher and Ramsey
	pokes around the lab.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		But we can't record or store the data. 
		The connections between nerve cells are
		constantly being modified.

	Miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars.  Henry
	continues, eager to focus attention back to him, but even he
	is fascinated by Stargher's skin.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		It's like the early days of television. 
		The subject sends out a live feed and
		you receive it during time of broadcast. 
		Whatever happens, happens.  All you have
		to do is "tune in."

	Miriam gives Stargher an alcohol bath, the clinical procedure
	taking on the quality of ritual.  Her wash cloth moves under
	Stargher's chin and over his face.  She's careful around the
	eyes and finds herself unable to look at them for long.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		But you do more than tune in... You
		become part of the snow.

	Catherine enters from a dressing area wearing the bodysuit. 
	Filled with curiosity, Novak watches Miriam and Catherine fit
	Stargher into his suit.

				NOVAK
		I still don't understand why I can't do
		this... This isn't some "troubled kid"
		you're dealing with.

				CATHERINE
		I realize that...

				NOVAK
		How hard could it be...?

	Catherine and Miriam try to hide their laughter.

				CATHERINE
		The first... What?  Six or seven times I
		went in.   Remember what happened?

				MIRIAM
		Disorientation, nausea, migraines,
		hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.

				CATHERINE
		Like a New Year's Day hangover.

				MIRIAM
		He needs to be turned over.

	Novak and Catherine roll Stargher onto his stomach.

				NOVAK
		This man is deeply disturbed, he...

				CATHERINE
		You don't know the procedure.

				NOVAK
		I know him.

				MIRIAM
		That may be true, but you don't have
		Catherine's gift.  She...
			(distracted by Stargher's back)
		What happened here?

	We see a series of EIGHT BANDAGES.

				RAMSEY
		We removed eight metal rings.

	Miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh.

				CATHERINE
		Then he should like this.

	Catherine connects Stargher to the SUSPENSION APPARATUS and
	it HOISTS him off the table.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		They're comforted by the feeling of
		weightlessness.  Like floating in water.

	Henry catches Ramsey poking his nose near a THIRD SUIT AND
	APPARATUS in the dressing area.

				HENRY
		Don't touch that, please.

				RAMSEY
		Sorry.

	Miriam prepares a series of CHEMICAL CARTRIDGES and loads
	them into a container connected to the IV-like tubes linked
	to the suspension device.

				MIRIAM
			(intimate, quiet)
		This isn't your responsibility. 
		Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt
		as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.

				CATHERINE
		I'll be fine.

				MIRIAM
		She said convincingly.

	Catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary
	connections.  Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring
	station.  She "locks down" the procedure room and joins
	Henry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console.

				NOVAK
			(eyes on the chemical/drug
			monitors)
		That's the stuff?

				HENRY
		About twelve years of research, right
		Miriam?

				MIRIAM
		Don't remind me.

				RAMSEY
		What is it - are they - exactly?

	That's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket.

				MIRIAM
		Psychostimulants, serotonin,
		stabilizers, meprobamate, Neurontin,
		lithium carbonate.  And my baby.  It
		duplicates and expands upon the effects
		of a chemical called oxytocin, forcing a
		break in the neuron connections that
		hold experience.  So new experience can
		form.

	Ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods, but Novak is
	fascinated.  Catherine presses the bump on her hand.  A RED
	INDICATOR LIGHT flashes on.

				HENRY
		There's a touch-sensitive microchip
		implanted in her hand.  If she becomes
		frightened, disoriented, or simply wants
		to end the session, she signals us to
		abort.

	Catherine presses again and the red light shuts off.

				MIRIAM
		Although none of what she experiences is
		real, she can be tricked into thinking
		it is.  The mind is awfully gullible, so
		she needs to monitor herself.

	Catherine and Stargher are suspended from the ceiling.  Henry
	types and the lights dim to a more somber, tranquil level. 
	Various screens flicker to life, displaying the vital signs
	of both "feed" and receive."  Miriam initiates the injection
	program.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you
		want me to wait, or...

				CATHERINE
		No.  No.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, we see chemicals mix with her blood,
	then feed the IV.  AT THE CONSOLE, as Henry types furiously
	at the computer keyboard, Novak asks Miriam:

				NOVAK
		You said she has a "gift."

	Overhearing, Henry interrupts, pointing at a section of
	Catherine's "mind map."

				HENRY
		Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in
		her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A
		genetic fluke.

				MIRIAM
		Catherine has a tremendous capacity for
		empathy.
			(clarifies)
		When we started, there were a number of
		test subjects - other therapists - who
		acted as "receivers."  All they did was
		observe and report.  Nothing more.  But
		Catherine, she had the ability to feel
		what was happening.  She understood. 
		And the patient responded.  Edward
		engaged her in dialogue, took her
		places, showed her things.  He knew she
		cared.

	A hopeful, solemn Novak gazes through the window, watching
	Catherine's body as it becomes parallel to Stargher's...

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine takes a deep breath and as
	the drugs take effect, feels herself losing consciousness. 
	She glances at Stargher, a man who tortures and kills women,
	then looks up as the CLOTH MASK descends from the ceiling.

				MIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Intravenous administration complete.

				HENRY (O.S.)
		Initiating connection.

	We follow fibrous wires running from Catherine's mask to
	Stargher's.  Their blood mixing with chemicals in the IV-like
	containers.  The computer system humming.

				HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Transfer begins 1100 hours, 34 minutes,
		12 seconds.

	Catherine's eye focuses on the mask.  As it comes closer, we
	see the lining is laced with thread-like wires and microchips
	forming hyper-miniature circuit boards.  Catherine's eye
	blinks.  The mask covers her face.  Catherine's eye shuts.

	Vision fades.  Darkness.  A faint light.  Microscopic veins
	in the eyelid become wires connected to chips.  And we're
	MOVING, into the circuitry.

	ENTRANCE ONE

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

	The pattern of the electronics grows into something more
	organic, textured, concrete.  Evolving into a world.  Black
	and shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of
	vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its
	core.

	Our journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we
	occasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism.

	INTERCUT with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness
	and fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the
	apparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world.

	There is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion
	and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with
	tiny fish and tadpoles.  At water's edge, lying on rough,
	pebble-strewn ground, is a HAND.

	Catherine's hand.  We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. 
	From the darkness comes a DOG.  Black in color and
	featureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders
	into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view.  After a
	moment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we
	follow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes
	it from her own face.

	IN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET
	sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED
	ANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just
	a TWIG.  As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the
	earth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools
	of stagnant water...

	As we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the
	world into which Catherine descended.

	She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to
	her surroundings.  The "floor" is covered with filth, ash,
	pebbles, and insects.  Water is present in many forms,
	puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings.

	Eyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," Catherine notices
	the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets
	showering the air.  She turns and finds the source.

	THE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full
	of BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his "bath."  Satisfied,
	the animal stops and trots away.  Still adjusting to this
	nightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but
	then realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING.  She looks
	around, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches
	sight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers.  As
	he disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we PULL BACK
	to show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace,
	walls, stairs, and ladders.  Leading everywhere and nowhere.

	Catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." 
	Shortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she
	moves to it.  We feel as though we're looking at a series of
	interlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been
	torn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or
	doors.  Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes
	her way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIGHTED ROOM

	A mottled HORSE stands with its head down, nose kissing the
	floor, allowing the BOY to caress its neck.  This sweet
	animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and
	Catherine approaches with respect.

				CATHERINE
		Hello?

	The frightened child retreats into a corner of the
	claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. 
	Surprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate
	step toward Catherine, inviting her to take over.  Catherine
	allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along
	the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Yeah, you like that, don't you?

	She can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at
	her from the shadows.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Is your name Carl?

	The boy - YOUNG STARGHER - is startled and intrigued by the
	question - How did she know that?! - but says nothing.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Another little boy I know, he has a
		horse, too.

	The boy reacts to an unusual SOUND coming from the CEILING.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		His name's Edward.  The boy, not the
		horse...

	The boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but
	he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than
	"connecting" with Catherine.  Very anxiously, he looks at the
	wall behind Catherine and watches an old wind-up kitchen
	TIMER click down.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What's the matter, Carl?

	Again, a sharp SOUND from the ceiling.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What's wro---?

	Young Stargher RUNS at her and SHOVES her hard!  Catherine
	FALLS BACK just as EIGHT SHEETS OF GLASS drop from the
	ceiling!  Like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse
	into four clean sections.  They separate and compact the
	quadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected
	horse stand within the room.  Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare
	barely acknowledged what happened.  Betraying no emotion, the
	boy runs.  The shaken Catherine takes a moment to collect
	herself, then gives chase.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE LABYRINTH

	Young Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but
	Catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight.  She
	runs, climbs and crawls.  Until she's utterly lost and
	disoriented.  Tired and having difficulty breathing, she
	drops to her knees and "cools down."  She hears a NOISE
	nearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM
	connected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an
	almost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she
	examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs
	of "traps" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls
	the mechanism and quickly steps back.

	The shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive
	in the tiny cubicle beyond.  She retreats into shadow,
	hiding.  Released from the chamber is a WOMAN.  As she moves
	out of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE.

	Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to
	"sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the
	shadows, and ATTACKS!

	Catherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT
	THE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! 
	She brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and
	SMACKS her head against it.  Catherine drops to the floor
	like a rag doll.

	Victim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great
	purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the
	core.  Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness
	and light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a "tour" of
	Stargher's world.  Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled
	with IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing
	intensity.  At one of the rooms, we think we see Young
	Stargher silently observing...

	Sitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S
	OTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the
	grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in
	Stargher's basement.  Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine
	Inch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored
	housewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the
	"harem."
	
	
	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE CORE

	VICTIM ONE drops Catherine in the center of the room and, job
	done, crawls away.

	Groggy, feeling sick, Catherine sits up.  Unbeknownst to her,
	she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the
	kind of THRONE.  And someone is there.  In the dim pool of
	light above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. 
	The wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he
	descends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL
	RINGS pierced through the flesh of his back.  In a fluid
	motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as
	the man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. 
	Unable to stop herself, she turns.  And sees the terrifying
	face of STARGHER.  But no the same Stargher.

	This is STARGHER KING.

				STARGHER KING
			(primitive, guttural)
		Where you come from priddy thing?

	In a split second, Catherine presses the implant on her hand.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	Apparently capable of staying awake if properly caffeinated,
	Novak sits cross-legged on the floor, shoes off, analyzing
	RECENT PHOTOS AND DOCUMENTS sent to him via courier. 
	Ignoring a snoring Ramsey napping on a nearby cot, Novak
	looks at blow-ups from the videos, blueprints of Stargher's
	house, detailed shots of the basement, and a draftsman's
	conceptual drawing of the cell itself.

				HENRY (V.O.)
		Gentlemen?

	Novak looks at an INTERCOM SPEAKER.

				HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		She's back.

	Novak doesn't wait for his just-stirring partner and moves.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	As he enters, Novak sees a concerned Henry checking a print
	out of the procedure.

				NOVAK
		What happened?

				HENRY
		Must've been rather unusual.

	Noting Novak's confusion, Henry points to a CENTRAL MONITOR
	resembling a futuristic V.U. meter, gradiated in sections of
	white, yellow, orange, and red.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
			(re: white/yellow area)
		If her neural activity stays within this
		range, I know she's self-cognitive.
			(clarifies)
		As if she were having a dream, but she
		knows she's dreaming.  She can "wake up"
		any time she wants to...

	As Ramsey joins them, Novak nods, understanding, but his eyes
	are on Catherine, who's just coming back to consciousness.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
			(re: orange section)
		However, if her level of involvement is
		rather intense, as it was just now, she
		can perceive things as true.  It's
		difficult to keep perspective.

	As Novak lingers on that question, Ramsey gestures at the red
	section.

				RAMSEY
		What happens here?

				HENRY
		We don't talk about that.

				NOVAK
		What happens?

				HENRY
		Well, Theoretically, while she's inside. 
		If she came to believe that Stargher's
		world is her world, her mind has the
		power to convince the body that anything
		done to it is, um, actually done.

	Novak doesn't like the sound of that.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		That's why we monitor the use of the
		drugs so closely.  We don't want her
		getting to that degree of perceptual
		disorientation.

				MIRIAM
		Pump in two liters of pure oxygen,
		please Henry.

	Henry types a command and Novak speaks into the intercom.

				NOVAK
		Dr. Kent?

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam eases Catherine back to
	consciousness.

				MIRIAM
		Deep breaths.

	When she sees Stargher, Catherine's flesh crawls.

				CATHERINE
		Is it cold in here?

				MIRIAM
		What happened?

	No response.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

	Incapable of being in the same room as him, Catherine tears
	out of the apparatus and anxiously exits.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Catherine!

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM:

				NOVAK
		I'll get her...

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

	A worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center. 
	He's about to ask the staff for help, but stops when he sees
	through the window to Edward's room.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM

	Catherine sits next to the boy's bed, holding Edward's hand,
	softly singing a lullaby (to him, to herself).  Feeling that
	he must speak to her, Novak intervenes.

				NOVAK
		Edward Baines, I presume.
			(to the catatonic child)
		Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.

				CATHERINE
		Do you think that's funny?

				NOVAK
		No.  Not at all.  From what I
		understand, he knows I"m here, isn't
		that right?

	Catherine nods.  Novak picks up Edward's fallen teddy bear
	and rests it in the crook of the child's arm.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		I read about a woman in TExas who was in
		a coma for seven years.  Every time her
		husband came to visit, her heart would
		beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I
		don't know what name scientists have for
		something like that...

				CATHERINE
		It doesn't have much to do with science.

				NOVAK
		What then?

				CATHERINE
		The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you
		want to call it.

				NOVAK
		Ah, the part of us that can't be
		explained.

	She appreciates his understanding.  And finds herself
	comforted by his presence.  Catherine scrutinizes Novak, his
	intensity, his honesty, his complexity.  And asks:

				CATHERINE
		Agent Novak?

				NOVAK
		Peter, okay?

				CATHERINE
		Do you feel there's a side of yourself
		you don't show people?

	The question catches Novak off-guard, but he's willing to
	answer.  Anything to get her talking.

				NOVAK
		Absolutely.
			(realizing it's too personal)
		I suppose everyone does.

				CATHERINE
		Just like we all have fantasies, right? 
		Things only we know, that we don't
		share.

				NOVAK
		That's what therapists are for, right?

	Catherine laughs.  It helps her relax.  If only slightly.

				CATHERINE
		During the sessions.  When I'm inside. 
		I see those things.  What a person
		hides, what they despite, what they want
		to control.  With Stargher...

	This is difficult for her.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		With Stargher I saw things...

				NOVAK
		What did you see?

				CATHERINE
			(professionally)
		A kingdom.  His utopia. 
		Life without consequence or restriction. 
		He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. 
		He's this... idealized version of
		himself who can do anything he
		pleases... Without fear.  A horrible
		primitive ugly thing.
			(uncomfortable; re: Edward)
		I don't want to talk in here.

	She kisses Edward's forehead and exits.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY

	Catherine and Novak sit on a bench in the center of the
	courtyard.  John Tracy is visible in the reception area,
	unable to sleep, desperately trying to fight frustration.

				CATHERINE
		Why'd you bring him here?

				NOVAK
		You're the shrink, you tell me.

				CATHERINE
			(already knows)
		As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say
		yes.  He makes Julia real for me.

	Novak nods.  Guilty.

				NOVAK
		It's an old lawyer trick.  Target the
		emotions.  Do it right, you get a
		reluctant witness to testify, a scared
		kid to confess.

	Catherine looks at him with disbelief.  "You?!"

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Before I was with the Bureau, I was an
		attorney, a prosecutor.  Mr. Law and
		Order.  And then... I had a murder case
		in North Carolina.  Charles Gish. 
		Butchered seventeen people in three
		days.  And because of one tiny piece of
		tainted evidence, he walked.
			(no regrets)
		That's when I quit the DA's office and
		joined the FBI.

	Catherine can see the pain and frustration in Novak's eyes. 
	She gives him a moment and asks:

				CATHERINE
		You thought Stargher wanted to be
		caught.

				NOVAK
		I did, yeah.

				CATHERINE
		You were right.  There's a part of him
		that knows the truth.  About what he
		did, about himself.

	Novak's curiosity is piqued.

				NOVAK
		What about Julia?

				CATHERINE
		This is going to sound terrible, but...
		I don't think she matters anymore.  Not
		to him.  He never finished her.  The
		others...he was able to make them his.

				NOVAK
		You think you can do this, don't you?

				CATHERINE
		He might tell me about Julia.  The part
		of him that wants to help, that feels
		shame and remorse.  Who wants to be
		redeemed.

				NOVAK
			(skeptically)
		This is Stargher we're talking about?

				CATHERINE
		Not Stargher, not really.  He's split
		himself right down the middle. 
		Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. 
		A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I
		could reach the boy.

				NOVAK
		Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same
		guy?

				CATHERINE
		Don't you feel there are different sides
		to every personality?  Maybe even the
		worst of us is capable of one decent
		act.  We're all human.

				NOVAK
		It's hard for me to see Stargher as
		human, capable of something like
		"remorse."

				CATHERINE
		Then what is he?

				NOVAK
		Evil.

				CATHERINE
		If you believe that.

				NOVAK
		Maybe this is a big fucking waste of
		time.

				CATHERINE
			(sensing something)
		What happened to Charles Gish?

	Novak doesn't respond.  She prods him.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What happened?

				NOVAK
		What difference does it make...?

				CATHERINE
		Tell me.

	God, he does not want to do this.

				NOVAK
		Right after the trial, the night after
		he was released.  Mr. and Mrs. Frank
		Simmons found Charlie sitting in their
		living room watching TV with their
		twelve-year old daughter Margaret.  He'd
		cut her right down the middle with a
		carving knife.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Found the girl's heart in the freezer -
		he thought they might want to keep it.
			(grim humor)
		Luckily, the next thing he did was slit
		his own throat.
			(bleakly)
		I am convinced of one thing. 
		Charles Gish could've been raised by
		Ozzie and Harriet and the same thing
		would've happened.

	He can see Catherine doesn't accept that.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		A child can experience abuse worse than
		Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone
		who would never, ever hurt another
		living thing.

				CATHERINE
		You're sure of that?

				NOVAK
		Yes.  I am.

	Catherine realizes that was a confession.

				RAMSEY (O.S.)
		Where the hell you been?

	They turn to see Ramsey.

				NOVAK
		Right here.

				RAMSEY
		Next time, tell me, okay?

				NOVAK
		But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...

	Ramsey shoots him a murderous look, then asks Catherine.

				RAMSEY
		Your colleagues want to know what to do
		with Stargher.

	Novak looks to Catherine for the answer.  Through the window
	blinds, she watches John Tracy lower his head.

				CATHERINE
		Tell them to prep him.  And that I'll be
		right there.

	Ramsey nods and heads back to the lab.

				NOVAK
		Thank you.

	Briefly, he touches her hand.  Catherine looks away from John
	to Novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall.  Stargher's
	house, Valentine, the pick-up truck.  Valentine...

				CATHERINE
		I need something.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CORRIDOR - DAY

	A K-9 UNIT FBI AGENT escorts VALENTINE to the lab.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring
	area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection." 
	Slowly, confidently, she approaches the Shepherd, kneels, and
	removes his leash and muzzle.  She strokes him and the dog
	instantly warms up to her.

				FBI K-9 AGENT
		Sure wasn't like that with me.

	Novak signs a document and the K-9 Agent exits.

				CATHERINE
		You're a good boy, aren't you,
		Valentine?

	The dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves
	it, Catherine and Novak following.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Stargher lies face down on a gurney. 
	Now taped to the wall near Stargher are PICTURES from the
	basement - his dolls, the hoist, etc.  Miriam (in surgical
	mask and gloves) carefully re-inserts the METAL RINGS (taken
	from an FBI EVIDENCE BAG) into the eight straps of flesh on
	his back.  When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides. 
	Catherine comforts him.  Miriam finishes her task and removes
	her mask.

				MIRIAM
		I hate to admit it, but there's
		something perversely satisfying about
		this.

				HENRY
		I think that's the whole point.

	Valentine runs to his "sleeping" master and barks at
	Catherine as if asking for help.  She encourages the animal
	to lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands.

				HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		That's interesting.

	IN THE CONTROL ROOM, he scrutinizes the monitor showing the
	detailed "map" of Stargher's brain.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		Increased neural activity in the frontal
		lobes.  Rising dopamine levels in the
		basal ganglia.  Ever since the dog
		walked in.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine readies herself in the
	"receive" apparatus.  As Stargher is lifted off the pedestal,
	the doors HISS shut and Valentine curls up on the floor
	beneath his master.  As Catherine is lifted, she smiles at
	the animal, then looks to Stargher.

				NOVAK
			(comforting and coaching her)
		Remember, Julia Hickson is priority
		number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find
		out where she is.

				CATHERINE
		Okay, okay...

	LIGHTS FLICKER.  Catherine's eyes shut.  FADE TO BLACK...

				HENRY (O.S.)
		Uh-oh...

	LIGHTS FLICKER.  We hear an ELECTRICAL HUM rise and fall. 
	Catherine opens her eyes and the LIGHTS blink on and off in a
	weird pattern, making it difficult to see clearly.

				CATHERINE
		Don't kid around, Henry...

	Her suspension apparatus DESCENDS on the floor.

				HENRY (O.S.)
		I'm not.  It's a power problem.  I need
		you to go to the circuit breaker and
		check switches six through twelve.

	Catherine moves toward the electrical panel.

				HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Try to stay awake, okay?

				CATHERINE
		Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not sleepy.

	As she moves toward the panel, everything becomes larger.  By
	the time Catherine reaches the circuit breaker, it is the
	size of a garage door.  Curiouser and curiouser...

	She turns around to see the LABORATORY IS EMPTY and DEAD
	QUIET.  And she sees herself - Catherine as small as a mouse
	trapped in a giant walled space.

	AT THE CONSOLE, Novak, Miriam and Henry observe the procedure
	room.  And Catherine.  Suspended in the apparatus. 
	Motionless...

	ENTRANCE TWO

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

	Catherine turns to see... Catherine lying in the fetal
	position, locked in a BOX made of thick clean glass.  The
	electronic HUM becomes RHYTHMIC, AMBIENT NOISE.. INSIDE THE
	BOX, staying calm, she searches for and finds a TRAP DOOR on
	the floor.  She pushes out.  The camera executes a complete
	180-degree perspective change.

	Catherine plummets.  She tries to reach out, to stop her
	descent, but cannot.

	Catherine falls through a dark CAVERNOUS ROOM resembling a
	mammoth hollowed-out rib cage.  Below her is a DOME-LIKE
	STRUCTURE "growing" out of the floor, a HOLE in the center of
	its crest.  Dozens of other such domes are visible in the
	murky hell-hole, but Catherine has no choice.  She's dropping
	into this one.

	Once she passes through the hole, INSIDE THE DOME,
	Catherine's body looks as though it's moving through water,
	but there is no water.  Like an aerial artist, she reverses
	her position so she's "heads up."  Standing, stable, on the
	floor.  Sensing something with her.  And knows it is...

				CATHERINE
		Valentine?

	Out from the darkness, moving in normal motion, comes the
	white German Shepherd, but in the thick haze, his face is
	indistinct and ghostly.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Hi sweetie...

	And as she steps toward him, his face DISSOLVES into a STARK
	LANDSCAPE.  An ear becomes a hill, the nose a stone, mouth a
	path, and the eye a HOUSE. 
	YOUNG STARGHER retreats towards the bleak structure as
	CATHERINE ENTERS FRAME.  Seeing the invitation, she presses
	on.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BOYHOOD HOME - KITCHEN

	Young Stargher is at the sink WASHING DISHES, an anxious eye
	on the clock.

				CATHERINE
		Need some help?

	As Catherine enters the claustrophobic house, the boy
	hesitantly pushes a towel toward her, but doesn't look.  She
	reaches the counter and starts to dry, much to Young
	Stargher's relief.  As he washes, Catherine hands him a
	MIRROR LOCKET just like Edward's.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Carl, I want to give you a present.

	He's hypnotized by the thing, his eyes lighting up.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		If you need me, or if you feel that I'm
		around but can't find me, just shine it,
		like this.

	She shines reflected light onto the walls.  Carl hands
	Catherine the wet plate and takes the locket.  The dish slips
	from her fingers and SHATTERS on the floor.  The boy's eyes
	fill with dread.  The kitchen clock reads 5:30.  He PUSHES
	Catherine toward a broom closet and shoves her inside.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What's wrong honey?

	With a finger to his lips, he pockets the locket and shuts
	the door.  FROM WITHIN THE CLOSET, she watches the terrified
	child through a CRACK in the door.  IN THE KITCHEN, Young
	Stargher desperately tries to hide the broken plate. 
	Startlingly, his father, Martin Stargher, is already in the
	room.  Cruel, imposing, manipulative man.

				MARTIN
		What did you do know?  You make a mess? 
		I hate a mess.

	Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		Don't lie, now, Carl.

	IN THE CLOSET, Catherine pushes, but the door won't budge. 
	She POUNDS.  IN THE KITCHEN, we hear no sound.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		Remember what I said about liars?  Liars
		will be punished.

	INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

	Catherine hears the child SCREAM.  But the scream comes from
	behind and she spins around.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIVING ROOM

	Young Stargher is forced to sit on the lap of an ugly MIDDLE
	AGED WOMAN barely wearing a man's robe.  On a nearby table
	are whisky, tumblers, and an ashtray filled with butts.

				WOMAN
		I got you a present, cutie-pie.

	She gives him a TOY DOLL.  Drunk, she hugs and kisses him. 
	Embarrassed, the boy tries to squirm away.

				WOMAN (CONT'D)
		Oh no.  You're not going anywhere.

	Martin enters and sneers at the boy.

				MARTIN
		Go back to bed, worm.

				WOMAN
		It's okay, we was just.

				MARTIN
		Shut up, cunt.

	The woman cowers, familiar with his violent moods.  The boy
	hurries to his room, but Martin grabs him by the collar.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		What is that?

	He pulls the doll from the child's hands, turns to the woman,
	and SMACKS her across the face with it, gashing her cheek.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		You give him nothing.  Whore.  Are you
		his mother?  ARE YOU?

	Terrified, she shakes her head "no."  Martin sees Young
	Stargher quietly crawling away, hoping to escape. 
	Martin lifts the boy off the floor with one hand and holds
	him in front of the woman.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		You see that?  SEE IT?  You slithered
		out one of them.  But where is she now,
		Carl?  As far from you as she could get,
		that's where.
			(shoves him at the woman)
		You want a mommy?  Is that what you
		want?

	The poor boy trembles with fear.  And Martin notices a puddle
	of urine on the floor.  He drops the boy and laughs.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		Little worm pissed his pants.

	Humiliated, Carl covers himself and hides in a corner. 
	Martin and the woman LAUGH AND LAUGH, delighting in the boy's
	humiliation.

	INT. CLOSET

	Feeling the boy's shame, Catherine turns and finds a FADED
	POSTCARD taped to the wall.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BEDROOM

	Martin has discovered his son's secret hiding place - a
	camouflaged corner of the attic.  Arranged in deliberate,
	artistic fashion are scavenged DOLLS.  Heads, limbs and
	torsos held together with twine, tape and wire.  Some wrapped
	in filthy plastic.  Faded photographs (including one of his
	MOTHER), mementos, and most disturbingly, the feathers and
	bones of dead birds, insect carcasses, and dissected,
	desiccated mice.  There's something peculiarly beautiful
	here, but Martin doesn't see it.  Not at all.

				MARTIN
		Only girls play with dolls...

	He turns and we see Carl is bound to a wooden support beam, a
	piece of tape covering his mouth.  The boy is stripped to the
	waste, barely conscious, face streaked with tears and sweat.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		What kind of thing are you?

	INT. CLOSET

	A WEIRD NOISE snaps Catherine back to "reality."  She turns
	just as a door opens behind her.  Responding to the
	"invitation," she moves through it.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM

	The adult Carl Stargher sits at the edge of the tub, his back
	to us, smoking a cigarette.  A white German Shepherd PUPPY
	clicks across the tile floor and YIPS at Catherine.  She
	again hears the WEIRD NOISE.  A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL wobbles
	as Stargher's bloody rubber-gloved hands fill it with
	something.  Stargher knows she's there and isn't surprised by
	her presence, but he's not sure what to make of her.  What to
	do with her.  He rises and walks past her to the sink.  He
	pulls off the gloves and washes his hands, glancing at her in
	the mirror.

	Catherine cannot resist looking in the tub.  She sees a dead
	girl, her torso sliced open.  Disgusted and mortified, she
	pulls back.

				STARGHER (O.S.)
		She was the first...

	She turns, and Stargher is no longer at the sink.

				STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Didn't know what I was doing...

	She turns, where's this voice coming from?!  She steps back.

				STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Be careful...

	The bumps into the stainless steel bowl and it topples to the
	floor, spilling its contents of human organs.  Wobble-wobble
	wobble.  The bowl makes its now-familiar noise.

				STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		What did you do now?  You make a mess?

	And she can see him coming out of the shadows.  Catherine
	backs into a corner, fearing what will come.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		I hate a mess.

	Stargher steps into a pool of light, shooshes the puppy into
	the hall, shuts the bathroom door, and looks right at
	Catherine.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Why are you here?

	God almighty, what does she say?  What does she tell him?!

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Don't lie, now...

	SCRITCH-SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  The puppy scratches at the door and
	whimpers, but Stargher's not about to let him back in. 
	Moving slowly, carefully, he approaches Catherine.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Liars will be punished.  

	Catherine makes a break for the door.  "Playfully," Stargher
	makes a half-hearted attempt to block her, but she evades him
	and reaches for the knob.  But the door's not there.  SCRITCH
	SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  She can still hear the dog, but there's no
	damn door.  She turns:

	No door.  No window.  The girl's body and bloody remains have
	vanished.  An OVERHEAD LIGHT flickers on, giving the room the
	look and feel of the cell.

				STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Where do you think you're going?

	Catherine turns, back to the wall, calm and intimidating,
	Stargher stands in the center regarding her with great
	curiosity.  Catherine's ready to press the sensor.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Don't do that.

	She hesitates.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		If you go away, you'll never find her.

	How did he know?

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		If you never find her, she dies.  Like
		the rest.

	Catherine stops and listens.  She can't leave now.  The path
	to Julia has appeared.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		I mean, that's why you're here, right? 
		Why you came to my happy little home?

	He reaches for her and she flinches.  Expecting such
	behavior, Stargher grins.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		You're pretty.  A pretty, pretty thing.

	Catherine cannot show her fear, not now.  She composes
	herself and approaches him.

				CATHERINE
		I want to help you, Carl.

	His grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs.

				STARGHER
		Help me?  That's good.  That's a good
		one.
			(malevolent)
		Liar.  Whore.  Cunt.

	Catherine stands her ground.

				CATHERINE
		You sound like your father.

	He gets close to her face and sneers.

				STARGHER
		I am not like him.

	Stargher retreats into the shadows, but Catherine persists.

				CATHERINE
		Then help me.  Where is Julia Hickson?

				STARGHER
		Why?

				CATHERINE
		Maybe, because you want to.

				STARGHER
		Is that right?  You think you know me?
			
			
			INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	Henry sees a rapid rise in Catherine's warning meter.

				HENRY
		Miriam...

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM

	A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.

				STARGHER (O.S.)
		You wanna know who I am?  You stupid
		bitch!

	And when he emerges from shadow, Stargher is STARGHER KING.

				STARGHER KING
		Now shud you mouth, priddy thing, or me
		god slice you from the kunt to the tits.

	Catherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand.  He GRABS,
	LIFTS and SLAMS her onto the floor, the back of her head
	HITTING HARD.  Her vision blurs.  Ears are ringing.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		Me god want you stay.

	Stargher King straddles Catherine and pins her arms behind
	her back.  She's unable to touch the sensor.  With the tip of
	the TOOL he traces a line from her pelvis up the center of
	her suit.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		Me god mek you beaudiful...

	He shoves the tool through her neck and presses the trigger.  
	A COLLAR CLAMPS SHUT around Catherine's neck and...

	She blacks out.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	A SENSOR ALARM SOUNDS on the computer.  Henry and Miriam
	express shock at the sight of the monitor peaking in the red
	and move to the "map" of Catherine's mind.  As it becomes
	"cool," Stargher's becomes "hot."

				MIRIAM
		Son of a bitch!

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, VALENTINE BARKS!  Startling everyone. 
	The dog GROWLS and backs away.  As if he senses something
	horribly wrong within his master.

	IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Novak questions the scientists.

				NOVAK
		When we got here, you just topped and
		pulled her out.

				MIRIAM
		That was with Edward.  She's accustomed
		to his world.  Stargher's mind is
		unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."
			(looks at the third suit)
		Someone has to go in. 
		Remind her what's really happening.  And
		get her out.  Until then, she's at his
		mercy.

	Mercy.  Novak's mind reels.

				NOVAK
		Into Stargher.  Inside...

				MIRIAM
		Yes.

	Novak knows who that person will be.

	INT. CELL - DAY

	Fueling herself with candy and juice, Julia examines the cell
	for a way out, but finds tight seals everywhere.  THE SHOWER
	ERUPTS WITH WATER!   She counts until thirty, it stops. 
	Shivering, Julia stars at the drain as the water spirals
	down.

				JULIA
			(trying to remember the words)
		Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed
		be thy name.  Thy kingdom come, thy will
		be done.

	ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS, we watch her through one-way
	glass from the video camera's point-of-view.  She looks right
	at "us," in the mirror, saddened by the dark circles under
	her bloodshot eyes.

				JULIA (CONT'D)
		...on Earth as it is in Heaven.

	We drift to the right and see the l.e.d. counters CLICKING
	AWAY.  01:44:54, 01:44:53, 01:44:52... Less than TWO HOURS to
	live and she has no idea.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak lies in a hastily-rigged THIRD
	APPARATUS/SUSPENSION DEVICE.  Miriam connects him to the IV
	cylinder and tubes.

				MIRIAM
		I have done this, you know.  Been
		inside.

				NOVAK
		No.

	Miriam nods, knowing he won't accept an opposing argument.

				MIRIAM
			(instructs him)
		Deep breaths.

	IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Henry adjusts monitors showing
	Novak's vital signs.

				HENRY
		Pulse is rapid, pressure's a little
		high...

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam asks:

				MIRIAM
		Nervous?

				NOVAK
		Absolutely.

	She loads a MICROCHIP SENSOR into a high-pressure injection
	gun and IMPLANTS it in NOVAK's HAND.  He winces from the
	brief pain as she loads the chemical cartridges.

				MIRIAM
		I have to ask you some things... Are you
		taking any prescription drugs?

				NOVAK
		Prevacid.  For my stomach.

				MIRIAM
		Any psychiatric medication?

				NOVAK
		No.  

				MIRIAM
		What about narcotics?

				NOVAK
		No.

				MIRIAM
		I know your partner's here, but it's
		very important that you're honest.

				NOVAK
		I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.

				MIRIAM
		I doubt that.

	Henry checks the "maps,"  Catherine's vitals and reports.

				HENRY
		We should hurry.

	Miriam walks Novak through what's about to happen.

				MIRIAM
		The first five minutes will be
		disorienting.  Give yourself time.  Let
		the drugs do the work.  If you can see,
		smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're
		on the right track.  Once you've
		acclimated, try to get a feeling for
		Catherine.  Instinct plays a huge role
		in this.  Trust it.

	She gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder, exits and
	shuts the door.  IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Miriam continues
	via intercom.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		You can control how you see yourself -
		clothes, shoes, that kind of thing - but
		the rest of it is up to him.  Use only
		what he provides.  Don't try to change
		anything.  Or introduce something of
		your own.  It'll only upset him.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak flexes his fingers and sees the
	little bump beneath his flesh.

				HENRY (O.S.)
		Agent Novak?  Press the sensor.

	Novak does and the red light comes on.  As Novak is LIFTED,
	he looks at Catherine, then Stargher.  Valentine YIPS and
	settles beneath Novak.  The suspension device clicks into
	place and the MASK descends.

				MIRIAM (O.S.)
		No matter what happens, Peter, remember
		one thing: It's not real.

	Novak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the IV-like
	cylinder.  A liquid cloud of his blood grows within. 
	Preparing the mixture for injection.

	The viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the CAMERA
	MOVES INTO THE MIXTURE.  As blood and chemical swirls take
	shape, we MOVE FAST.  Deeper into the fluid at a molecular
	level.  We feel like we're SOARING over some kind of liquid
	landscape.

	NOVAK HYPERVENTILATES.  He's having difficulty making the 98
	transition.

	Flying faster, faster, faster.  Through an entire universe.

	Novak is in the procedure room.  Alone.  His face contorted
	as if feeling the effects of tremendous G-FORCE.

	ENTRANCE THREE

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

	CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with
	hills.  THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their
	bodies positioned in a uniform pattern.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL
	NOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down
	in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. 
	With difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak
	breathes deeply and rises to his knees.  His hand moves to
	his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the
	gravel, the sharpness of it against his face.  Removing the
	shroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes
	it.

				MOTHER ONE (O.S.)
		Have you seen him?

	Novak finds the first of the three - VISIONS OF STARGHER'S
	MOTHER - addressing him.  She, like the other two, speaks in
	a ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion.

				MOTHER ONE (CONT'D)
		My boy, my little one.  His father took
		him from me.  Have you seen him?

	As she continues, almost mantra-like, WOMAN TWO BEGINS:

				MOTHER TWO
			(similar monotone)
		My child is an abomination.  He is
		damned.  He has no soul.

	The women's repetitive "monologues" overlap.  Aurual layers
	now added by THREE.

				MOTHER THREE
		Me god me boy.  Me god good son.

	Novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings.  The sights,
	sounds and feel of the place.  Like being within a dream.  As
	he backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances
	across his face.  Shading his eyes.  Novak searches for the
	source.

	Opposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL.  A
	massive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows."  Like a
	star, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of
	MIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH
	cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall.

	The light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to
	CLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly
	infinite passages.  Like tombs, or the "drawers" of a
	mausoleum.  Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. 
	Fades.  And Novak crawls into darkness.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN

	Novak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence. 
	The place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty.  As he moves
	deeper into the chamber, Novak sees YOUNG STARGHER perched
	atop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror
	LOCKET, bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of
	the room

	The FLICKERING LIGHT pinpoints a FIGURE emerging from the
	darkness.  It is Catherine.  Altered to an image of
	Stargher's victims.  Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just
	like the Victims'.  It's a shocking, strange image, made even
	more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face.  Novak
	is staggered by the sight.  His vision and hearing become
	affected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to
	clarity as he reminds himself...

				NOVAK
		Not real...

	Like an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him,
	narrowing her eyes.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Catherine.

	She exhibits no recognition of her name.  Catherine
	seductively moves closer to Novak, their bodies almost
	touching, her hands caressing his hair, lips, neck...

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Jesus.  Catherine.  Listen to me...

	She presses her finger to his lips and forces him down, onto
	the floor, his back to the pedestal.  Catherine straddles
	Novak, and when he tries to stand, she holds him down,
	forcing him to stay.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		LISTEN TO ME!

	She steals a glance over his shoulder and glimpses a MALE
	FIGURE coming toward them, coming into the light.  Novak is
	utterly unaware of what's happening.  Catherine is keeping
	him occupied.  Waiting for the arrival of...

	STARGHER KING

	Catherine LAUGHS.  Novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of
	the monster before Stargher King GRABS him by the throat and
	SMASHES his head against a pedestal.

	BLACKOUT.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN

	Eyelids rise and flutter.  Novak becomes conscious.  And
	instantly realizes what's happened.

	He lies on the pedestal, face up, spread-eagle, his wrists
	and ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery
	cords.  Standing over him, in a pool of light, is Stargher
	King.  Wearing what could be seen as CEREMONIAL GARB, a
	silent, solemn Stargher King prepares himself for execution
	of a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of
	shiny, sharp, macabre TOOLS.

	Novak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself, Not real. 
	He opens them, breathes deeply and focuses on Catherine.

				NOVAK
		You're Catherine Young.  You majored in
		Psych at UC San Diego.  You work for
		Sunerset Industries.

	Stargher King's fingers pass over an array of horrific
	instruments - the throat piercer/collar mechanism, a cleaver
	knife, a misshapen hammer, a long slender needle...

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Your grandmother raised you after your
		parents died in a car crash...

	Stargher King lifts the blade-like NEEDLE.  So far, Catherine
	looks at Novak like he's speaking gibberish.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		When you were twenty-one, you were
		arrested for possession and got off with
		community service.

	Stargher King SLICES through Novak's clothes, exposing the
	flesh of his abdomen.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
			(reminding himself)
		Not real, Pete...This is not real...
			(urgency)
		You had to work at a center for abused
		kids for three months.  You stayed on
		two years for no pay.  You give half
		your fucking salary to the nursing home
		your grandmother stays at...

	Stargher King grabs his throat and traces the blade down the
	center of Novak's torso.  Novak struggles and pleads with
	Catherine.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		I know this because I work for the FBI. 
		Peter Novak, remember?!?!
			(a desperate request)
		Remember.  You are Cath-

	Stargher King cuts his flesh and INSERTS the needle into his
	stomach.  NOVAK SCREAMS!  This fucking hurts!

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Help me!!!

	Stargher King wiggles the needle, pulls it out, and digs his
	finger into the wound.  NOVAK CRIES IN PAIN.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
			(tears forming, horrified)
		Fucking FEELS real!

	The intensity of Novak's cries hit Catherine like a
	thunderbolt.  There's a glimmer of life, of recognition in
	her eyes.

				STARGHER KING
			(finally speaking)
		Me god gut you like a dear.

	Although we don't see it, we HEAR something awful.  Like
	Stargher King fishing around inside the wound.  A pale,
	sweating Novak tries to stay conscious.  He will not go into
	shock...

				NOVAK
		Not real.  Not real.  Not real.

	A FEMALE HAND grabs the tool from the tray.

				STARGHER KING
			(mimicking Novak, laughing)
		Nod reel, nod reel, nod reel...

	STARGHER KING IS SLAMMED FROM BEHIND!  CATHERINE RAMS THE
	THING THROUGH HIS THROAT!   As Stargher King stumbles away
	gagging, blood pouring form his neck, we see that she has
	returned to normal.  The "bride" persona is gone.  As
	Stargher King emits animalistic growls, Catherine turns and
	sees an intact Novak standing next to her.  As if nothing had
	happened.

	Catherine and Novak RUN out of the den, into the tunnel from
	which Novak gained access.  He stops, ready to press the
	sensor, when a FLICKER OF LIGHT dances across Catherine's
	face.

				CATHERINE
		Wait...

				NOVAK
		Like hell "wait."

	But she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she
	moves further from the den toward the cliff face.  The
	FLICKER OF LIGHT shines on the entrance to a specific TUNNEL.

				CATHERINE
		He wants us to follow.  The little
		boy...

				NOVAK
		Little boy?!  That's him!

				CATHERINE
		He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you
		want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust
		him.

	INT. TUNNEL/CUBBYHOLE

	On her hands and knees, she enters the TUNNEL, not waiting
	for him to respond.  She knows what he'll do... Catherine and
	Novak crawl through the dark, grimy claustrophobic space,
	playing with his mirror locket.

				CATHERINE
		Carl...

	He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him
	from reaching out to her.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		This is Peter.

	Scared, he shakes his head "no."

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Don't be scared.  You're my friend and I
		would never hurt you.

	She extends her hand.  Oh-so-hesitantly he takes it.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Will you take us to her?  To Julia?

	Shyly, hesitantly, he nods.  She smiles gratefully and
	affectionately touches the boy's face.  Clasping her hand,
	Young Stargher leads Catherine and Novak into utter darkness.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE IDEALIZED CELL

	More stylized than the actual cell, it's bigger and ornately
	decorated, with the atmosphere of a church.  Individual
	IMAGES hang like SHRINES, each showing Julia Hickson from
	different angles.

	Central to the room is a WINDOW INTO THE CELL ITSELF.  Where
	we find a beautiful, mermaid-like JULIA HICKSON floating in
	water.  Peaceful, joyous.

	IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, we find Novak and Catherine, she
	holding the hand of Young Stargher, he stunned at the sight
	of Julia.  The child looks at Catherine with beatific, sad
	eyes, regarding her as one would a saviour.

				NOVAK
		Where the hell are we?

				CATHERINE
		Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...

	He shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		It's okay, it's okay.  You helped so
		much already.  I'm proud of you.

	As a frustrated Novak searches for anything identifying,
	Catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad,
	haunted eyes.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Carl, I think I can help you.  Would you
		like that?  Even if Peter can't find
		Julia, I want to help you.

	The boy leans against her and she caresses his face.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I promise.

	Novak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell. 
	Mounted beneath the glass is a shiny, perfect metal plaque
	reading CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, with a logo.  Novak
	recognizes it from the hoist in Stargher's basement.

				NOVAK
		Let's go.

	He pulls her to her feet.  Feeling betrayed and rejected, the
	child breaks away from her.  THE ROAR OF STARGHER KING shakes
	the cell.  Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.

				CATHERINE
		CARL!

	Novak feels what's coming.

				NOVAK
		COME ON!

				CATHERINE
		I can't leave him!

	STARGHER KING APPEARS!  His throat wounded, bloody mess, he
	descends out of dark nothingness, HOWLING with rage.  He
	reaches for Catherine, but Young Stargher runs in front of
	her.  

	STARGHER KING CLAMPS HIS MASSIVE ARMS AROUND THE CHILD! 
	Little Carl opens his mouth in a silent scream... Catherine's
	arms reach out to him, but Novak clasps her hand and presses. 
	And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the
	arms of a monster...

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	Henry notices significant activity on the monitors.

				HENRY
		They're back.

	Everything happens fast.  He and Miriam frantically cease the
	procedure. 
	Novak and Catherine are lowered and Novak startles them by
	quickly regaining consciousness.  Miriam attempts to inject
	him with stabilizing drugs, but he's already trying to tear
	himself out of the apparatus.

				NOVAK
		Get me out!

	Miriam MOVES into the PROCEDURE ROOM.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		GET ME OUT!

	Miriam tries to follow protocol, but Novak is moving like a
	fish caught in a net, ripping and tearing his way out of the
	apparatus and suit.  He gets to his feet, but soon falls to
	his knees, dizzy and disoriented.

				MIRIAM
		Don't move!

	Novak is not listening.  Fighting off any after-effects- both
	physical and mental - he moves for the door.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Agent Novak!

	Catherine is coming back and Miriam moves to her.  Novak
	pauses just for a moment.

				NOVAK
		Is she alright?

				MIRIAM
		Yes.  But you're going to sit down right
		now.  I have to...

	Novak is already gone.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM

	Novak speed-dials a number on speaker-phone, hurriedly
	dresses, and locates a photograph of Stargher's basement. 
	When he hears someone pick up the line, he barks:

				NOVAK
		This is Novak, who've I got?

	A confused Ramsey enters and listens.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT

	A team of FBI AGENTS is meticulously going through every inch
	of Stargher's house. 
	Crisscrossed wooden beams have been laid across the pit
	allowing forensics experts to search without disturbing
	anything.  On the other end of the direct line is COLE...

				COLE
		Agent Cole.

	(INTERCUT WITH NOVAK AND RAMSEY)

				NOVAK
		I need you to find something in the
		basement...

				COLE
		Already there.

				NOVAK
		That hoist, with the winch...

	WE FOLLOW Cole as he moves to the machine.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		There's some kind of plaque, a metal
		plate, with a logo.  On the base.

	Cole locates it.

				COLE
			(reading)
		Carver Industrial Equipment.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM

	Novak instructs him...

				NOVAK
		Find out the history of that machine. 
		Who bought it, used it, sold it.  And
		check Stargher's pay stubs.  I want to
		know every contractor he worked for. 
		I'm calling you from the chopper in ten
		minutes.

	Dizziness and disorientation again hit Novak.  Pale and
	sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.

				RAMSEY
		Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.

				NOVAK
		Considering where I've been...

	Fighting the pain, he gathers together MAPS, slips on his
	shoes and grabs gun and holster.  Ramsey is apoplectic.

				RAMSEY
		Whoa-whoa-whoa.  Mind telling me what
		the fuck is happening?

	 Novak points to the photo of Stargher's basement,
	specifically the hoist.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		You're bettin' the farm on something you
		saw after they pumped you full of god
		knows-what kind of shit?

				NOVAK
		I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw
		everything.

				RAMSEY
		You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing
		with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.

	Novak is not stopping...

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam shines the penlight into
	Catherine's eyes.

				CATHERINE
		...a pocketful of rye.

				MIRIAM
		Four and twenty blackbirds...

				CATHERINE
		Baked in a pie.

	AT THE CONSOLE, on a security monitor, Henry can see Novak
	and Ramsey exiting down the corridor.

				HENRY
		The FBI has left the building.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam appears concerned.

				MIRIAM
		Damn him.

				CATHERINE
		What's wrong?

				MIRIAM
		Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to
		clear him.

	Catherine encourages her.

				CATHERINE
		Go.  I'm fine.  Go.

	As Miriam hurries to catch Novak, she tells Henry.

				MIRIAM
		Keep an eye on her.

	He nods, but isn't really paying attention.  Catherine turns
	to Stargher's motionless form, still suspended, still
	connected to the machinery.

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

				JULIA
		Do something, Julia.

	She looks around the room and runs her hands along the walls,
	the tile, looking for a weak spot.  She focuses on the
	CEILING PANEL and although it's painful because of swollen
	fingers, removes her ENGAGEMENT RING.

	EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER

	A ready-and-waiting HELICOPTER is on the pad.  Novak races
	out of the Center, Ramsey right behind him, SHOUTING at each
	other in order to hear above the chopper noise.

				RAMSEY
		Pete, listen to me.  What did you really
		learn in there?  Anything new?  You
		really think Stargher gave you a save
		the-day clue?  What if this is all some
		kind of trick your head is playing on
		you?

	He won't consider that.  Novak climbs into the helicopter and
	buckles himself in.  He looks to Ramsey - you coming? -
	Ramsey pats the side of the chopper and signals for the pilot
	to take off.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	Henry analyzes voluminous print-outs from the last procedure. 
	Although his eyes are on the data, he converses with
	Catherine in the PROCEDURE ROOM via intercom.

				HENRY
		...there was a moment when we thought
		we'd lost Agent Novak as well.

	We see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the
	procedure, but Henry is oblivious.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		His post-procedure consciousness
		recovery was remarkably quick.  Never
		saw that before.  Hey, remember that one
		time...

	He JUMPS when the door to the procedure room SEALS SHUT and
	mechanisms HUM.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		Catherine?

	When he looks through the window, Catherine is again
	suspended, the procedure under way.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing?

	He types in a command, but nothing happens.  He tires again.
	On another keyboard, but gets no response.  When he looks at
	the "map" screens, he sees something odd.  It's a small
	change, but it makes all the difference in the world.
	
			INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Like a rock climber in a crevasse, Julia shimmies up the
	walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using
	her hands and feet to push up.  The tile is slippery and each
	movement precarious.

	She uses strength and balance to reach a position just below
	the Plexiglass, the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie
	intense glow.  She sees a gap between the glass and the wall
	and uses her ENGAGEMENT RING to dig into it, SCAPE, SCRAPE,
	SCRAPING with the diamond.

	THE SHOWER SPRAYS WATER!  Julia nearly loses her balance, but
	manages to stay pressed into the corner.  She kicks the
	shower head, sending the spray as far from her as possible,
	and continues to dig at the caulking around the light
	fixture.

	IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, we see something unexpected.  The
	clock reads 00:00:00.  That water isn't going to stop.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM

	Miriam and Ramsey return to the lab to find Henry anxiously
	observing from the console.

				HENRY
			(flustered)
		She changed the codes.

				MIRIAM
		What's wrong?

				HENRY
		It would take hours to re-route the
		system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.

				RAMSEY
		What are you talking about?

	Miriam analyzes the situation and regretfully, angrily,
	worriedly realizes what's happened.

				MIRIAM
		She's done it.  Stupid, stupid girl...

				RAMSEY
		Done what?

				HENRY
		Instead of going into his mind...

				MIRIAM
		She's bringing Stargher into hers.

	ENTRANCE FOUR

	INT. CATHERINE'S WORLD

	A bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of
	things we saw in Catherine's home.  Unusual trees, rock
	formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant POOL OF WATER.

	The pond ripples.  Visible through the crystal-clear water is
	YOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim
	suddenly breaking through to air.  Panicked, he scrambles to
	shore and pulls himself to land.  Although the place is
	comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it
	frightens him.  Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this
	way and that.

				CATHERINE (O.S.)
		You're all right, Carl.

	The boy turns toward the voice and finds CATHERINE, her hair
	waving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a
	magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior
	goddess. 
	She opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the
	comfort of her embrace.  He shivers and she holds him
	tightly.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		It's okay, honey, you're with me now. 
		You're safe here.

	She looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I promised I would help you, and I
		always keep my promises.

				YOUNG STARGHER
		Can...

	Catherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak.  A
	sad, trembling little voice.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Can I stay here?

	She is touched that he would ask and strokes his face.

				CATHERINE
			(regretfully)
		Oh...no, honey, I'm sorry.  It's doesn't
		work that way.

	The boy breaks away from her, turning his back.  She gently
	takes his hand but he yanks it free.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		But what if I told you you could come
		visit?

	He slowly turns to her.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I'll make sure it happens, Carl.  I'll
		get them to let me do it.  And maybe...
		maybe we can...

	Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.  Over his
	shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool. 
	CENTIPEDES CRAWL over her legs and hair.  She stands and
	brushes them off.  The atmosphere grows darker and ominous.

				YOUNG STARGHER
		He found me...

	Catherine bristles as STARGHER KING RISES FROM THE POOL like
	a human serpent.  The brilliant colors of Catherine's world
	fade to GRIM TONES.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		He always finds me.

	Stargher King SCREECHES with anger and confusion.

				STARGHER KING
		Where thiisss att?!?!  Me god no like id
		here...

	He snarls when he sees Catherine.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		You.  Priddy bish-hor-kund.  You big
		trubble-mekker...
			(sneers at the boy)
		And you.  You cumm home now, liddle
		cogsugger worm.  Or me god haffa punish
		you...

	Young Stargher tightens his embrace of Catherine.  She steps
	back, away from the pond, hugging the boy tightly.

				CATHERINE
		No.!

				STARGHER KING
		No?!??!?!?!?

	Stargher King laughs.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		Hoo you thing you are?? Himm Muther?

	He comes close and reaches for the boy...

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		You gimme liddle worm.

	For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated. 
	Perhaps near an emotional breakdown.  But that is not the
	case.  She quietly lowers little Carl to the ground and
	whispers something in his ear.  As the boy nods, runs and
	hides, a ferocity grows within her.

				CATHERINE
		I said no.

	Like a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a
	BATTLE CRY!  STARGHER ATTACKS!  Arms reaching for her. 
	Catherine BLOCKS, PUNCHES, AND KICKS.  Stargher King doubles
	over.  Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her
	bent KNEE, breaking his nose.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Welcome to my world.

	As blood flows from his nostrils, Stargher King grins...

				STARGHER KING
		You funny.  You thing you stop me god?

	HE CHARGES.  At the right moment, Catherine sidesteps and
	SMASHES him in the ribs as he passes.  Stargher King crumples
	to the ground and she KICKS an uppercut to this chin.  Rising
	from the mud and muck, Stargher King lands a POWERFUL BLOW to
	her head, sending her flying.  He lifts the stunned Catherine
	with one hand and pulls her face to his...

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		You cum back wif me god.  You be good
		bish-hor-kund...

	Catherine looks into his soulless eyes.  Then SPITS in them
	and BITES his face!  She breaks free as he YOWLS with pain. 
	He steps toward her, but his feet don't move.  The earth
	itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like
	concrete.  Stargher King HOWLS with frustration.

				CATHERINE
		My world...

	A SHIMMERING KNIFE seems to enrage from within her forearm,
	out the flesh and into her hand.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		My rules.

	She SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood.

				YOUNG STARGHER (O.S.)
		No!

	Catherine stops.  And turns to see the distraught Young
	Stargher.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Don't hurt him!

	She spins around and sees not Stargher King, but MARTIN.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		He didn't mean it.  I was bad.

	Disturbed by the transformation, Catherine backs away.  Her
	vision blurs, the sound distorts.  And the earth cracks
	around Stargher King's ankles.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		He teached me a lesson.  I deserved it.

	Fighting feelings of disorientation, she kneels before the
	child and rests the knife on the ground.

				CATHERINE
		No one deserves it, Carl.  No one.

	She reaches out to him, but the child is JERKED into the air
	by Stargher King.  In one hand, the monster holds little
	Carl.  In the other - a KNIFE.  His face and chest red with
	crimson, Stargher King fixes his eyes on Catherine with a
	predator's stare.

				STARGHER KING
		Yer world.  My knife.

	Stargher King raises the blade toward the boy's throat and -
	SNAP!  The strong arms of an adult Stargher breaks his arm at
	the elbow.  Both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground
	as Stargher King YOWLS like a stuck pig, the good arm
	cradling the other.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		Me god hurt!  Why you do that?  Why?!

				STARGHER
		Enough.

	Stargher King regards him with disgust.

				STARGHER KING
		Enuff?!?!

	MARTIN STARGHER'S VOICE comes from the belly of the beast.

				STARGHER
		I'll tell you what's enough...

	Stargher and Stargher King square off.  The boy stands
	between them with the knife at his feet.

				CATHERINE
		Carl!

				STARGHER KING
			(still speaking as Martin)
		Shut up cunt.
			(to the boy)
		Give it here, worm...

	the child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking
	to Catherine for guidance.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
			(as Martin)
		You want a mommy?  Is that what you
		want?

	In an almost dream-like motion, the child hands the blade to
	adult Stargher.

				STARGHER
		Enough.

	And he DRIVES the thing into Stargher King's heart.  For a
	brief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher
	King's.  Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with
	sad, troubled eyes.

				MARTIN
			(as Stargher King)
		Why?  What'd I do?...

	Stargher TWISTS the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher
	King drops dead.   Dead.  Young Stargher smiles and hugs
	Catherine.

				YOUNG STARGHER
		Time to go 'way.

				CATHERINE
		Carl...?

	The boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his
	arms and holds him close.

				YOUNG STARGHER
		Bye.

	She looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand.  He
	descends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his
	shoulder.

				STARGHER KING
		Thank you, Catherine.  You did help me. 
		More than you'll ever know.

	Man and boy disappear beneath the water's surface.  Catherine
	stands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. 
	She walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher
	and little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. 
	And FADE FROM VIEW.

				CATHERINE
		Goodbye Carl.

	She presses the sensor in her hand.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Miriam is shocked by what she sees on
	the monitors and looks at Stargher.

				MIRIAM
		He's in full arrest.

	Catherine quietly returns to consciousness and is
	automatically lowered.  She pulls the mask from her face,
	rises and opens the door.  Miriam races inside and
	desperately attempts to revive Stargher.  But it's no use. 
	Angry and stunned, she demands of Catherine.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Help me!

	But Catherine chooses not to.  She knows Carl Stargher will
	never return to the world of the living.

	INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

	The chopper roars across the sky.  As they head northeast,
	away from the urban and toward the rural, Novak gazes out the
	window, trying to stay focused, fighting any after-effects of
	the drugs.  The pilot communicates via headset.

				PILOT
		Agent Novak?  Go ahead.

				NOVAK
		Cole?

	EXT. STARGHER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

	Cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting
	Suburbans.  (INTERCUT WITH NOVAK IN HELICOPTER).

				COLE
		The hoist was manufactured by Carver
		Industrial Equipment in 1982.  Serial
		number 117-337J.  Purchased by a boat
		shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to
		Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992...

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	The water is near the ceiling.  Kicking her legs to keep
	afloat, Julia DIGS with the ring and we see she has created a
	gap between the light fixture housing and an unused PIPE
	leading to the surface.  She pushes, but can't get anything
	to move.  The opening will get no bigger.  Julia sucks the
	last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell. 
	Searching for something, she finds a juice box and pulls out
	the drinking straw.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	Shaken, but oddly transcendent, Catherine watches as
	Stargher's body is wheeled out of the lab on a gurney.  She
	comforts a whimpering Valentine and tells him...

				CATHERINE
		Everything's alright now, Valentine.  I
		promise.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Novak scans the topography of FARMS below, listening to a new
	report.

	INT. SUBURBAN - DAY

	Cole is the passenger, on the radio to Novak, A DRIVER next
	to him, doing about a hundred down the Interstate, SIREN
	blaring.

				COLE
		Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named
		Bainbridge who tired to build a machine
		works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends
		up in bankruptcy court and the state
		winds up with the land - it's just
		sitting there.

	INTERCUT WITH NOVAK

				NOVAK
		Delano?

				COLE
		Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal
		up the place?

				NOVAK
		You're kidding me.

				COLE
		I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says
		I'm too serious.

	Novak locates Delano on the map.

				NOVAK
		The exact location, Cole.  Give it to
		me.

	The pilot grins and pushes the copper to top speed.

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Julia is entirely underwater but alive.  She uses the straw
	to suck oxygen through the gap in the ceiling, but it's
	difficult to tread water and her lungs are aching.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Novak uses binoculars to scan farmland.  He searches.  And
	there it is: The abandoned farmhouse!

				NOVAK
		TAKE IT DOWN!

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs
	against the walls, but as she does, the straw slips from her
	mouth.  She reaches for it, but only succeeds in pushing it
	away from her.  It heads for the drain.  And disappears.

	EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

	The helicopter lands and Novak jumps out.  He knows this is
	the place.  He runs into the barn, but there's nothing, no
	sign of her.  The pilot looks at him with a true sense of
	loss.

	INT. THE CELL - CONTINUOUS

	As Julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny
	holes of the drain, we see for the first time an expression
	which tells us she's given up.  THUMP-THUMP-THUMP.  The cell
	starts to vibrate.  A repetitive noise WHUP-WHUP-WHUP - comes
	from above.  She swims to the top of the cell and POUNDS at
	the ceiling.

	EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

	Fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs, Novak
	pushes on.  Think, Peter, think... His eyes find the WATER
	TANKS and he SHOUTS at the helicopter.

				NOVAK
		Cut the engine!

	As the motor dies, Novak listens and listens.  There it is. 
	Water pipes beneath his feet.  And very faintly, a pounding. 
	He follows the sound, searching the earth.  It's clearer now,
	louder.  Novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to
	assist him.  Together, they expose the entrance to the
	underground sanctuary.

	INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM

	Novak drops to the floor below.  Instantly affected by the
	similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of
	Stargher's mind, he feels another wave of dizziness, but
	pushes on.

	And is hit hard by the sight of DROWNED JULIA, her motionless
	body floating past him.  HER EYES OPEN and bubbles drift from
	her nose and mouth.  Novak BANGS on the Plexiglas and calls
	to her.

				NOVAK
		JULIA!

	The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. 
	Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass. 

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		MOVE ASIDE!

	He pulls his gun and takes aim.  Julia swims to the top of
	the cell and presses herself against the ceiling.  BANG-BANG
	BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.  Novak fires a circle of shots into the
	thick plastic.  Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is
	still solid.  He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the
	bullet-damaged section.  CRACK! CRASH!  WATER POURS FROM THE
	CELL.  Julia's body descends on the torrent of water.  Novak
	reaches inside and pulls her to safety.  He's just about to
	give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks
	in oxygen.  Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor,
	the water from the cell spilling everywhere.

	EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

	Cole's Suburban leads a contingent of FBI vehicles and local
	police cars onto the property, sirens blaring.

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Hearing the sirens, Novak relaxes.  For the first time in god
	knows how long, he relaxes.  And holds Julia Hickson as if
	his life depended on it.

										 FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

	Two cars parked outside.  An old, quirky Volvo and a Land
	Rover.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

	As a television plays THE WIZARD OF OZ, we find Catherine
	watching the movie from the couch, sitting up, drinking a cup
	of tea.  She looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a
	T-shirt, her CAT sleeping next to her.  IN THE KITCHEN,
	Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor,
	moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field
	of poppies...

				MIRIAM
		I left the nutritional information on
		the fridge door.  Read it.

	Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie. 
	Miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...

				CATHERINE
		I don't need them anymore...

				MIRIAM
		I know.

	But she leaves them just the same.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With
		dinner.

				CATHERINE
		Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...

				MIRIAM
		...give a kiss to Edward.

				CATHERINE
			(overlapping)
		Give a kiss to Edward.

	The women exchange smiles and Miriam exits.

	EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE

	As Miriam walks to her Land Rover, she sees a government
	issue Suburban park on the street and Peter Novak exit.

				MIRIAM
		Agent Novak.

				NOVAK
		Dr. Kent.

				MIRIAM
		You're looking well.

				NOVAK
		Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body
		good.
			(conspiratorially)
		I heard she got the approval to try the
		reversal with Edward.

				MIRIAM
		That's a secret.

				NOVAK
		Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. 
		We know all, see all...

	Novak opens the rear compartment of the Suburban and we hear
	something moving inside.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		How's the patient.

				MIRIAM
		Awaiting his arrival.

				NOVAK
		What about the cat?

				MIRIAM
		Completely unaware.

	Miriam's pager BEEPS and she hurries to her car.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I've got to go.  Good luck.

	Novak smiles, waves goodbye, and reaches into the Suburban.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE

	As Dorothy and her companions confront the Wizard, there's a
	KNOCK at the screen door and Catherine sees Novak waiting.

				NOVAK
		Ready?

	Catherine cradles her cat.

				CATHERINE
		Ready.

	He opens the door and escorts a leashed VALENTINE into the
	living room.  Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides
	under the couch.

				NOVAK
		That went well.

				CATHERINE
		Give her a minute.
			(smiles at the dog)
		Hello, Valentine.

	Novak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine,
	licking her face, wagging his tail.

				NOVAK
		You sure about this?

				CATHERINE
		Absolutely.
			(calling for the cat)
		Abigail...

	Valentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base
	of the sofa.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I heard Julia and John got married.

				NOVAK
		Yep.  Eloped.

				CATHERINE
		Good for them.

	Valentine settles on the floor.  Slowly, Abigail's curiosity
	gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's
	nose.  Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the
	cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort.

				NOVAK
		Well look at that.

				CATHERINE
		I told you.  You have to be optimistic. 
		Believe in them...

				NOVAK
		So you say.

	Amazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs.

				CATHERINE
		He's mine?

				NOVAK
		All yours.  My boss says it's one of the
		strangest requests the Bureau's ever
		had.

	Catherine laughs.  She likes that.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		He also says that until proven
		differently, Julia Hickson was found as
		a result of good old-fashioned detective
		work.

				CATHERINE
		It doesn't matter...

				NOVAK
		I don't know.  I think it does.
			(genuine concern)
		You know, Catherine... If you ever want
		to talk about it.  What happened to
		Stargher.  That last time.

	It's painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her.

				CATHERINE
		Not just yet.  Okay?

	Novak doesn't push it.  He just takes her hand and gives it a
	gentle squeeze.  The cat dashes into the kitchen and
	Valentine follows.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		They're hungry.

				NOVAK
		I got it.

	He moves into the kitchen.  In a moment of quiet
	introspection, Catherine looks at the television screen, at
	Dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked Witch with a bucket
	of water, causing her to melt.  And she looks away, unable to
	watch, disturbed by the image.  She turns to the kitchen and
	sees Novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat.  He rises and
	returns to the living room.

				CATHERINE
		Thank you.

				NOVAK
		No problem.

				CATHERINE
		No.  Thank you.

	He smiles and nods, gently resting his hand on her shoulder. 
	Catherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him, comforted by
	simple human touch...

							 FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:

	A SPECK OF DUST

	Grains of sand dance in the wind.  As we glide over a VAST
	DESERT, the speck of dust becomes a HORSE AND RIDER. 
	CATHERINE YOUNG straddles the beautiful black animal, her
	mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon.  A curious breeze
	blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if
	the wind itself were telling something to her...

	Catherine sees a FLICKERING LIGHT in the sand.  She pulls the
	reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into
	nothingness.  She dismounts, affectionately scratches the
	horse's neck, and follows the LIGHT.  When she looks over her
	shoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. 
	Not surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand
	sliding beneath her feet...

	She finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed,
	gnarled limbs appear to form hands.  The light dances across
	her face.  She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source...

	A SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a
	locket and chain.  It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy
	of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes.  He sits
	on a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival.

				CATHERINE
		Thanks for the horse.

	He's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine.

				EDWARD
		You liked him?

				CATHERINE
		He's beautiful...

	Edward smiles, delighted he made her happy.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		But I thought we were going sailing.

	The boy frowns.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		You promised.

	A devilish glint in his eye, Edward redirects the mirror. 
	Catherine follows the flicker to a TOY BOAT in the sand.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		We can't fit into that!

	Edward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her,
	then snaps the locket shut.  When her vision clears,
	Catherine sees a GIANT SHIP perched among the dunes.  A craft
	weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		That'll do.

	She walks toward it, but Edward doesn't follow.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
			(coaxing him)
		Come on, Mister E.

	She extends her hand, but he adamantly shakes his head no.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What now?

				EDWARD
			(nods at the ship)
		's broken.

	Undaunted, she... finds herself standing on the DECK.

				CATHERINE
			(calling to him)
		Who says?

				EDWARD
		Mocky-Lock.

				CATHERINE
		Oh no... No you don't.

				EDWARD
		"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock
		wants me where I am."

				CATHERINE
		I bet we can fix it.

	She opens a rusted iron DOOR.  It makes an HORRIFIC
	SCREECHING SOUND.  Similar to metal-on-metal, but more
	piercing, more pained.  As if made by a living thing.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
			(familiar with the noise, a
			warning to him)
		Ed-ward...

	The boy's FACE CONTORTS, turning into something half-human,
	half-animal.  A monster.  Mocky-Lock.  He SCREECHES, trying
	to frighten Catherine, but she cocks her head...

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		We agreed.  No more Mocky-Lock.

	The creature sticks its tongue out and DIVES.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Edward!

	But it's too late!  Edward/Mocky Lock slithers into the sand
	and disappears.  Resigning herself to a failure, she opens
	the palm of her left hand, revealing a SMALL BUMP in the
	flesh between thumb and forefinger.  She presses hard and...

	PICTURE AND SOUND DISTORT AND CHANGE

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	We are looking at a large SCREEN showing an electronically
	generated three-dimensional view of a human brain featuring
	color-coded neurological activity.  In a specific section of
	the image, cells flash from yellow to red...

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL HENRY WEST surrounded by computers,
	monitors, electronics, and keyboards.  DR. MIRIAM KENT stands
	before a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and
	images.  Both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip
	assemblers.  The impressive, weird computer system HUMS as it
	shifts programs, the unusual brain image changing colors.  

	THROUGH A LARGE WINDOW, we see into an ADJOINING ROOM within
	which a HUMAN FIGURE hangs suspended in mid-air by a series
	of cables designed to simulate flotation.

	AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of
	the touch-sensitive screen, changing the complex CHEMICAL
	SYMBOLS displayed there.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, a series of pharmaceuticals are
	injected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleeve/arm of
	the figure.  A featherweight cloth MASK electronically rises,
	revealing the sleeping face of Catherine.

	AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam hits a button and speaks into an
	intercom microphone.

				MIRIAM
		Sing a song of sixpence...

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, there is no reaction from Catherine.

				MIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Sing a song of sixpence...

				CATHERINE
			(hoarse, groggy)
		A pocketful of rye...

				MIRIAM (O.S.)
		Four-and-twenty blackbirds.

	Catherine's eyes open.

				CATHERINE
		Baked in a pie...

	IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Henry hits a switch and Catherine is
	lowered to the pedestal.  Miriam checks Monitors displaying
	Catherine's vital signs and continuing what must be a
	routine, presses numbers on a keypad to open the PRESSURIZED
	AIRTIGHT DOOR separating the two areas.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, lights come on and Miriam eases
	Catherine out of the apparatus.  She checks her pupil
	dilation, pulse, throat, and reflexes.  She pokes and prods
	with a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside
	observer, but is nothing to them.  Getting to her feet, we
	see that Catherine's BODYSUIT is made of an unusual dark
	fabric almost liquid in consistency.

	AT THE CONSOLE, Henry moves to another section and for the
	first time, we see there are two elaborate neural monitors. 
	And the "brain" pictured here is smaller.  Younger...

				HENRY
		"Mister E." is doing fine.

	REVEAL A SECOND FIGURE suspended from the ceiling in the
	PROCEDURE ROOM.  A SMALL BOY is lowered to the pedestal and
	as Miriam records data, Catherine removes the child's "mask,"
	displaying the haunted face of Edward.  Clearly, the boy is
	in some kind of catatonic state.

				MIRIAM
		Did we go sailing?

				CATHERINE
		Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.

				MIRIAM
		"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock
		wants me where I am."

				CATHERINE
		Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.

	Henry communicates with them via the intercom.

				HENRY
		Where did that come from again?

	Catherine looks annoyed - How could he forget?

				CATHERINE
		A nursery rhyme.

	Catherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body
	into a waiting wheelchair.  Miriam takes a penlight and
	examines the boy's eyes... An emotionless void, oddly
	beautiful.

				MIRIAM
			(thinking aloud)
		Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the
		bogeyman... All preparation for the
		horrors of the real world.

	Making certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him
	with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him
	into the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam.  Henry types in
	a command and moves to join them.

				HENRY
		Anybody hungry?  I'm hungry...

	A BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN... A constantly
	fretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them
	in the corridor.

				COOPERMAN
		Edward's parents are here.

	We can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news.

	EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

	Situated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego,
	California, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini
	compound.  A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A
	DIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY

	Although this is a hospital room filled with medical
	equipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys,
	posters, photographs, and drawings to make it more "homey." 
	(Some hint at aspects of Edward's fantasy world).  Every
	comfort has been provided and no expense spared.

	Henry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual
	clothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman.  Sitting
	on the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dressed
	woman in her mid-40's.  There is a soulfulness to her, but
	the husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor
	of a corporate tycoon.  One might write him off as cold, but
	we sense a genuine love for his wife and child.  Ella smiles
	and caresses Edward's hair.

				ELLA
		He needs a haircut.

				CATHERINE
		I'll tell the nurse.
			(sensing something in Edward)
		God, he loves when you visit.

				ELLA
		My husband wonders if that's true.
			(delivering bad news)
		He wants to place Edward in a hospital.

	Seeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate
	himself from Miriam and Catherine...

				HENRY
		There are other applications for the
		scanner, Mr. Baines...

				LUCIEN
		I realize that, Henry...
			(to Miriam)
		And I know your work, Dr. Kent, is
		invaluable to this company...

				CATHERINE
		You don't know about me, though, do you?

				LUCIEN
		Catherine, we've waited eighteen months
		for signs of progress...

				CATHERINE
		There's been progress.

				LUCIEN
		Yes, but there is no proof the procedure
		works.  All I have is a belief that your
		interaction with my son is not a
		hallucination.

	Catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the
	intensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must
	defend herself.

				CATHERINE
			(to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry)
		You picked me, remember?  And I took the
		job.  Gladly.  This is the next wave and
		I want to be part of it...

				COOPERMAN
		No one is doubting your ability.

				CATHERINE
		Then what is it?

	Introspective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then:

				LUCIEN
		I've invested millions of dollars in
		this study... And I've convinced others
		to do the same.  I suppose I should feel
		responsible to them, but I don't.  I
		could care less if they see a profit. 
		I'm responsible to my boy, that's all
		that matters.
			(looks her in the eye)
		You tell me... Am I doing the right
		thing?

	OFF CATHERINE'S FACE...

	INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

	At first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. 
	It's too bright, the space confining.  As our eyes adjust, we
	seem to be in a bathroom or shower stall.  We HEAR a WOMAN
	CRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY.  Dark circles
	beneath eyes red and puffy from crying.  Hair wet and ratted. 
	Sweater and pants damp and stained.  Barefoot, she shivers
	from cold and fear...

	PULL BACK to show more of her surroundings.  The white-tiled
	10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push
	button SPIGOT for drinking water.  Two walls are SOLID, the
	other two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic.

	The floor is littered with empty food wrappers - candy bars,
	juice boxes.  In the center of the floor is a DRAIN and above
	her, on the ceiling, a FLUORESCENT LAMP, also encased in
	clear plastic.

	There is no door.

	A mechanism CLICKS. Then a RUMBLING... Anne seems to know
	what's coming.  She presses against the wall, removes her
	arms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and
	raises the garment over her head, forming a tent.

	WATER ERUPTS from the shower head.  There is no steam, so
	this water must be cold.  Shaking, Anne whispers a count to
	herself - "One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three..." and
	so on.  The spray hits everything in the room - mirror,
	toilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain.

				ANNE
		Thirty.

	She peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped,
	and that isn't what she expected.  We hear a soft SUCKING
	NOISE and a CLICK.  The wrapper rises on a puddle of water. 
	Anne POUNDS her fist on the wall.

				ANNE (CONT'D)
			(angry, scared)
		THIRTY!

	A puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has
	somehow been sealed shut.  Her panic intensifies as we hear
	another CLICK and the water pressure increases.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	In the darkened procedure room, Miriam finds Catherine
	standing between the two suspension devices, alone.

				MIRIAM
		You okay?

	Catherine turns, nods, and tries to smile.  Has she been
	crying?  Miriam steps further into the room.

				CATHERINE
		He hates me.

				MIRIAM
		Lucien Baines?

	Catherine nods.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I wouldn't say "hates."  Dislikes,
		distrusts, maybe.

	Catherine laughs.  Exactly what Miriam wanted.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		She adores you.

				CATHERINE
		She thinks I can bring Edward back.

				MIRIAM
		Someday you can.  We all believe that...

	Catherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere,
	focused on the two apparatuses.

				CATHERINE
		I want to try it.  Please.

	Miriam knows what this is about.

				MIRIAM
		We've been over this a dozen times.  No.

				CATHERINE
		Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What
		harm could it do?

				MIRIAM
		I don't want to find out.

	Ever the doctor, Miriam finds herself surreptitiously
	examining Catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in
	her fingertips.

				CATHERINE
		Why is it taking so long for us to reach
		him?  Because we've been reactive,
		that's why.  And we need to be active.

	Miriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
			(annoyed)
		Miriam...

				MIRIAM
		Shush.

	As Miriam examines her, Catherine continues:

				CATHERINE
		He creates the obstacles, he decides
		which games to play.

				MIRIAM
		I've heard this argument before.  It's
		not happening.

				CATHERINE
			(frustrated)
		It could take years for me to get past
		the barriers he's created.

				MIRIAM
		If we reverse the feed and bring Edward
		into your mind, it could be devastating
		for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly
		existing in a whole other world.

				CATHERINE
		I do it all the time!

				MIRIAM
		Yes, but, you're a willing participant. 
		Picture Edward in a strange place, lost,
		frightened...

				CATHERINE
		I'd be there for him.

				MIRIAM
		And he might blame you for terrifying
		him.  That one moment could erase all
		you've accomplished.  And if that
		happened, the trust he has in you is
		gone.

				CATHERINE
			(defeated)
		Okay, okay...

	Miriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes.

				MIRIAM
		Besides, I don't know what it might do
		to you.  You're already exhausted.
			(concerned)
		Have you been sleeping?

	Catherine nods.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I can prescribe something...

	Catherine shakes her head no.  Miriam shuts off the penlight
	and looks at Catherine with professional and personal
	concern.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		You're sure?  Any more nightmares?

				CATHERINE
			(defensively)
		No.

				MIRIAM
		Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. 
		You're going to eat well, meditate,
		exercise, and watch mindless television.

				CATHERINE
		Yes mother.

				MIRIAM
		I don't want you up all night reading
		Edward's case file of the nine millionth
		time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. 
		Leave the work here.

	She taps Catherine's head.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Don't bring it home in this.

				CATHERINE
		Okay.

	Miriam gathers her belongings.

				MIRIAM
		Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese
		place he's wild about.  Want to come?

				CATHERINE
			(declining)
		I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I
		want to get to bed early.

				MIRIAM
		That's my girl.

	Miriam exits, but Catherine remains, still curious what could
	happen if things were reversed.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - HALLWAY - DAY

	The corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.  At
	the NURSES STATION, a staff member observes the child on a
	closed-circuit monitor.  Further down the hall, Miriam and
	Henry exit.  Wearing a (chic) thrift store coat and lugging a
	worn book bag, Catherine stands outside Edward's room,
	watching him sleep.

				CATHERINE
		Pleasant dreams, Mister E.

	EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

	A GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch
	of two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the
	speed limit.  He signals and exits...

	EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	The truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy, unpaved road. 
	The area is desolate, depressing, and deserted.  It feels
	like no one's been anywhere near here for years.  The pick-up
	stops at a RUSTED GATE and the DRIVER, a tall, lean, sinewy
	fellow undoes a combination lock-and-chain.  We do not yet
	see his face.

	EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY

	The truck parks inside a charred barn, now hidden from view,
	and the driver steps out, followed by his DOG.

	A magnificent WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD.  We notice a GLINT in
	its BLUE EYES - the animal's an albino.  The driver points
	and whistles.  Well-trained, the Shepard sprints to the gate
	and waits, keeping a watchful eye on the road.

	INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	From the outside, a passerby would never know this sanctuary
	existed.  Within the foundation of a farm building never
	completed, we find a small room in the center of a much
	larger space.  The cell.  We hear the WHIR of ELECTRONIC
	EQUIPMENT and notice VIDEO CAMERAS mounted on tripods pointed
	at the two-way glass.  We follow CABLES to a massive VIDEO
	RECORDER - the type used in surveillance, able to record for
	days without maintenance, and an elaborate TIMING DEVICE
	connected to a series of VALVES and SWITCHES.

	As if in a beatific trance, the driver moves to the window
	and gently rests his palm on the glass.  ANNE MOVES!  Arms
	flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread.  The last
	spark of life... The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.

	Almost shamefully, he turns and hides, unable to look at her. 
	Suddenly, his body tenses and writhes, as if seized by
	torturous pain.  He opens his mouth in a silent scream.

	And then, quickly as it came, the pain subsides.  Hidden in
	shadow, he breathes deeply, regaining self-control.  He
	waits, then moves back to the glass.  Anne's dead face floats
	past him.  Almost angelic.  He watches her and leans his head
	against the window, closer.  And the driver catches his own
	reflection in the mirror.

	Meet CARL STARGHER.

	EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Small and isolated, the nearest neighbor a block away.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The place is a mess.  Computer print-outs, dirty dishes,
	unopened mail, videotapes, and notepads cover tables, chairs
	and floor.  On the crammed bookshelves, psychology texts sit
	next to volumes on mythology, religion, and the occult. 
	Totems, figurines and artifacts (Central and South American
	in origin) adorn the walls and tables.

	As Portishead plays on the stereo, we find Catherine
	suffering from insomnia, wearing goofy-yet-hip eyeglasses,
	sweatpants and a UCSD T-shirt, sharing a late-night snack
	with her pet CAT.  She shuts the refrigerator door and we
	linger on an odd POSTCARD taped to the surface.  A kitschy
	postcard of a warrior/goddess.

	INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

	We MOVE out of shadow, toward a bright focused light,
	following the albino German Shepherd - VALENTINE - as it
	enters a VAST SUBTERRANEAN ROOM.  Most of the walls have been
	knocked down, leaving only thick support posts.  Valentine
	finds Stargher in a DUGOUT PIT - about five feet deeper than
	the rest of the room - polishing a stainless steel table.  A
	bright tungsten work light hangs above, and near it is the
	chain, cables and hooks of a customized MECHANICAL HOIST.

	The dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far
	corner where there are empty jugs of BLEACH sitting next to a
	long, deep cast iron TUB.  Stargher WHISTLES and Valentine
	obediently retreats to a KENNEL CAGE.  Stargher gives him a
	chew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub.

	Soaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey. 
	The interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and
	the whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is
	floating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are
	her eyes.  Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into
	something ghostly, they are unforgettable.

	As the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne
	from the tub and carries her to the table.  He places her
	face up and dries her with a clean white towel.  He moves her
	limbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then
	retreats into shadow.  In the harsh light, against the shiny
	table, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and
	we almost expect her to move...

	We HEAR Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the
	pool of light.  Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is
	laced with some rough tatoos.  When he turns his back to us,
	we find EIGHT METAL RINGS, thick and strong, PIERCED through
	his flesh.  Two columns of four on either side of the spine,
	running from shoulder blade to just below the waist.  What in
	God's name are they for?

	Stargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where
	he keeps TELEVISION MONITORS and VCRs.  He inserts a
	videocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches
	the screen.

	In BLACK AND WHITE, we see Anne awaken in the cell.  Her
	first moments inside.  Disoriented, terrified, trapped, she
	examines her surroundings.

	Stargher is mesmerized by her fear.  Fast-forwarding to her
	death, he presses a remote and we get SOUND.  Anne screaming,
	begging for her life.  Aroused, stimulated, Stargher drinks
	it in like a symphony.  Valentine cowers in the back of his
	cage, hating this.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Lying on her bed (a waterbed), Catherine sleepily stares at
	the ceiling, rolls onto her side, and feels herself drawn
	into the comforter.  The folds of the fabric become ripples. 
	Ripples become dunes.

	EXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY

	And we find ourselves in the DESERT of EDWARD'S WORLD.

	We fly over dunes and come up behind Catherine as she
	struggles through waves of sand.  The tree trunk is up ahead
	and we glimpse someone hiding inside.

	Catherine reaches.  MOCKEY-LOCK ERUPTS FROM WITHIN THE TREE
	TRUNK!  SNARLING!  Catherine retreats, silently screaming.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN

	IN HER OWN BED, Catherine's eyes are open.  In sharp contrast
	to a typical reaction to a nightmare, she remains calm.  No
	sweaty face, no gasp, no reaction at all, really.  She might
	as well have been dreaming of puppy dogs.  Wide awake, her
	eyes return their gaze to the ceiling.

				CATHERINE
		Go.  To.  Sleep.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

	CHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. 
	Admiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings
	in his back.  He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters,
	a series of GEARS click into motion.  The sound is torturous
	as the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground,
	pulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising.  Stargher
	grimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it.  As the
	hoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the
	table until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's.

	In the flickering weird light of the television screen,
	Stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of
	William Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an
	innocent angel.  With his free hand, he touches himself,
	chains clinking and swaying.

	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

	A railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek
	bed.  Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER,
	CRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI.  A SEDAN travels down a
	service road and stops nearby.  TWO MEN exit, identify
	themselves as FBI and move to the crime scene.

	Special Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself
	on professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. 
	Special Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges,
	introspective, and intense.  A loner who marches to the tune
	of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with
	probing eyes.  He moves slowly, observing the scene - the
	world, for that matter - from a unique perspective.

	As Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak
	oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the
	air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.

				RAMSEY
		Who found her?

	Cole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car.

				COLE
		Surveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six
		this morning.

	Novak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by
	wire.  Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI
	PATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE "TEDDY" LEE, a polite, dapper
	southern gentleman.

				NOVAK
		Thanks for waiting, Teddy.

	Teddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - "My
	pleasure."  Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER
	and assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick
	clear plastic.  As the photographer reacts to a strong smell,
	Teddy comments.

				TEDDY LEE
		Bleach.

	As the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them.  Sadly,
	Novak recognizes the face.

				NOVAK
		Anne Marie Vicksey.

	We recognize her, too.

				COLE
		She the one from Santa Cruz?

				NOVAK
		Just graduated law school.  Single mom. 
		Had a two-year-old daughter.

	He and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither
	man surprised.  Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the
	killer's tell-tale signs.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
			(instructing the photographer)
		The semen on her legs and abdomen.

	FLASH! Photos are taken.

				TEDDY LEE
		Someone looking after her little girl?

				NOVAK
		Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.

	Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying
	to imagine the horrors she beheld.  He moves to the creek and
	sees only a few inches of water.  His eyes move from the drop
	site to the highway above.

				TEDDY LEE
		The poor thing.

	FLASH!  We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the
	photographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft
	shoulder.  Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene,
	steps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the
	killer's truck as it disappeared into the night.
	
	
	
	EXT. OFFICE PLAZA - DAY

	 A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN, JULIA HICKSON, shares lunch with her
	fiancee, JOHN TRACY.  They talk, laugh and kiss, not a care
	in the world.

	INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

	As TALK RADIO plays, Carl Stargher watches them, specifically
	Julia, his eyes never off her for too long as his hands work
	on something banal but unseen.

				TALK RADIO HOST
		...complaining about government
		subsidies for farmers...

	The voice on the radio becomes DISTORTED as we hear it
	through Stargher's ears...

				TALK RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
		...but without subsidies, families will
		starve, and I'm nodd
		exagggeerrrrr....ayding.  Iff id werrrr
		up tooooo meeeee.....

	The host's voice fades into a guttural, monstrous groan.

				TALK RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
		Meeeee gawwwwwdd Caaaarrrrlll.  Mee god
		cum...
			(returning to normal)
		Meeeee....wwuuuuuddunnnnttttt... be
		spending billions on other countries
		when we've got problems right here.

	He opens his eyes and watches John kiss Julia goodbye as she
	returns to work.  Stargher looks down and we see what he's
	been working on - A TOY DOLL.  Female.  Stripped of its
	clothes, a single metal ring stuck through its plastic neck.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	His lunch finished, Ramsey is on a cell-phone talking to his
	wife.  Chain-drinking coffee, Novak scrutinizes photos of the
	tire tracks.

				RAMSEY
		Well, honey, what's worse?  Doing it
		yourself or asking your mother for help?
			(gets his answer)
		Can it wait 'til I get back/
			(listens, answers)
		I have no idea, Jeannie.

	Novak checks his watch and the street.  Clearly waiting for
	someone or something.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		Well all right.  Good luck with the
		Monster.  I love you too.  Bye-bye.

	Ramsey snaps shut the cell-phone.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		We call Jeannie's mother "The Monster"
		because, well... she just is.

	Novak is oblivious, pouring over tire-related info.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		I know you could care less about my
		personal life, Peter, but I do
		appreciate the occasional, "How's your
		wife, Gordon?"

	He waits.  Novak obliges:

				NOVAK
		How is she?

				RAMSEY
		Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.

	Novak is distracted by Teddy Lee entering the diner.

				NOVAK
		Here he is.

				RAMSEY
		Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner
		tells you his wife's gonna have a baby,
		and all you care about is a coroner's
		report!

	Ramsey assesses the exhausted, lonely, intense man sitting
	across from him.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		I feel for those girls too, Pete.  And
		their families.  But it's just a job. 
		Someday it'll be over.  And then what'll
		you have?

	Much to Novak's appreciation, Teddy Lee's arrival provides an
	escape from answering the question.

				TEDDY LEE
		Hot off the presses.

	He gives them copies of the AUTOPSY REPORT and FORENSIC
	ANALYSIS of Anne Marie Vicksey.  The WAITRESS sees Teddy,
	approaches, and offers a menu.

				TEDDY LEE (CONT'D)
			(doesn't need it)
		Chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes,
		garden salad with Thousand Island
		dressing and an iced-tea.  Thank you
		darlin'.

	She nods and moves to the kitchen.  Novak and Ramsey flip
	through the documents.

				TEDDY LEE (CONT'D)
		Water in her lungs.  Same brand of
		bleach.  Match on the semen.  Lots of
		hair.

				RAMSEY
			(unenthused)
		More hair.  I could knit this guy a
		toupee.

	Novak finds something in the report that catches him by
	surprise.  He double-checks and shows the item to Teddy.

				TEDDY LEE
			(reading)
		So?

				NOVAK
		Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.

	Ramsey checks his copy.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		I need it.

				TEDDY LEE
		Now?

				NOVAK
		Now.

	INT. FORENSIC LABORATORY - DAY

	A MONITOR shows a SINGLE HAIR under a video microscope. 
	Teddy Lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view.

				TEDDY LEE
		Complete absence of melanin.

	Novak and Ramsey stand over his shoulder.

				RAMSEY
		And that means?

	Teddy moves aside and takes another bite of his lunch
	(chicken fried steak now carry-out).

				NOVAK
		The dog's an albino.
			(pictures it)
		He'd love an animal like that.

				TEDDY LEE
		Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is
		rare indeed.

	INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

	Exiting an elevator, Julia heads for her little Toyota. 
	Smart girl that she is, her eyes scan the area and her
	fingers hold a can of mace.

	INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT

	Julia climbs in, checks her mirror and backs up.  WHAM!  Did
	she hit something??  She brakes, puts the car in park, and
	checks her sideview mirror.

	Reflected there is a WOUNDED DOG.  A white German Shepherd. 
	She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing
	whimpering.

				JULIA
		Oh no...

	INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

	Julia exits her car and kneels next to Valentine, who appears
	to be in terrible pain.

				JULIA
		God... I didn't see you.

	STARGHER'S HANDS COME AT HER FROM BEHIND!  One grabs her hair
	and the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. 
	He presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move.  After a
	brief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her
	until she passes out.  Stargher pushes Julia into the
	passenger seat and starts the car.  Pulls a dog treat from
	his pocket and WHISTLES.  The Shepherd instantly perks up. 
	Perfectly healthy.  And jumps into the car.

				STARGHER
			(feeds him a treat)
		Good boy.

	INT. RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

	In a BRIEFING ROOM we find Teddy Lee, Ramsey, Cole and local
	cops.  All in need of caffeine.  They complain, gossip, and
	shoot the shit.  Resembling a demanding professor, Novak
	enters and through presence alone, lacking any self
	consciousness about his dishevelled appearance, takes control
	of the room by holding up a PHOTOGRAPH of a young woman.

				NOVAK
		Donna Krozin.
			(a new picture every time)
		Helen Francis, Teresa Manicki...

	The chatter dies.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Antoinette Simms, Natalie Pagels, Grace
		Cassatt... Anne Vicksey.

	Every person is solemn and focused.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Smart, gentle, attractive young women. 
		Just starting out in life. 
		Embarking on careers, going to school,
		getting married...

	He's hooked them.  The victims, these women, now mean
	something to them.  With great effect, he holds up grisly
	post-mortem photos.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		They were killed.  Kidnapped, tortured,
		and murdered.  By a white male.  About
		30-years old.
			(significantly)
		Who owns an albino dog./

	Everyone knows this is a real clue and awareness is
	heightened.  Ramsey chimes in.

				RAMSEY
		A purebred German Shepherd.

	Novak shows them a picture of a WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD taken
	from a resource on the Internet.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		Breeders typically destroy albino pups,
		so this animal is truly unique.

				NOVAK
		Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. 
		Forensics found dog hair in her car, but
		they had a K-9 unit at the scene and
		never had it checked.

				TEDDY LEE
		The Phoenix office tested that hair
		thirty minutes ago.  And we got the
		match.

				NOVAK
		It's his dog.

	Ramsey holds up a thick list.

				RAMSEY
		Registered breeders of German Shepherds.

	The list is long and a few of the cops GROAN.  Novak silences
	them with a fierce look that says, "I will not rest until
	this man is found and neither should you."

				NOVAK
		Be thorough, but be fast.  This guy's
		accelerating. 
		He only waited six days this last time. 
		When he started, two months could pass.

	A DESK SEARGENT enters the room and hands a FAX to Ramsey. 
	Novak is curious about it, but continues.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		This can mean different things.  He
		thinks we're stupid and can't catch him. 
		He's having fun and needs more.  Or...
			(thinking it through)
		This dog hair thing is sloppy.  The body
		this morning was found in less than
		three inches of water.  He knew we'd
		find her.  He wants to be caught.  But
		if we can't stop him...

	Gravely concerned, Ramsey moves across the room.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
			(dreading what's on that fax)
		...he can't stop himself.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

	Stargher, the awful PAIN eating away at his skull.  He
	searches the medicine chest.

				DISTORTED VOICE
		Me god feed on pain.

	The VOICE echoing inside his skull.

				DISTORTED VOICE (CONT'D)
		Pain good.  Cumm home to meee...

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

	Struggling to stay on his feet, he moves to the KITCHEN. 
	Valentine paces nervously, whimpering concern.  Stargher
	reaches for a bottle of vodka but falls to the floor. 
	Valentine BARKS, but gets no reaction from master.  We MOVE
	IN on Stargher's unblinking eyes.

				DISTORTED VOICE
		Go sleep Carl.  Me god wake up now.

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Julia Hickson finds the snack foods, drinking spigot, toilet,
	shower, and drain.  Her bare feet try to adjust to the tile
	floor, but it's fucking cold.  She glimpses herself in the
	mirror and is startled by what she sees - a terrified girl.

	INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

	A TAN SEDAN sits in the driveway of this modest middle-class
	home.  A VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR sits nearby, a deputy
	keeping watch.

	INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

	A distraught middle-aged couple, MR. AND MRS. HICKSON, sit on
	the couch of their living room.  FAMILY PHOTOS show them with
	Julia, whose fiancee, John, does his best to comfort the
	mother.  Novak and Ramsey have the unfortunate task of
	interviewing them about their daughter's disappearance.

				RAMSEY
		She was still living at home?

				MR. HICKSON
		Yes, sir.

				JOHN
		We were looking at apartments.

				MR. HICKSON
			(important they know)
		But nobody was moving in together 'til
		after the wedding.

	Novak hasn't said much.  Instead, he looks at something in
	his hands - a plastic evidence bag containing the TOY DOLL.

				RAMSEY
		John, you came to pick her up when?

				JOHN
		Eight o'clock.  We were going out for my
		birthday.

				MR. HICKSON
		Maybe you made a mistake.  Maybe she...
		she...

	Novak hides the doll.

				RAMSEY
		No sir.  I'm sorry.

	Ramsey's cell-phone rings and he excuses himself to a corner
	of the room, leaving Novak alone to deal with this
	uncomfortable, sad situation, no one saying a word until an
	emotionally shattered Mrs. Hickson, fingering a rosary, feels
	compelled to tell him.

				NOVAK
		After three years she remembers what the
		guy drove?

				RAMSEY
		She remembers because it was her "dream
		truck."  Wanted one just like it.

	EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - DAY

	Ramsey and Novak exit a small jet and are met by FBI Agent
	STOCKWELL.

				STOCKWELL
		Ramsey, Novak?

	They nod and he directs them to a waiting GMC SUBURBAN.

				STOCKWELL (CONT'D)
		Agent Stockwell.

				NOVAK
		Where is he?

				STOCKWELL
		Edison.  Just east of Loma Park.  SWAT's
		had the house under surveillance for
		about twenty minutes.
			(info memorized)
		Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher.  No
		registered weapons, no priors.  Got a
		license for his dog, though.  Named him
		Valentine...

	INT. GMC SUBURBAN - DAY

	Stockwell is behind the wheel, racing down the highway. 
	Ramsey's in the passenger seat, Novak in back.  Shotguns and
	body armor line the cargo area.  Novak's eyes target the FAX,
	a copy of Stargher's license and registration, and the grainy
	dot-matrix image of the suspect's face.  And Novak knows he's
	found him.

				NOVAK
		You're the bad man, aren't you, Carl?

	EXT. STARGHER HOUSE/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	A sparsely populated lower-middle class neighborhood.  A half
	dozen plain houses at the end of a cul-de-sac.  Bare trees. 
	Brown lawns.  Crows in the air.

	The house furthest from the main road has a white Ford F250
	pick-up in the driveway.  Green trim.

	THE SUBURBAN, hidden from Stargher's house, four-wheels it
	through a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a
	PRESCHOOL, where two more Suburbans and a van already wait.

	INT. PRESCHOOL - DAY

	Stockwell introduces Ramsey and Novak to BROCK, leader of the
	FBI Tactical Unit, a calm, confident ex-Marine wearing a
	black uniform and body armor.

				BROCK
		Glad you could make it.  We lose the sun
		in half an hour.

	Novak and Ramsey join him at the shaded window to observe
	Stargher's house.  Children's drawings fill the wall.  As
	Brock explains, Novak checks with binoculars.

				BROCK (CONT'D)
		Perimeter's two-hundred yards around the
		house.  Three men at the rear, two on
		each side, four up front.  I've got two
		marksmen on the roof.

				NOVAK
		Have they seen him?

				BROCK
		No.  There's been movement in the
		kitchen.  But it could be the dog.
			(important)
		You think she's in there?

	Novak is careful with his answer.

				NOVAK
		We proceed assuming she is.

				RAMSEY
		Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him
		he's got company.

				NOVAK
		No.
			(to Brock)
		Can you get a man close?

	EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

	Quiet.  Calm.  And then we catch a glimpse of a FIGURE
	advancing, using any cover he can, until he is right outside
	the house.  The sneaky SWAT team member, ERICSON, whispers
	into his throat mic.

				ERICSON
		I'm at the back door.

				BROCK (V.O.)
			(in Ericson's earpiece)
		Check the kitchen.

	Ericson maneuvers his way to the kitchen window and uses a
	MIRROR to sneak a peek.  In the REFLECTION we see a
	motionless man lying on the floor.

				ERICSON
		I have a man down.  Repeat, man down.

				BROCK (V.O.)
		Stargher?

	Ericson chances a quick visual check and pops his head up
	before reporting.

				ERICSON
		Can't see his face.

	INT. PRESCHOOL - DAY

	Brock looks to Novak, urgency and tension mounting.  Novak
	knows how much is riding on this specific moment.  All the
	various outcomes.  And decides.

				NOVAK
		Go.

	EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

	The SWAT TEAM SWARMS towards the house.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

	ERICSON KICKS IN THE BACK DOOR.  GUN READY!

				ERICSON
		FBI!

	He and THREE OTHERS rush inside!

	BAM!  FOUR MEN KICK in and proceed through the FRONT DOOR!

				SWAT TEAM MEMBER
		FBI!

	An odd quiet is all they encounter.  IN THE BACK, Ericson
	moves through a LAUNDRY ROOM and finds VALENTINE hiding
	behind a pile of dirty clothes, frightened by these masked
	figures in black.

				ERICSON
			(into throat mic)
		I've got the dog!

	He points for someone to secure the animal and MOVES into the
	KITCHEN, aiming his gun at the man on the floor, finally
	getting a look at his face.

				ERICSON (CONT'D)
			(recognizing him)
		Carl Stargher!  Do not move!

	No problem there.  Stargher appears lifeless.  As various
	SWAT team members secure the house, Ericson removes his mask
	and CUFFS Stargher, startled at the sight of the horrible
	RINGS piercing his back.

				ERICSON (CONT'D)
		Jesus Christ...

	EXT. PRESCHOOL/STARGHER'S HOUSE - DAY

	As an AMBULANCE emerges from a hiding place behind another
	garage, we FOLLOW NOVAK and RAMSEY as they run from the
	preschool into the house.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE

	As a K-9 UNIT secures Valentine, Novak storms into the
	kitchen, checks Stargher for a pulse and barks at SWAT>

				NOVAK
		Paramedics.  NOW.

	Ramsey pushes through and Novak informs him.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		He's alive.

	EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

	FBI AGENTS and local police cordon off the area.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

	Valentine is muzzled and led away as the PARAMEDICS load
	Stargher onto a stretcher.  Agent Stockwell turns to a
	worried Novak.

				STOCKWELL
		They'll take him to County General. 
		Reid's already there.

				NOVAK
		Make sure he stays cuffed.  Two men on
		him at all times.  I don't want anyone
		treating him but Reid.  Not so much as a
		thermometer up his ass.  Understand?

	Stockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside.  A stoic
	Ramsey enters from the living room and Novak can see the
	disappointment in his eyes.

				RAMSEY
		She's not here.

	Novak would give anything for that not to be true.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
			(it gets worse)
		You should come downstairs.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

	Ramsey leads Novak into Stargher's "workroom."  It's all
	here, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach.  An odd,
	grisly collection of DOLLS fills cubby holes in a wooden
	storage/shelf unit.  Novak's eyes are like a camera,
	documenting and storing as much information as possible, but
	it's overwhelming.

	He moves through the basement.  Careful not to touch
	anything.  He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks
	situated over the stainless steel table.  (NOTE: ON THE
	WINCH'S MOTOR IS A WORN PLAQUE READING "CARVER INDUSTRIAL
	EQUIPMENT" with a logo).

	Ramsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills
	with images of Anne dying in the cell.

	Novak is painfully, tragically drawn to this.  Although he's
	seen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed
	by the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly
	dying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia
	Hickson unless he finds her.

	INT. THE CELL - NIGHT

	CLICK.  WATER SPRAYS FROM THE SHOWER.  Caught by surprise,
	Julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut
	off valve.  Of course, there is none.  Thirty seconds later,
	the water stops.  Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's
	eyes dart around her "cage."  What kind of hell is this? 
	Shivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply
	into it.  Something's odd about the glass.  Is someone
	watching her?  She bangs on it with her fist.

				JULIA
		Hey!

	POUND, POUND, POUND!

				JULIA (CONT'D)
		LET ME OUT!!!

	But there's no response.  Only her reflection.

	INT. KERN COUNTY HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

	A HUMAN EYE.  No movement, no deviation of the iris.  A fixed
	stare.  The catatonic Stargher lies in a hospital bed, wrists
	cuffed to the frame.  An IV feeds him fluids and monitors
	report his vital signs.  As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO
	POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.  Novak, Ramsey
	and Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by DR.
	MILTON REID, a brilliant forensic M.D. currently shining an
	opthalmoscope into Stargher's eyes.  He pulls away and checks
	the ELECTROENCENPHELOGRAM already on a lightbox.

				REID
		Minimal activity in the dorsolateral
		prefrontal cortex.  And here, the
		anterior cingulate cortex.
			(to Novak and Ramsey)
		It's what helps distinguish between
		external and internal stimuli.

				RAMSEY
		What the hell does that mean?

				TEDDY LEE
			(answering for Reid)
		He's schizophrenic.

	Novak doesn't like this.  Not one bit.

				RAMSEY
		What're you doing here, Reid?  Paving
		the way for his insanity defense?

				REID
		No need.  There won't be a trial.  This
		is no act.  The coma is real.

				RAMSEY
		Whoa.  Wait a minute.

				REID
		You ever hear of Whalen's Infraction?

	Clearly not.

				REID (CONT'D)
			(re: the EEG)
		In any schizophrenic, these areas would
		be affected.  But in someone with
		Whalen's, they're hit hard and hit fast.

	Novak's worry intensifies.

				REID (CONT'D)
		Stargher's neurological system was
		infected by a virus in utero.  It lay
		dormant.  In his case for about...
			(guesses at Stargher's age)
		...thirty years.  Most likely, he's
		exhibited symptoms for awhile now, but
		the infraction - the breach - didn't
		occur 'til today.  You never know when
		it'll happen, at what age, or why.  The
		triggers vary, but the results don't.
			(fascinated by Stargher)
		He has no ties to reality.  No awareness
		of this world or the people in it.

				TEDDY LEE
		What about Thorazine? Or... Desoxyn?

				REID
		The normal psychotropics don't work. 
		He's not just catatonic, he's...
		disappeared.  Like having a dream and
		never waking up.

				NOVAK
		This girl.  Julia Hickson.  Only he
		knows where she is.

				REID
		Then I'm sorry.  For her and for you.

	Novak is past angry.  He's bordering on devastation.  Ramsey
	attempts to placate him.

				RAMSEY
		We'll go back to his house, Pete. 
		There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the
		videos, track sales of the bleach, go
		through his records.  Maybe he owns
		property somewhere.

				NOVAK
		They're in that fucking thing for forty
		hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia
		at seven-thirty last night.  You know
		what time it is now...?!

	Ramsey backs off, knowing his partner is on the verge of
	really losing it.  Reid thinks perhaps he shouldn't, but
	sensitive to Novak's pain and anger, mentions it anyway - if
	only to keep his friend from true hopelessness.

				REID
		Peter?  This is a longshot.  I mean a
		real long shot.  You're gonna think I'm
		crazy...

	EXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY

	The ship's engine ROARS TO LIFE and the PROPELLER spins
	through sand.

				CATHERINE (O.S.)
		It's fixed!

	AT THE TREE TRUNK, Catherine extends her hand and suddenly
	Edward is there, quite close, reaching out.  Catherine's hand
	trembles.  The boy is startled.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
			(surprised, to herself)
		I'm not signalling...

	Her hand tenses and shakes uncontrollably.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Sing a song of sixpence...

				CATHERINE
			(angry, to the heavens)
		I'm not signalling!

	Edward is frightened by what's happening and runs away. 
	Catherine tries to call out, but her throat constricts,
	making speech difficult.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I'm not...
			
			
			
			INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	Catherine's face is covered by a cloth floating down from the
	sky.  The sky is replaced by the ceiling and overhead lights
	of the LABORATORY, but Miriam's face remains constant.  Now
	conscious, Catherine finds herself in the lab at the Campbell
	Center, the suspension device lowering.

				MIRIAM
			(on intercom)
		Sing a song of sixpence.

				CATHERINE
			(hoarse)
		A pocketful of fucking rye.
			(worried)
		What's wrong?

				MIRIAM
			(cagey)
		Nothing.

				CATHERINE
			(disappointed)
		Why did we stop?

	Cooperman appears in the window and explains.

				COOPERMAN
			(on intercom)
		I asked them to.
			(with gravity)
		We have a situation.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	A SMALL TV SCREEN shows footage of Anne drowning in the cell. 
	Catherine, Cooperman, Henry, and Miriam watch with curiosity,
	disgust, pity.  Novak and Ramsey flank the portable
	monitor/VCR, knowing this is a disturbing but powerful tool. 
	There's someone else in the room.  John Tracy.  He cannot
	watch the video, not again.  Catherine glances at him,
	uncomfortable with his presence.

				MIRIAM
		When did he lapse into the coma?

				NOVAK
		Sometime yesterday morning.

	John tries to keep his composure, but Novak's making this
	tough for him.  Novak wants the scientists to see, to
	understand the boy's pain.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Each tape is the same.  He provides
		food, drinking water, a toilet. 
		Periodically, a shower starts.  It's on
		some kind of timer - he's clever with
		machines, building things.  I think he
		wants them to believe this is a simple
		kidnapping.  That there's a possibility
		of rescue.  Of survival.  But it's just
		a form of torture.  At the end of the
		fortieth hour, the drain shuts.  The
		water starts and doesn't stop.
			(gravely)
		We've already lost more than a day.  If
		she isn't found tonight.  She dies like
		the rest.

				COOPERMAN
			(to Miriam, Henry and
			Catherine)
		John and Ella Baines - as well as the
		Sunerset Board of Directors - have given
		their approval, but the decision is
		yours.

				MIRIAM
		What about the legalities of this...?

				NOVAK
		Stargher is in custody.  The functional
		equivalent of being under arrest. 
		Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he
		didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. 
		But because of his condition, he doesn't
		have the capacity to waive those rights.

				HENRY
		So what you're asking us to do is
		illegal?

				NOVAK
		No, not at all.
			(explains)
		We're dealing with exigent
		circumstances.  Somewhere there's a
		kidnapped woman still alive.  If we
		weigh the suspect's Constitutional
		Rights against the public safety. 
		The Law favors the victim and gives us a
		lot of leeway.  It's called the Public
		Safety Exception.

				COOPERMAN
		So what can you do?

				NOVAK
		Pretty much anything we want.  There's a
		chance to save a human life.  Because of
		that, Stargher has no reasonable
		expectation of privacy.

	Miriam, Henry and Cooperman appear to be onboard.  Novak's
	made a persuasive, heartfelt argument.  Only one person still
	remains uncertain.

				CATHERINE
		What if...?

	All eyes turn to her.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What if he wasn't like this?  What if he
		was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would
		you go?

				NOVAK
		As far as I needed.

	Catherine nods, analyzes Novak's eyes, gestures, body
	language, and "interrogates" him.

				CATHERINE
		Do you think he'd tell you what you need
		to know?

	John's discomfort is increasing and Novak is sensitive to it.

				NOVAK
		There's always a chance they'll confess.

				CATHERINE
		Really?  I don't work with violent
		cases, I work with children.  But even a
		kid lies.  They love it when they get
		you to believe something that isn't
		true.  Don't you think Stargher would do
		the same?

				NOVAK
		Sometimes... Once they've been caught
		they feel a need for disclosure.  They
		have so much they want to tell. 
		But they've never had a sympathetic ear. 
		They need someone to understand why.
			(focusing on Catherine)
		Stargher used to hide the bodies very
		carefully.  It was part of the ritual. 
		Some weren't found for weeks and any
		physical evidence had been meticulously
		wiped clean.  But these last three...
		They were still in water - always in
		water - but
			(clarifies)
		Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It
		went beyond that...

				CATHERINE
		Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to
		find him, that some part of him hated
		what he was doing... Most likely, that
		part is dead.  Schizophrenics with
		Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with
		the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.

				RAMSEY
		Is it possible?

				CATHERINE
		If he came to trust me, yes, but it
		takes months to build that kind of
		trust.  Someone like Stargher can't
		distinguish between fantasy and reality. 
		It's all the same.  He might tell me
		she's in Timbuktu and absolutely, one
		hundred percent believe it to be true,
		but she's...

				JOHN (O.S.)
		Julia.

	They turn to John Tracy.  His vulnerable, barely audible
	voice forcing everyone to listen.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		Not "she."  Julia.  Not thing, or it, or
		her.  Do you know anything about her? 
		Do you know what we've been through? 
		Julia is everything to me.  Can you say
		that about anyone?  

	Catherine hangs her head.  And finds herself looking at
	photograph of the girl in question.  A smiling Julia Hickson
	looking right at her.

	WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  POUNDING REVERBERATIONS...

	EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

	WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP.  A HELICOPTER descends onto the pad. 
	A stretcher is removed from the side door of the helicopter.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - VARIOUS/TRAVELLING - DAY

	The STAFF watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a
	stretcher bearing the catatonic Stargher is wheeled FAST
	through the corridors by an FBI escort team.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	Hundreds of photographs, drawings, diagrams, maps,
	blueprints, and documents - Novak's case material - cover
	every inch of wallspace.  The table is littered with
	reference books, atlases, telephones, a fax machine, short
	wave radio, and computer/Internet terminal.  An FBI
	TECHNICIAN completes the electronics work and points out the
	"speed dial" functions to Novak and Ramsey.

				FBI TECH
			(listing them)
		Quantico.  San Diego Field Office. 
		S.D., L.A., and San Francisco P.D. 
		California, Arizona, Nevada State
		Police.  Nine and ten are open lines.
			(re: radio set up)
		Direct link to the chopper.
			(re: the computer)
		That gets you into the Bureau Database.

				NOVAK
		Thanks.

	Once he's gone, Ramsey takes this moment "alone" to question
	his partner.

				RAMSEY
		You sure you want to go through with
		this?

				NOVAK
		What else do we do?!

				RAMSEY
		I don't know, Pete, but for god's
		sake... This is nuts.  Do you really
		understand what they're going to do?

				NOVAK
		I don't have to.

				RAMSEY
		Why jeopardize what we've already done? 
		We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl
		Stargher.  That's going to be like
		Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes
		careers.  But if we push our luck.  If
		this is all bullshit and we come out
		smelling like it.

				NOVAK
		Tell you what.  If this thing burns us,
		I take that heat.  I give you permission
		to point your finger at me and say "It
		was all his idea."

				RAMSEY
			(offended)
		That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. 
		I'm talking about waking up and
		realizing this girl's gonna die.

	The words are anathema to Novak.

				NOVAK
		That won't happen.

	Cooperman appears in the doorway and informs them...

				COOPERMAN
		They're ready.

	Ramsey looks to his partner, but Novak is already on
	Cooperman's heels.  Resignedly, Ramsey follows.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	Cooperman guides Novak and Ramsey into the lab.  The FBI men
	are impressed, but neither is quite sure what to make it all. 
	The FBI escort team leader gets Ramsey's signature and Novak
	undoes the cuffs from Stargher's wrists and ankles. 
	Following Miriam's direction, the escorts guide the gurney
	carrying Stargher into the procedure room.  As Cooperman
	shows them out, Henry seals shut the door.  Miriam assumes
	responsibility for Stargher's care and checks his pulse, IV,
	pupil dilation, and vital signs...

				HENRY
		Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?

				MIRIAM
		They took care of that, thank you,
		Henry.
			(getting him out of her hair)

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Why don't you give our guests a little
		tour?

	Proud of his computer, but uncomfortable around strangers,
	Henry directs Novak and Ramsey to the console.

				HENRY
		Gentlemen, you stand before the one and
		only Neurological Cartography and
		Synaptic Transfer System.

	Although he's listening, Novak's eyes never really stray from
	his prisoner as Miriam uses safety scissors to cut away
	Stargher's clothes.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		It provides a highly detailed map of the
		human mind.  Not the brain - any MRI can
		do that.  The mind.
			(self-impressed)
		It reads and processes electronically
		allowing information to be transferred
		and interrupted.
			(for the laymen)
		Let's say your thoughts could be stored
		on DVD.  If someone had the right kind
		of player, they could watch and listen
		to what you're thinking.

	Novak observes Miriam as she "undresses" Stargher and Ramsey
	pokes around the lab.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		But we can't record or store the data. 
		The connections between nerve cells are
		constantly being modified.

	Miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars.  Henry
	continues, eager to focus attention back to him, but even he
	is fascinated by Stargher's skin.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		It's like the early days of television. 
		The subject sends out a live feed and
		you receive it during time of broadcast. 
		Whatever happens, happens.  All you have
		to do is "tune in."

	Miriam gives Stargher an alcohol bath, the clinical procedure
	taking on the quality of ritual.  Her wash cloth moves under
	Stargher's chin and over his face.  She's careful around the
	eyes and finds herself unable to look at them for long.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		But you do more than tune in... You
		become part of the snow.

	Catherine enters from a dressing area wearing the bodysuit. 
	Filled with curiosity, Novak watches Miriam and Catherine fit
	Stargher into his suit.

				NOVAK
		I still don't understand why I can't do
		this... This isn't some "troubled kid"
		you're dealing with.

				CATHERINE
		I realize that...

				NOVAK
		How hard could it be...?

	Catherine and Miriam try to hide their laughter.

				CATHERINE
		The first... What?  Six or seven times I
		went in.   Remember what happened?

				MIRIAM
		Disorientation, nausea, migraines,
		hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.

				CATHERINE
		Like a New Year's Day hangover.

				MIRIAM
		He needs to be turned over.

	Novak and Catherine roll Stargher onto his stomach.

				NOVAK
		This man is deeply disturbed, he...

				CATHERINE
		You don't know the procedure.

				NOVAK
		I know him.

				MIRIAM
		That may be true, but you don't have
		Catherine's gift.  She...
			(distracted by Stargher's back)
		What happened here?

	We see a series of EIGHT BANDAGES.

				RAMSEY
		We removed eight metal rings.

	Miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh.

				CATHERINE
		Then he should like this.

	Catherine connects Stargher to the SUSPENSION APPARATUS and
	it HOISTS him off the table.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		They're comforted by the feeling of
		weightlessness.  Like floating in water.

	Henry catches Ramsey poking his nose near a THIRD SUIT AND
	APPARATUS in the dressing area.

				HENRY
		Don't touch that, please.

				RAMSEY
		Sorry.

	Miriam prepares a series of CHEMICAL CARTRIDGES and loads
	them into a container connected to the IV-like tubes linked
	to the suspension device.

				MIRIAM
			(intimate, quiet)
		This isn't your responsibility. 
		Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt
		as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.

				CATHERINE
		I'll be fine.

				MIRIAM
		She said convincingly.

	Catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary
	connections.  Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring
	station.  She "locks down" the procedure room and joins
	Henry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console.

				NOVAK
			(eyes on the chemical/drug
			monitors)
		That's the stuff?

				HENRY
		About twelve years of research, right
		Miriam?

				MIRIAM
		Don't remind me.

				RAMSEY
		What is it - are they - exactly?

	That's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket.

				MIRIAM
		Psychostimulants, serotonin,
		stabilizers, meprobamate, Neurontin,
		lithium carbonate.  And my baby.  It
		duplicates and expands upon the effects
		of a chemical called oxytocin, forcing a
		break in the neuron connections that
		hold experience.  So new experience can
		form.

	Ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods, but Novak is
	fascinated.  Catherine presses the bump on her hand.  A RED
	INDICATOR LIGHT flashes on.

				HENRY
		There's a touch-sensitive microchip
		implanted in her hand.  If she becomes
		frightened, disoriented, or simply wants
		to end the session, she signals us to
		abort.

	Catherine presses again and the red light shuts off.

				MIRIAM
		Although none of what she experiences is
		real, she can be tricked into thinking
		it is.  The mind is awfully gullible, so
		she needs to monitor herself.

	Catherine and Stargher are suspended from the ceiling.  Henry
	types and the lights dim to a more somber, tranquil level. 
	Various screens flicker to life, displaying the vital signs
	of both "feed" and receive."  Miriam initiates the injection
	program.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you
		want me to wait, or...

				CATHERINE
		No.  No.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, we see chemicals mix with her blood,
	then feed the IV.  AT THE CONSOLE, as Henry types furiously
	at the computer keyboard, Novak asks Miriam:

				NOVAK
		You said she has a "gift."

	Overhearing, Henry interrupts, pointing at a section of
	Catherine's "mind map."

				HENRY
		Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in
		her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A
		genetic fluke.

				MIRIAM
		Catherine has a tremendous capacity for
		empathy.
			(clarifies)
		When we started, there were a number of
		test subjects - other therapists - who
		acted as "receivers."  All they did was
		observe and report.  Nothing more.  But
		Catherine, she had the ability to feel
		what was happening.  She understood. 
		And the patient responded.  Edward
		engaged her in dialogue, took her
		places, showed her things.  He knew she
		cared.

	A hopeful, solemn Novak gazes through the window, watching
	Catherine's body as it becomes parallel to Stargher's...

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine takes a deep breath and as
	the drugs take effect, feels herself losing consciousness. 
	She glances at Stargher, a man who tortures and kills women,
	then looks up as the CLOTH MASK descends from the ceiling.

				MIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Intravenous administration complete.

				HENRY (O.S.)
		Initiating connection.

	We follow fibrous wires running from Catherine's mask to
	Stargher's.  Their blood mixing with chemicals in the IV-like
	containers.  The computer system humming.

				HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Transfer begins 1100 hours, 34 minutes,
		12 seconds.

	Catherine's eye focuses on the mask.  As it comes closer, we
	see the lining is laced with thread-like wires and microchips
	forming hyper-miniature circuit boards.  Catherine's eye
	blinks.  The mask covers her face.  Catherine's eye shuts.

	Vision fades.  Darkness.  A faint light.  Microscopic veins
	in the eyelid become wires connected to chips.  And we're
	MOVING, into the circuitry.

	ENTRANCE ONE

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

	The pattern of the electronics grows into something more
	organic, textured, concrete.  Evolving into a world.  Black
	and shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of
	vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its
	core.

	Our journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we
	occasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism.

	INTERCUT with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness
	and fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the
	apparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world.

	There is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion
	and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with
	tiny fish and tadpoles.  At water's edge, lying on rough,
	pebble-strewn ground, is a HAND.

	Catherine's hand.  We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. 
	From the darkness comes a DOG.  Black in color and
	featureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders
	into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view.  After a
	moment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we
	follow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes
	it from her own face.

	IN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET
	sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED
	ANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just
	a TWIG.  As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the
	earth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools
	of stagnant water...

	As we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the
	world into which Catherine descended.

	She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to
	her surroundings.  The "floor" is covered with filth, ash,
	pebbles, and insects.  Water is present in many forms,
	puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings.

	Eyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," Catherine notices
	the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets
	showering the air.  She turns and finds the source.

	THE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full
	of BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his "bath."  Satisfied,
	the animal stops and trots away.  Still adjusting to this
	nightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but
	then realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING.  She looks
	around, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches
	sight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers.  As
	he disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we PULL BACK
	to show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace,
	walls, stairs, and ladders.  Leading everywhere and nowhere.

	Catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." 
	Shortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she
	moves to it.  We feel as though we're looking at a series of
	interlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been
	torn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or
	doors.  Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes
	her way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIGHTED ROOM

	A mottled HORSE stands with its head down, nose kissing the
	floor, allowing the BOY to caress its neck.  This sweet
	animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and
	Catherine approaches with respect.

				CATHERINE
		Hello?

	The frightened child retreats into a corner of the
	claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. 
	Surprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate
	step toward Catherine, inviting her to take over.  Catherine
	allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along
	the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Yeah, you like that, don't you?

	She can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at
	her from the shadows.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Is your name Carl?

	The boy - YOUNG STARGHER - is startled and intrigued by the
	question - How did she know that?! - but says nothing.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Another little boy I know, he has a
		horse, too.

	The boy reacts to an unusual SOUND coming from the CEILING.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		His name's Edward.  The boy, not the
		horse...

	The boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but
	he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than
	"connecting" with Catherine.  Very anxiously, he looks at the
	wall behind Catherine and watches an old wind-up kitchen
	TIMER click down.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What's the matter, Carl?

	Again, a sharp SOUND from the ceiling.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What's wro---?

	Young Stargher RUNS at her and SHOVES her hard!  Catherine
	FALLS BACK just as EIGHT SHEETS OF GLASS drop from the
	ceiling!  Like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse
	into four clean sections.  They separate and compact the
	quadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected
	horse stand within the room.  Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare
	barely acknowledged what happened.  Betraying no emotion, the
	boy runs.  The shaken Catherine takes a moment to collect
	herself, then gives chase.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE LABYRINTH

	Young Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but
	Catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight.  She
	runs, climbs and crawls.  Until she's utterly lost and
	disoriented.  Tired and having difficulty breathing, she
	drops to her knees and "cools down."  She hears a NOISE
	nearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM
	connected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an
	almost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she
	examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs
	of "traps" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls
	the mechanism and quickly steps back.

	The shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive
	in the tiny cubicle beyond.  She retreats into shadow,
	hiding.  Released from the chamber is a WOMAN.  As she moves
	out of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE.

	Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to
	"sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the
	shadows, and ATTACKS!

	Catherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT
	THE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! 
	She brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and
	SMACKS her head against it.  Catherine drops to the floor
	like a rag doll.

	Victim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great
	purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the
	core.  Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness
	and light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a "tour" of
	Stargher's world.  Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled
	with IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing
	intensity.  At one of the rooms, we think we see Young
	Stargher silently observing...

	Sitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S
	OTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the
	grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in
	Stargher's basement.  Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine
	Inch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored
	housewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the
	"harem."
	
	
	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE CORE

	VICTIM ONE drops Catherine in the center of the room and, job
	done, crawls away.

	Groggy, feeling sick, Catherine sits up.  Unbeknownst to her,
	she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the
	kind of THRONE.  And someone is there.  In the dim pool of
	light above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. 
	The wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he
	descends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL
	RINGS pierced through the flesh of his back.  In a fluid
	motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as
	the man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. 
	Unable to stop herself, she turns.  And sees the terrifying
	face of STARGHER.  But no the same Stargher.

	This is STARGHER KING.

				STARGHER KING
			(primitive, guttural)
		Where you come from priddy thing?

	In a split second, Catherine presses the implant on her hand.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	Apparently capable of staying awake if properly caffeinated,
	Novak sits cross-legged on the floor, shoes off, analyzing
	RECENT PHOTOS AND DOCUMENTS sent to him via courier. 
	Ignoring a snoring Ramsey napping on a nearby cot, Novak
	looks at blow-ups from the videos, blueprints of Stargher's
	house, detailed shots of the basement, and a draftsman's
	conceptual drawing of the cell itself.

				HENRY (V.O.)
		Gentlemen?

	Novak looks at an INTERCOM SPEAKER.

				HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		She's back.

	Novak doesn't wait for his just-stirring partner and moves.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	As he enters, Novak sees a concerned Henry checking a print
	out of the procedure.

				NOVAK
		What happened?

				HENRY
		Must've been rather unusual.

	Noting Novak's confusion, Henry points to a CENTRAL MONITOR
	resembling a futuristic V.U. meter, gradiated in sections of
	white, yellow, orange, and red.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
			(re: white/yellow area)
		If her neural activity stays within this
		range, I know she's self-cognitive.
			(clarifies)
		As if she were having a dream, but she
		knows she's dreaming.  She can "wake up"
		any time she wants to...

	As Ramsey joins them, Novak nods, understanding, but his eyes
	are on Catherine, who's just coming back to consciousness.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
			(re: orange section)
		However, if her level of involvement is
		rather intense, as it was just now, she
		can perceive things as true.  It's
		difficult to keep perspective.

	As Novak lingers on that question, Ramsey gestures at the red
	section.

				RAMSEY
		What happens here?

				HENRY
		We don't talk about that.

				NOVAK
		What happens?

				HENRY
		Well, Theoretically, while she's inside. 
		If she came to believe that Stargher's
		world is her world, her mind has the
		power to convince the body that anything
		done to it is, um, actually done.

	Novak doesn't like the sound of that.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		That's why we monitor the use of the
		drugs so closely.  We don't want her
		getting to that degree of perceptual
		disorientation.

				MIRIAM
		Pump in two liters of pure oxygen,
		please Henry.

	Henry types a command and Novak speaks into the intercom.

				NOVAK
		Dr. Kent?

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam eases Catherine back to
	consciousness.

				MIRIAM
		Deep breaths.

	When she sees Stargher, Catherine's flesh crawls.

				CATHERINE
		Is it cold in here?

				MIRIAM
		What happened?

	No response.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

	Incapable of being in the same room as him, Catherine tears
	out of the apparatus and anxiously exits.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Catherine!

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM:

				NOVAK
		I'll get her...

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY

	A worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center. 
	He's about to ask the staff for help, but stops when he sees
	through the window to Edward's room.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM

	Catherine sits next to the boy's bed, holding Edward's hand,
	softly singing a lullaby (to him, to herself).  Feeling that
	he must speak to her, Novak intervenes.

				NOVAK
		Edward Baines, I presume.
			(to the catatonic child)
		Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.

				CATHERINE
		Do you think that's funny?

				NOVAK
		No.  Not at all.  From what I
		understand, he knows I"m here, isn't
		that right?

	Catherine nods.  Novak picks up Edward's fallen teddy bear
	and rests it in the crook of the child's arm.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		I read about a woman in TExas who was in
		a coma for seven years.  Every time her
		husband came to visit, her heart would
		beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I
		don't know what name scientists have for
		something like that...

				CATHERINE
		It doesn't have much to do with science.

				NOVAK
		What then?

				CATHERINE
		The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you
		want to call it.

				NOVAK
		Ah, the part of us that can't be
		explained.

	She appreciates his understanding.  And finds herself
	comforted by his presence.  Catherine scrutinizes Novak, his
	intensity, his honesty, his complexity.  And asks:

				CATHERINE
		Agent Novak?

				NOVAK
		Peter, okay?

				CATHERINE
		Do you feel there's a side of yourself
		you don't show people?

	The question catches Novak off-guard, but he's willing to
	answer.  Anything to get her talking.

				NOVAK
		Absolutely.
			(realizing it's too personal)
		I suppose everyone does.

				CATHERINE
		Just like we all have fantasies, right? 
		Things only we know, that we don't
		share.

				NOVAK
		That's what therapists are for, right?

	Catherine laughs.  It helps her relax.  If only slightly.

				CATHERINE
		During the sessions.  When I'm inside. 
		I see those things.  What a person
		hides, what they despite, what they want
		to control.  With Stargher...

	This is difficult for her.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		With Stargher I saw things...

				NOVAK
		What did you see?

				CATHERINE
			(professionally)
		A kingdom.  His utopia. 
		Life without consequence or restriction. 
		He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. 
		He's this... idealized version of
		himself who can do anything he
		pleases... Without fear.  A horrible
		primitive ugly thing.
			(uncomfortable; re: Edward)
		I don't want to talk in here.

	She kisses Edward's forehead and exits.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY

	Catherine and Novak sit on a bench in the center of the
	courtyard.  John Tracy is visible in the reception area,
	unable to sleep, desperately trying to fight frustration.

				CATHERINE
		Why'd you bring him here?

				NOVAK
		You're the shrink, you tell me.

				CATHERINE
			(already knows)
		As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say
		yes.  He makes Julia real for me.

	Novak nods.  Guilty.

				NOVAK
		It's an old lawyer trick.  Target the
		emotions.  Do it right, you get a
		reluctant witness to testify, a scared
		kid to confess.

	Catherine looks at him with disbelief.  "You?!"

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Before I was with the Bureau, I was an
		attorney, a prosecutor.  Mr. Law and
		Order.  And then... I had a murder case
		in North Carolina.  Charles Gish. 
		Butchered seventeen people in three
		days.  And because of one tiny piece of
		tainted evidence, he walked.
			(no regrets)
		That's when I quit the DA's office and
		joined the FBI.

	Catherine can see the pain and frustration in Novak's eyes. 
	She gives him a moment and asks:

				CATHERINE
		You thought Stargher wanted to be
		caught.

				NOVAK
		I did, yeah.

				CATHERINE
		You were right.  There's a part of him
		that knows the truth.  About what he
		did, about himself.

	Novak's curiosity is piqued.

				NOVAK
		What about Julia?

				CATHERINE
		This is going to sound terrible, but...
		I don't think she matters anymore.  Not
		to him.  He never finished her.  The
		others...he was able to make them his.

				NOVAK
		You think you can do this, don't you?

				CATHERINE
		He might tell me about Julia.  The part
		of him that wants to help, that feels
		shame and remorse.  Who wants to be
		redeemed.

				NOVAK
			(skeptically)
		This is Stargher we're talking about?

				CATHERINE
		Not Stargher, not really.  He's split
		himself right down the middle. 
		Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. 
		A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I
		could reach the boy.

				NOVAK
		Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same
		guy?

				CATHERINE
		Don't you feel there are different sides
		to every personality?  Maybe even the
		worst of us is capable of one decent
		act.  We're all human.

				NOVAK
		It's hard for me to see Stargher as
		human, capable of something like
		"remorse."

				CATHERINE
		Then what is he?

				NOVAK
		Evil.

				CATHERINE
		If you believe that.

				NOVAK
		Maybe this is a big fucking waste of
		time.

				CATHERINE
			(sensing something)
		What happened to Charles Gish?

	Novak doesn't respond.  She prods him.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What happened?

				NOVAK
		What difference does it make...?

				CATHERINE
		Tell me.

	God, he does not want to do this.

				NOVAK
		Right after the trial, the night after
		he was released.  Mr. and Mrs. Frank
		Simmons found Charlie sitting in their
		living room watching TV with their
		twelve-year old daughter Margaret.  He'd
		cut her right down the middle with a
		carving knife.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Found the girl's heart in the freezer -
		he thought they might want to keep it.
			(grim humor)
		Luckily, the next thing he did was slit
		his own throat.
			(bleakly)
		I am convinced of one thing. 
		Charles Gish could've been raised by
		Ozzie and Harriet and the same thing
		would've happened.

	He can see Catherine doesn't accept that.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		A child can experience abuse worse than
		Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone
		who would never, ever hurt another
		living thing.

				CATHERINE
		You're sure of that?

				NOVAK
		Yes.  I am.

	Catherine realizes that was a confession.

				RAMSEY (O.S.)
		Where the hell you been?

	They turn to see Ramsey.

				NOVAK
		Right here.

				RAMSEY
		Next time, tell me, okay?

				NOVAK
		But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...

	Ramsey shoots him a murderous look, then asks Catherine.

				RAMSEY
		Your colleagues want to know what to do
		with Stargher.

	Novak looks to Catherine for the answer.  Through the window
	blinds, she watches John Tracy lower his head.

				CATHERINE
		Tell them to prep him.  And that I'll be
		right there.

	Ramsey nods and heads back to the lab.

				NOVAK
		Thank you.

	Briefly, he touches her hand.  Catherine looks away from John
	to Novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall.  Stargher's
	house, Valentine, the pick-up truck.  Valentine...

				CATHERINE
		I need something.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CORRIDOR - DAY

	A K-9 UNIT FBI AGENT escorts VALENTINE to the lab.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring
	area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection." 
	Slowly, confidently, she approaches the Shepherd, kneels, and
	removes his leash and muzzle.  She strokes him and the dog
	instantly warms up to her.

				FBI K-9 AGENT
		Sure wasn't like that with me.

	Novak signs a document and the K-9 Agent exits.

				CATHERINE
		You're a good boy, aren't you,
		Valentine?

	The dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves
	it, Catherine and Novak following.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Stargher lies face down on a gurney. 
	Now taped to the wall near Stargher are PICTURES from the
	basement - his dolls, the hoist, etc.  Miriam (in surgical
	mask and gloves) carefully re-inserts the METAL RINGS (taken
	from an FBI EVIDENCE BAG) into the eight straps of flesh on
	his back.  When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides. 
	Catherine comforts him.  Miriam finishes her task and removes
	her mask.

				MIRIAM
		I hate to admit it, but there's
		something perversely satisfying about
		this.

				HENRY
		I think that's the whole point.

	Valentine runs to his "sleeping" master and barks at
	Catherine as if asking for help.  She encourages the animal
	to lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands.

				HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		That's interesting.

	IN THE CONTROL ROOM, he scrutinizes the monitor showing the
	detailed "map" of Stargher's brain.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		Increased neural activity in the frontal
		lobes.  Rising dopamine levels in the
		basal ganglia.  Ever since the dog
		walked in.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine readies herself in the
	"receive" apparatus.  As Stargher is lifted off the pedestal,
	the doors HISS shut and Valentine curls up on the floor
	beneath his master.  As Catherine is lifted, she smiles at
	the animal, then looks to Stargher.

				NOVAK
			(comforting and coaching her)
		Remember, Julia Hickson is priority
		number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find
		out where she is.

				CATHERINE
		Okay, okay...

	LIGHTS FLICKER.  Catherine's eyes shut.  FADE TO BLACK...

				HENRY (O.S.)
		Uh-oh...

	LIGHTS FLICKER.  We hear an ELECTRICAL HUM rise and fall. 
	Catherine opens her eyes and the LIGHTS blink on and off in a
	weird pattern, making it difficult to see clearly.

				CATHERINE
		Don't kid around, Henry...

	Her suspension apparatus DESCENDS on the floor.

				HENRY (O.S.)
		I'm not.  It's a power problem.  I need
		you to go to the circuit breaker and
		check switches six through twelve.

	Catherine moves toward the electrical panel.

				HENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Try to stay awake, okay?

				CATHERINE
		Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not sleepy.

	As she moves toward the panel, everything becomes larger.  By
	the time Catherine reaches the circuit breaker, it is the
	size of a garage door.  Curiouser and curiouser...

	She turns around to see the LABORATORY IS EMPTY and DEAD
	QUIET.  And she sees herself - Catherine as small as a mouse
	trapped in a giant walled space.

	AT THE CONSOLE, Novak, Miriam and Henry observe the procedure
	room.  And Catherine.  Suspended in the apparatus. 
	Motionless...

	ENTRANCE TWO

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

	Catherine turns to see... Catherine lying in the fetal
	position, locked in a BOX made of thick clean glass.  The
	electronic HUM becomes RHYTHMIC, AMBIENT NOISE.. INSIDE THE
	BOX, staying calm, she searches for and finds a TRAP DOOR on
	the floor.  She pushes out.  The camera executes a complete
	180-degree perspective change.

	Catherine plummets.  She tries to reach out, to stop her
	descent, but cannot.

	Catherine falls through a dark CAVERNOUS ROOM resembling a
	mammoth hollowed-out rib cage.  Below her is a DOME-LIKE
	STRUCTURE "growing" out of the floor, a HOLE in the center of
	its crest.  Dozens of other such domes are visible in the
	murky hell-hole, but Catherine has no choice.  She's dropping
	into this one.

	Once she passes through the hole, INSIDE THE DOME,
	Catherine's body looks as though it's moving through water,
	but there is no water.  Like an aerial artist, she reverses
	her position so she's "heads up."  Standing, stable, on the
	floor.  Sensing something with her.  And knows it is...

				CATHERINE
		Valentine?

	Out from the darkness, moving in normal motion, comes the
	white German Shepherd, but in the thick haze, his face is
	indistinct and ghostly.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Hi sweetie...

	And as she steps toward him, his face DISSOLVES into a STARK
	LANDSCAPE.  An ear becomes a hill, the nose a stone, mouth a
	path, and the eye a HOUSE. 
	YOUNG STARGHER retreats towards the bleak structure as
	CATHERINE ENTERS FRAME.  Seeing the invitation, she presses
	on.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BOYHOOD HOME - KITCHEN

	Young Stargher is at the sink WASHING DISHES, an anxious eye
	on the clock.

				CATHERINE
		Need some help?

	As Catherine enters the claustrophobic house, the boy
	hesitantly pushes a towel toward her, but doesn't look.  She
	reaches the counter and starts to dry, much to Young
	Stargher's relief.  As he washes, Catherine hands him a
	MIRROR LOCKET just like Edward's.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Carl, I want to give you a present.

	He's hypnotized by the thing, his eyes lighting up.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		If you need me, or if you feel that I'm
		around but can't find me, just shine it,
		like this.

	She shines reflected light onto the walls.  Carl hands
	Catherine the wet plate and takes the locket.  The dish slips
	from her fingers and SHATTERS on the floor.  The boy's eyes
	fill with dread.  The kitchen clock reads 5:30.  He PUSHES
	Catherine toward a broom closet and shoves her inside.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		What's wrong honey?

	With a finger to his lips, he pockets the locket and shuts
	the door.  FROM WITHIN THE CLOSET, she watches the terrified
	child through a CRACK in the door.  IN THE KITCHEN, Young
	Stargher desperately tries to hide the broken plate. 
	Startlingly, his father, Martin Stargher, is already in the
	room.  Cruel, imposing, manipulative man.

				MARTIN
		What did you do know?  You make a mess? 
		I hate a mess.

	Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		Don't lie, now, Carl.

	IN THE CLOSET, Catherine pushes, but the door won't budge. 
	She POUNDS.  IN THE KITCHEN, we hear no sound.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		Remember what I said about liars?  Liars
		will be punished.

	INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

	Catherine hears the child SCREAM.  But the scream comes from
	behind and she spins around.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIVING ROOM

	Young Stargher is forced to sit on the lap of an ugly MIDDLE
	AGED WOMAN barely wearing a man's robe.  On a nearby table
	are whisky, tumblers, and an ashtray filled with butts.

				WOMAN
		I got you a present, cutie-pie.

	She gives him a TOY DOLL.  Drunk, she hugs and kisses him. 
	Embarrassed, the boy tries to squirm away.

				WOMAN (CONT'D)
		Oh no.  You're not going anywhere.

	Martin enters and sneers at the boy.

				MARTIN
		Go back to bed, worm.

				WOMAN
		It's okay, we was just.

				MARTIN
		Shut up, cunt.

	The woman cowers, familiar with his violent moods.  The boy
	hurries to his room, but Martin grabs him by the collar.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		What is that?

	He pulls the doll from the child's hands, turns to the woman,
	and SMACKS her across the face with it, gashing her cheek.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		You give him nothing.  Whore.  Are you
		his mother?  ARE YOU?

	Terrified, she shakes her head "no."  Martin sees Young
	Stargher quietly crawling away, hoping to escape. 
	Martin lifts the boy off the floor with one hand and holds
	him in front of the woman.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		You see that?  SEE IT?  You slithered
		out one of them.  But where is she now,
		Carl?  As far from you as she could get,
		that's where.
			(shoves him at the woman)
		You want a mommy?  Is that what you
		want?

	The poor boy trembles with fear.  And Martin notices a puddle
	of urine on the floor.  He drops the boy and laughs.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		Little worm pissed his pants.

	Humiliated, Carl covers himself and hides in a corner. 
	Martin and the woman LAUGH AND LAUGH, delighting in the boy's
	humiliation.

	INT. CLOSET

	Feeling the boy's shame, Catherine turns and finds a FADED
	POSTCARD taped to the wall.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BEDROOM

	Martin has discovered his son's secret hiding place - a
	camouflaged corner of the attic.  Arranged in deliberate,
	artistic fashion are scavenged DOLLS.  Heads, limbs and
	torsos held together with twine, tape and wire.  Some wrapped
	in filthy plastic.  Faded photographs (including one of his
	MOTHER), mementos, and most disturbingly, the feathers and
	bones of dead birds, insect carcasses, and dissected,
	desiccated mice.  There's something peculiarly beautiful
	here, but Martin doesn't see it.  Not at all.

				MARTIN
		Only girls play with dolls...

	He turns and we see Carl is bound to a wooden support beam, a
	piece of tape covering his mouth.  The boy is stripped to the
	waste, barely conscious, face streaked with tears and sweat.

				MARTIN (CONT'D)
		What kind of thing are you?

	INT. CLOSET

	A WEIRD NOISE snaps Catherine back to "reality."  She turns
	just as a door opens behind her.  Responding to the
	"invitation," she moves through it.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM

	The adult Carl Stargher sits at the edge of the tub, his back
	to us, smoking a cigarette.  A white German Shepherd PUPPY
	clicks across the tile floor and YIPS at Catherine.  She
	again hears the WEIRD NOISE.  A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL wobbles
	as Stargher's bloody rubber-gloved hands fill it with
	something.  Stargher knows she's there and isn't surprised by
	her presence, but he's not sure what to make of her.  What to
	do with her.  He rises and walks past her to the sink.  He
	pulls off the gloves and washes his hands, glancing at her in
	the mirror.

	Catherine cannot resist looking in the tub.  She sees a dead
	girl, her torso sliced open.  Disgusted and mortified, she
	pulls back.

				STARGHER (O.S.)
		She was the first...

	She turns, and Stargher is no longer at the sink.

				STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Didn't know what I was doing...

	She turns, where's this voice coming from?!  She steps back.

				STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Be careful...

	The bumps into the stainless steel bowl and it topples to the
	floor, spilling its contents of human organs.  Wobble-wobble
	wobble.  The bowl makes its now-familiar noise.

				STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		What did you do now?  You make a mess?

	And she can see him coming out of the shadows.  Catherine
	backs into a corner, fearing what will come.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		I hate a mess.

	Stargher steps into a pool of light, shooshes the puppy into
	the hall, shuts the bathroom door, and looks right at
	Catherine.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Why are you here?

	God almighty, what does she say?  What does she tell him?!

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Don't lie, now...

	SCRITCH-SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  The puppy scratches at the door and
	whimpers, but Stargher's not about to let him back in. 
	Moving slowly, carefully, he approaches Catherine.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Liars will be punished.  

	Catherine makes a break for the door.  "Playfully," Stargher
	makes a half-hearted attempt to block her, but she evades him
	and reaches for the knob.  But the door's not there.  SCRITCH
	SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  She can still hear the dog, but there's no
	damn door.  She turns:

	No door.  No window.  The girl's body and bloody remains have
	vanished.  An OVERHEAD LIGHT flickers on, giving the room the
	look and feel of the cell.

				STARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Where do you think you're going?

	Catherine turns, back to the wall, calm and intimidating,
	Stargher stands in the center regarding her with great
	curiosity.  Catherine's ready to press the sensor.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Don't do that.

	She hesitates.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		If you go away, you'll never find her.

	How did he know?

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		If you never find her, she dies.  Like
		the rest.

	Catherine stops and listens.  She can't leave now.  The path
	to Julia has appeared.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		I mean, that's why you're here, right? 
		Why you came to my happy little home?

	He reaches for her and she flinches.  Expecting such
	behavior, Stargher grins.

				STARGHER (CONT'D)
		You're pretty.  A pretty, pretty thing.

	Catherine cannot show her fear, not now.  She composes
	herself and approaches him.

				CATHERINE
		I want to help you, Carl.

	His grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs.

				STARGHER
		Help me?  That's good.  That's a good
		one.
			(malevolent)
		Liar.  Whore.  Cunt.

	Catherine stands her ground.

				CATHERINE
		You sound like your father.

	He gets close to her face and sneers.

				STARGHER
		I am not like him.

	Stargher retreats into the shadows, but Catherine persists.

				CATHERINE
		Then help me.  Where is Julia Hickson?

				STARGHER
		Why?

				CATHERINE
		Maybe, because you want to.

				STARGHER
		Is that right?  You think you know me?
			
			
			INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

	Henry sees a rapid rise in Catherine's warning meter.

				HENRY
		Miriam...

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM

	A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.

				STARGHER (O.S.)
		You wanna know who I am?  You stupid
		bitch!

	And when he emerges from shadow, Stargher is STARGHER KING.

				STARGHER KING
		Now shud you mouth, priddy thing, or me
		god slice you from the kunt to the tits.

	Catherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand.  He GRABS,
	LIFTS and SLAMS her onto the floor, the back of her head
	HITTING HARD.  Her vision blurs.  Ears are ringing.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		Me god want you stay.

	Stargher King straddles Catherine and pins her arms behind
	her back.  She's unable to touch the sensor.  With the tip of
	the TOOL he traces a line from her pelvis up the center of
	her suit.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		Me god mek you beaudiful...

	He shoves the tool through her neck and presses the trigger.  
	A COLLAR CLAMPS SHUT around Catherine's neck and...

	She blacks out.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	A SENSOR ALARM SOUNDS on the computer.  Henry and Miriam
	express shock at the sight of the monitor peaking in the red
	and move to the "map" of Catherine's mind.  As it becomes
	"cool," Stargher's becomes "hot."

				MIRIAM
		Son of a bitch!

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, VALENTINE BARKS!  Startling everyone. 
	The dog GROWLS and backs away.  As if he senses something
	horribly wrong within his master.

	IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Novak questions the scientists.

				NOVAK
		When we got here, you just topped and
		pulled her out.

				MIRIAM
		That was with Edward.  She's accustomed
		to his world.  Stargher's mind is
		unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."
			(looks at the third suit)
		Someone has to go in. 
		Remind her what's really happening.  And
		get her out.  Until then, she's at his
		mercy.

	Mercy.  Novak's mind reels.

				NOVAK
		Into Stargher.  Inside...

				MIRIAM
		Yes.

	Novak knows who that person will be.

	INT. CELL - DAY

	Fueling herself with candy and juice, Julia examines the cell
	for a way out, but finds tight seals everywhere.  THE SHOWER
	ERUPTS WITH WATER!   She counts until thirty, it stops. 
	Shivering, Julia stars at the drain as the water spirals
	down.

				JULIA
			(trying to remember the words)
		Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed
		be thy name.  Thy kingdom come, thy will
		be done.

	ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS, we watch her through one-way
	glass from the video camera's point-of-view.  She looks right
	at "us," in the mirror, saddened by the dark circles under
	her bloodshot eyes.

				JULIA (CONT'D)
		...on Earth as it is in Heaven.

	We drift to the right and see the l.e.d. counters CLICKING
	AWAY.  01:44:54, 01:44:53, 01:44:52... Less than TWO HOURS to
	live and she has no idea.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak lies in a hastily-rigged THIRD
	APPARATUS/SUSPENSION DEVICE.  Miriam connects him to the IV
	cylinder and tubes.

				MIRIAM
		I have done this, you know.  Been
		inside.

				NOVAK
		No.

	Miriam nods, knowing he won't accept an opposing argument.

				MIRIAM
			(instructs him)
		Deep breaths.

	IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Henry adjusts monitors showing
	Novak's vital signs.

				HENRY
		Pulse is rapid, pressure's a little
		high...

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam asks:

				MIRIAM
		Nervous?

				NOVAK
		Absolutely.

	She loads a MICROCHIP SENSOR into a high-pressure injection
	gun and IMPLANTS it in NOVAK's HAND.  He winces from the
	brief pain as she loads the chemical cartridges.

				MIRIAM
		I have to ask you some things... Are you
		taking any prescription drugs?

				NOVAK
		Prevacid.  For my stomach.

				MIRIAM
		Any psychiatric medication?

				NOVAK
		No.  

				MIRIAM
		What about narcotics?

				NOVAK
		No.

				MIRIAM
		I know your partner's here, but it's
		very important that you're honest.

				NOVAK
		I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.

				MIRIAM
		I doubt that.

	Henry checks the "maps,"  Catherine's vitals and reports.

				HENRY
		We should hurry.

	Miriam walks Novak through what's about to happen.

				MIRIAM
		The first five minutes will be
		disorienting.  Give yourself time.  Let
		the drugs do the work.  If you can see,
		smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're
		on the right track.  Once you've
		acclimated, try to get a feeling for
		Catherine.  Instinct plays a huge role
		in this.  Trust it.

	She gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder, exits and
	shuts the door.  IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Miriam continues
	via intercom.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		You can control how you see yourself -
		clothes, shoes, that kind of thing - but
		the rest of it is up to him.  Use only
		what he provides.  Don't try to change
		anything.  Or introduce something of
		your own.  It'll only upset him.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak flexes his fingers and sees the
	little bump beneath his flesh.

				HENRY (O.S.)
		Agent Novak?  Press the sensor.

	Novak does and the red light comes on.  As Novak is LIFTED,
	he looks at Catherine, then Stargher.  Valentine YIPS and
	settles beneath Novak.  The suspension device clicks into
	place and the MASK descends.

				MIRIAM (O.S.)
		No matter what happens, Peter, remember
		one thing: It's not real.

	Novak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the IV-like
	cylinder.  A liquid cloud of his blood grows within. 
	Preparing the mixture for injection.

	The viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the CAMERA
	MOVES INTO THE MIXTURE.  As blood and chemical swirls take
	shape, we MOVE FAST.  Deeper into the fluid at a molecular
	level.  We feel like we're SOARING over some kind of liquid
	landscape.

	NOVAK HYPERVENTILATES.  He's having difficulty making the 98
	transition.

	Flying faster, faster, faster.  Through an entire universe.

	Novak is in the procedure room.  Alone.  His face contorted
	as if feeling the effects of tremendous G-FORCE.

	ENTRANCE THREE

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD

	CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with
	hills.  THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their
	bodies positioned in a uniform pattern.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL
	NOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down
	in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. 
	With difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak
	breathes deeply and rises to his knees.  His hand moves to
	his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the
	gravel, the sharpness of it against his face.  Removing the
	shroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes
	it.

				MOTHER ONE (O.S.)
		Have you seen him?

	Novak finds the first of the three - VISIONS OF STARGHER'S
	MOTHER - addressing him.  She, like the other two, speaks in
	a ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion.

				MOTHER ONE (CONT'D)
		My boy, my little one.  His father took
		him from me.  Have you seen him?

	As she continues, almost mantra-like, WOMAN TWO BEGINS:

				MOTHER TWO
			(similar monotone)
		My child is an abomination.  He is
		damned.  He has no soul.

	The women's repetitive "monologues" overlap.  Aurual layers
	now added by THREE.

				MOTHER THREE
		Me god me boy.  Me god good son.

	Novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings.  The sights,
	sounds and feel of the place.  Like being within a dream.  As
	he backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances
	across his face.  Shading his eyes.  Novak searches for the
	source.

	Opposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL.  A
	massive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows."  Like a
	star, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of
	MIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH
	cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall.

	The light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to
	CLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly
	infinite passages.  Like tombs, or the "drawers" of a
	mausoleum.  Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. 
	Fades.  And Novak crawls into darkness.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN

	Novak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence. 
	The place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty.  As he moves
	deeper into the chamber, Novak sees YOUNG STARGHER perched
	atop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror
	LOCKET, bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of
	the room

	The FLICKERING LIGHT pinpoints a FIGURE emerging from the
	darkness.  It is Catherine.  Altered to an image of
	Stargher's victims.  Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just
	like the Victims'.  It's a shocking, strange image, made even
	more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face.  Novak
	is staggered by the sight.  His vision and hearing become
	affected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to
	clarity as he reminds himself...

				NOVAK
		Not real...

	Like an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him,
	narrowing her eyes.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Catherine.

	She exhibits no recognition of her name.  Catherine
	seductively moves closer to Novak, their bodies almost
	touching, her hands caressing his hair, lips, neck...

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Jesus.  Catherine.  Listen to me...

	She presses her finger to his lips and forces him down, onto
	the floor, his back to the pedestal.  Catherine straddles
	Novak, and when he tries to stand, she holds him down,
	forcing him to stay.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		LISTEN TO ME!

	She steals a glance over his shoulder and glimpses a MALE
	FIGURE coming toward them, coming into the light.  Novak is
	utterly unaware of what's happening.  Catherine is keeping
	him occupied.  Waiting for the arrival of...

	STARGHER KING

	Catherine LAUGHS.  Novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of
	the monster before Stargher King GRABS him by the throat and
	SMASHES his head against a pedestal.

	BLACKOUT.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN

	Eyelids rise and flutter.  Novak becomes conscious.  And
	instantly realizes what's happened.

	He lies on the pedestal, face up, spread-eagle, his wrists
	and ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery
	cords.  Standing over him, in a pool of light, is Stargher
	King.  Wearing what could be seen as CEREMONIAL GARB, a
	silent, solemn Stargher King prepares himself for execution
	of a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of
	shiny, sharp, macabre TOOLS.

	Novak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself, Not real. 
	He opens them, breathes deeply and focuses on Catherine.

				NOVAK
		You're Catherine Young.  You majored in
		Psych at UC San Diego.  You work for
		Sunerset Industries.

	Stargher King's fingers pass over an array of horrific
	instruments - the throat piercer/collar mechanism, a cleaver
	knife, a misshapen hammer, a long slender needle...

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Your grandmother raised you after your
		parents died in a car crash...

	Stargher King lifts the blade-like NEEDLE.  So far, Catherine
	looks at Novak like he's speaking gibberish.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		When you were twenty-one, you were
		arrested for possession and got off with
		community service.

	Stargher King SLICES through Novak's clothes, exposing the
	flesh of his abdomen.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
			(reminding himself)
		Not real, Pete...This is not real...
			(urgency)
		You had to work at a center for abused
		kids for three months.  You stayed on
		two years for no pay.  You give half
		your fucking salary to the nursing home
		your grandmother stays at...

	Stargher King grabs his throat and traces the blade down the
	center of Novak's torso.  Novak struggles and pleads with
	Catherine.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		I know this because I work for the FBI. 
		Peter Novak, remember?!?!
			(a desperate request)
		Remember.  You are Cath-

	Stargher King cuts his flesh and INSERTS the needle into his
	stomach.  NOVAK SCREAMS!  This fucking hurts!

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		Help me!!!

	Stargher King wiggles the needle, pulls it out, and digs his
	finger into the wound.  NOVAK CRIES IN PAIN.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
			(tears forming, horrified)
		Fucking FEELS real!

	The intensity of Novak's cries hit Catherine like a
	thunderbolt.  There's a glimmer of life, of recognition in
	her eyes.

				STARGHER KING
			(finally speaking)
		Me god gut you like a dear.

	Although we don't see it, we HEAR something awful.  Like
	Stargher King fishing around inside the wound.  A pale,
	sweating Novak tries to stay conscious.  He will not go into
	shock...

				NOVAK
		Not real.  Not real.  Not real.

	A FEMALE HAND grabs the tool from the tray.

				STARGHER KING
			(mimicking Novak, laughing)
		Nod reel, nod reel, nod reel...

	STARGHER KING IS SLAMMED FROM BEHIND!  CATHERINE RAMS THE
	THING THROUGH HIS THROAT!   As Stargher King stumbles away
	gagging, blood pouring form his neck, we see that she has
	returned to normal.  The "bride" persona is gone.  As
	Stargher King emits animalistic growls, Catherine turns and
	sees an intact Novak standing next to her.  As if nothing had
	happened.

	Catherine and Novak RUN out of the den, into the tunnel from
	which Novak gained access.  He stops, ready to press the
	sensor, when a FLICKER OF LIGHT dances across Catherine's
	face.

				CATHERINE
		Wait...

				NOVAK
		Like hell "wait."

	But she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she
	moves further from the den toward the cliff face.  The
	FLICKER OF LIGHT shines on the entrance to a specific TUNNEL.

				CATHERINE
		He wants us to follow.  The little
		boy...

				NOVAK
		Little boy?!  That's him!

				CATHERINE
		He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you
		want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust
		him.

	INT. TUNNEL/CUBBYHOLE

	On her hands and knees, she enters the TUNNEL, not waiting
	for him to respond.  She knows what he'll do... Catherine and
	Novak crawl through the dark, grimy claustrophobic space,
	playing with his mirror locket.

				CATHERINE
		Carl...

	He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him
	from reaching out to her.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		This is Peter.

	Scared, he shakes his head "no."

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Don't be scared.  You're my friend and I
		would never hurt you.

	She extends her hand.  Oh-so-hesitantly he takes it.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Will you take us to her?  To Julia?

	Shyly, hesitantly, he nods.  She smiles gratefully and
	affectionately touches the boy's face.  Clasping her hand,
	Young Stargher leads Catherine and Novak into utter darkness.

	INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE IDEALIZED CELL

	More stylized than the actual cell, it's bigger and ornately
	decorated, with the atmosphere of a church.  Individual
	IMAGES hang like SHRINES, each showing Julia Hickson from
	different angles.

	Central to the room is a WINDOW INTO THE CELL ITSELF.  Where
	we find a beautiful, mermaid-like JULIA HICKSON floating in
	water.  Peaceful, joyous.

	IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, we find Novak and Catherine, she
	holding the hand of Young Stargher, he stunned at the sight
	of Julia.  The child looks at Catherine with beatific, sad
	eyes, regarding her as one would a saviour.

				NOVAK
		Where the hell are we?

				CATHERINE
		Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...

	He shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		It's okay, it's okay.  You helped so
		much already.  I'm proud of you.

	As a frustrated Novak searches for anything identifying,
	Catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad,
	haunted eyes.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Carl, I think I can help you.  Would you
		like that?  Even if Peter can't find
		Julia, I want to help you.

	The boy leans against her and she caresses his face.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I promise.

	Novak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell. 
	Mounted beneath the glass is a shiny, perfect metal plaque
	reading CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, with a logo.  Novak
	recognizes it from the hoist in Stargher's basement.

				NOVAK
		Let's go.

	He pulls her to her feet.  Feeling betrayed and rejected, the
	child breaks away from her.  THE ROAR OF STARGHER KING shakes
	the cell.  Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.

				CATHERINE
		CARL!

	Novak feels what's coming.

				NOVAK
		COME ON!

				CATHERINE
		I can't leave him!

	STARGHER KING APPEARS!  His throat wounded, bloody mess, he
	descends out of dark nothingness, HOWLING with rage.  He
	reaches for Catherine, but Young Stargher runs in front of
	her.  

	STARGHER KING CLAMPS HIS MASSIVE ARMS AROUND THE CHILD! 
	Little Carl opens his mouth in a silent scream... Catherine's
	arms reach out to him, but Novak clasps her hand and presses. 
	And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the
	arms of a monster...

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	Henry notices significant activity on the monitors.

				HENRY
		They're back.

	Everything happens fast.  He and Miriam frantically cease the
	procedure. 
	Novak and Catherine are lowered and Novak startles them by
	quickly regaining consciousness.  Miriam attempts to inject
	him with stabilizing drugs, but he's already trying to tear
	himself out of the apparatus.

				NOVAK
		Get me out!

	Miriam MOVES into the PROCEDURE ROOM.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		GET ME OUT!

	Miriam tries to follow protocol, but Novak is moving like a
	fish caught in a net, ripping and tearing his way out of the
	apparatus and suit.  He gets to his feet, but soon falls to
	his knees, dizzy and disoriented.

				MIRIAM
		Don't move!

	Novak is not listening.  Fighting off any after-effects- both
	physical and mental - he moves for the door.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Agent Novak!

	Catherine is coming back and Miriam moves to her.  Novak
	pauses just for a moment.

				NOVAK
		Is she alright?

				MIRIAM
		Yes.  But you're going to sit down right
		now.  I have to...

	Novak is already gone.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM

	Novak speed-dials a number on speaker-phone, hurriedly
	dresses, and locates a photograph of Stargher's basement. 
	When he hears someone pick up the line, he barks:

				NOVAK
		This is Novak, who've I got?

	A confused Ramsey enters and listens.

	INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT

	A team of FBI AGENTS is meticulously going through every inch
	of Stargher's house. 
	Crisscrossed wooden beams have been laid across the pit
	allowing forensics experts to search without disturbing
	anything.  On the other end of the direct line is COLE...

				COLE
		Agent Cole.

	(INTERCUT WITH NOVAK AND RAMSEY)

				NOVAK
		I need you to find something in the
		basement...

				COLE
		Already there.

				NOVAK
		That hoist, with the winch...

	WE FOLLOW Cole as he moves to the machine.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		There's some kind of plaque, a metal
		plate, with a logo.  On the base.

	Cole locates it.

				COLE
			(reading)
		Carver Industrial Equipment.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM

	Novak instructs him...

				NOVAK
		Find out the history of that machine. 
		Who bought it, used it, sold it.  And
		check Stargher's pay stubs.  I want to
		know every contractor he worked for. 
		I'm calling you from the chopper in ten
		minutes.

	Dizziness and disorientation again hit Novak.  Pale and
	sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.

				RAMSEY
		Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.

				NOVAK
		Considering where I've been...

	Fighting the pain, he gathers together MAPS, slips on his
	shoes and grabs gun and holster.  Ramsey is apoplectic.

				RAMSEY
		Whoa-whoa-whoa.  Mind telling me what
		the fuck is happening?

	 Novak points to the photo of Stargher's basement,
	specifically the hoist.

				RAMSEY (CONT'D)
		You're bettin' the farm on something you
		saw after they pumped you full of god
		knows-what kind of shit?

				NOVAK
		I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw
		everything.

				RAMSEY
		You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing
		with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.

	Novak is not stopping...

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam shines the penlight into
	Catherine's eyes.

				CATHERINE
		...a pocketful of rye.

				MIRIAM
		Four and twenty blackbirds...

				CATHERINE
		Baked in a pie.

	AT THE CONSOLE, on a security monitor, Henry can see Novak
	and Ramsey exiting down the corridor.

				HENRY
		The FBI has left the building.

	IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam appears concerned.

				MIRIAM
		Damn him.

				CATHERINE
		What's wrong?

				MIRIAM
		Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to
		clear him.

	Catherine encourages her.

				CATHERINE
		Go.  I'm fine.  Go.

	As Miriam hurries to catch Novak, she tells Henry.

				MIRIAM
		Keep an eye on her.

	He nods, but isn't really paying attention.  Catherine turns
	to Stargher's motionless form, still suspended, still
	connected to the machinery.

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

				JULIA
		Do something, Julia.

	She looks around the room and runs her hands along the walls,
	the tile, looking for a weak spot.  She focuses on the
	CEILING PANEL and although it's painful because of swollen
	fingers, removes her ENGAGEMENT RING.

	EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER

	A ready-and-waiting HELICOPTER is on the pad.  Novak races
	out of the Center, Ramsey right behind him, SHOUTING at each
	other in order to hear above the chopper noise.

				RAMSEY
		Pete, listen to me.  What did you really
		learn in there?  Anything new?  You
		really think Stargher gave you a save
		the-day clue?  What if this is all some
		kind of trick your head is playing on
		you?

	He won't consider that.  Novak climbs into the helicopter and
	buckles himself in.  He looks to Ramsey - you coming? -
	Ramsey pats the side of the chopper and signals for the pilot
	to take off.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	Henry analyzes voluminous print-outs from the last procedure. 
	Although his eyes are on the data, he converses with
	Catherine in the PROCEDURE ROOM via intercom.

				HENRY
		...there was a moment when we thought
		we'd lost Agent Novak as well.

	We see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the
	procedure, but Henry is oblivious.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		His post-procedure consciousness
		recovery was remarkably quick.  Never
		saw that before.  Hey, remember that one
		time...

	He JUMPS when the door to the procedure room SEALS SHUT and
	mechanisms HUM.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		Catherine?

	When he looks through the window, Catherine is again
	suspended, the procedure under way.

				HENRY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing?

	He types in a command, but nothing happens.  He tires again.
	On another keyboard, but gets no response.  When he looks at
	the "map" screens, he sees something odd.  It's a small
	change, but it makes all the difference in the world.
	
			INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Like a rock climber in a crevasse, Julia shimmies up the
	walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using
	her hands and feet to push up.  The tile is slippery and each
	movement precarious.

	She uses strength and balance to reach a position just below
	the Plexiglass, the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie
	intense glow.  She sees a gap between the glass and the wall
	and uses her ENGAGEMENT RING to dig into it, SCAPE, SCRAPE,
	SCRAPING with the diamond.

	THE SHOWER SPRAYS WATER!  Julia nearly loses her balance, but
	manages to stay pressed into the corner.  She kicks the
	shower head, sending the spray as far from her as possible,
	and continues to dig at the caulking around the light
	fixture.

	IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, we see something unexpected.  The
	clock reads 00:00:00.  That water isn't going to stop.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM

	Miriam and Ramsey return to the lab to find Henry anxiously
	observing from the console.

				HENRY
			(flustered)
		She changed the codes.

				MIRIAM
		What's wrong?

				HENRY
		It would take hours to re-route the
		system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.

				RAMSEY
		What are you talking about?

	Miriam analyzes the situation and regretfully, angrily,
	worriedly realizes what's happened.

				MIRIAM
		She's done it.  Stupid, stupid girl...

				RAMSEY
		Done what?

				HENRY
		Instead of going into his mind...

				MIRIAM
		She's bringing Stargher into hers.

	ENTRANCE FOUR

	INT. CATHERINE'S WORLD

	A bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of
	things we saw in Catherine's home.  Unusual trees, rock
	formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant POOL OF WATER.

	The pond ripples.  Visible through the crystal-clear water is
	YOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim
	suddenly breaking through to air.  Panicked, he scrambles to
	shore and pulls himself to land.  Although the place is
	comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it
	frightens him.  Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this
	way and that.

				CATHERINE (O.S.)
		You're all right, Carl.

	The boy turns toward the voice and finds CATHERINE, her hair
	waving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a
	magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior
	goddess. 
	She opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the
	comfort of her embrace.  He shivers and she holds him
	tightly.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		It's okay, honey, you're with me now. 
		You're safe here.

	She looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I promised I would help you, and I
		always keep my promises.

				YOUNG STARGHER
		Can...

	Catherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak.  A
	sad, trembling little voice.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Can I stay here?

	She is touched that he would ask and strokes his face.

				CATHERINE
			(regretfully)
		Oh...no, honey, I'm sorry.  It's doesn't
		work that way.

	The boy breaks away from her, turning his back.  She gently
	takes his hand but he yanks it free.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		But what if I told you you could come
		visit?

	He slowly turns to her.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I'll make sure it happens, Carl.  I'll
		get them to let me do it.  And maybe...
		maybe we can...

	Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.  Over his
	shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool. 
	CENTIPEDES CRAWL over her legs and hair.  She stands and
	brushes them off.  The atmosphere grows darker and ominous.

				YOUNG STARGHER
		He found me...

	Catherine bristles as STARGHER KING RISES FROM THE POOL like
	a human serpent.  The brilliant colors of Catherine's world
	fade to GRIM TONES.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		He always finds me.

	Stargher King SCREECHES with anger and confusion.

				STARGHER KING
		Where thiisss att?!?!  Me god no like id
		here...

	He snarls when he sees Catherine.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		You.  Priddy bish-hor-kund.  You big
		trubble-mekker...
			(sneers at the boy)
		And you.  You cumm home now, liddle
		cogsugger worm.  Or me god haffa punish
		you...

	Young Stargher tightens his embrace of Catherine.  She steps
	back, away from the pond, hugging the boy tightly.

				CATHERINE
		No.!

				STARGHER KING
		No?!??!?!?!?

	Stargher King laughs.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		Hoo you thing you are?? Himm Muther?

	He comes close and reaches for the boy...

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		You gimme liddle worm.

	For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated. 
	Perhaps near an emotional breakdown.  But that is not the
	case.  She quietly lowers little Carl to the ground and
	whispers something in his ear.  As the boy nods, runs and
	hides, a ferocity grows within her.

				CATHERINE
		I said no.

	Like a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a
	BATTLE CRY!  STARGHER ATTACKS!  Arms reaching for her. 
	Catherine BLOCKS, PUNCHES, AND KICKS.  Stargher King doubles
	over.  Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her
	bent KNEE, breaking his nose.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		Welcome to my world.

	As blood flows from his nostrils, Stargher King grins...

				STARGHER KING
		You funny.  You thing you stop me god?

	HE CHARGES.  At the right moment, Catherine sidesteps and
	SMASHES him in the ribs as he passes.  Stargher King crumples
	to the ground and she KICKS an uppercut to this chin.  Rising
	from the mud and muck, Stargher King lands a POWERFUL BLOW to
	her head, sending her flying.  He lifts the stunned Catherine
	with one hand and pulls her face to his...

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		You cum back wif me god.  You be good
		bish-hor-kund...

	Catherine looks into his soulless eyes.  Then SPITS in them
	and BITES his face!  She breaks free as he YOWLS with pain. 
	He steps toward her, but his feet don't move.  The earth
	itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like
	concrete.  Stargher King HOWLS with frustration.

				CATHERINE
		My world...

	A SHIMMERING KNIFE seems to enrage from within her forearm,
	out the flesh and into her hand.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		My rules.

	She SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood.

				YOUNG STARGHER (O.S.)
		No!

	Catherine stops.  And turns to see the distraught Young
	Stargher.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		Don't hurt him!

	She spins around and sees not Stargher King, but MARTIN.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		He didn't mean it.  I was bad.

	Disturbed by the transformation, Catherine backs away.  Her
	vision blurs, the sound distorts.  And the earth cracks
	around Stargher King's ankles.

				YOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
		He teached me a lesson.  I deserved it.

	Fighting feelings of disorientation, she kneels before the
	child and rests the knife on the ground.

				CATHERINE
		No one deserves it, Carl.  No one.

	She reaches out to him, but the child is JERKED into the air
	by Stargher King.  In one hand, the monster holds little
	Carl.  In the other - a KNIFE.  His face and chest red with
	crimson, Stargher King fixes his eyes on Catherine with a
	predator's stare.

				STARGHER KING
		Yer world.  My knife.

	Stargher King raises the blade toward the boy's throat and -
	SNAP!  The strong arms of an adult Stargher breaks his arm at
	the elbow.  Both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground
	as Stargher King YOWLS like a stuck pig, the good arm
	cradling the other.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
		Me god hurt!  Why you do that?  Why?!

				STARGHER
		Enough.

	Stargher King regards him with disgust.

				STARGHER KING
		Enuff?!?!

	MARTIN STARGHER'S VOICE comes from the belly of the beast.

				STARGHER
		I'll tell you what's enough...

	Stargher and Stargher King square off.  The boy stands
	between them with the knife at his feet.

				CATHERINE
		Carl!

				STARGHER KING
			(still speaking as Martin)
		Shut up cunt.
			(to the boy)
		Give it here, worm...

	the child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking
	to Catherine for guidance.

				STARGHER KING (CONT'D)
			(as Martin)
		You want a mommy?  Is that what you
		want?

	In an almost dream-like motion, the child hands the blade to
	adult Stargher.

				STARGHER
		Enough.

	And he DRIVES the thing into Stargher King's heart.  For a
	brief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher
	King's.  Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with
	sad, troubled eyes.

				MARTIN
			(as Stargher King)
		Why?  What'd I do?...

	Stargher TWISTS the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher
	King drops dead.   Dead.  Young Stargher smiles and hugs
	Catherine.

				YOUNG STARGHER
		Time to go 'way.

				CATHERINE
		Carl...?

	The boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his
	arms and holds him close.

				YOUNG STARGHER
		Bye.

	She looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand.  He
	descends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his
	shoulder.

				STARGHER KING
		Thank you, Catherine.  You did help me. 
		More than you'll ever know.

	Man and boy disappear beneath the water's surface.  Catherine
	stands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. 
	She walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher
	and little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. 
	And FADE FROM VIEW.

				CATHERINE
		Goodbye Carl.

	She presses the sensor in her hand.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Miriam is shocked by what she sees on
	the monitors and looks at Stargher.

				MIRIAM
		He's in full arrest.

	Catherine quietly returns to consciousness and is
	automatically lowered.  She pulls the mask from her face,
	rises and opens the door.  Miriam races inside and
	desperately attempts to revive Stargher.  But it's no use. 
	Angry and stunned, she demands of Catherine.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		Help me!

	But Catherine chooses not to.  She knows Carl Stargher will
	never return to the world of the living.

	INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

	The chopper roars across the sky.  As they head northeast,
	away from the urban and toward the rural, Novak gazes out the
	window, trying to stay focused, fighting any after-effects of
	the drugs.  The pilot communicates via headset.

				PILOT
		Agent Novak?  Go ahead.

				NOVAK
		Cole?

	EXT. STARGHER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

	Cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting
	Suburbans.  (INTERCUT WITH NOVAK IN HELICOPTER).

				COLE
		The hoist was manufactured by Carver
		Industrial Equipment in 1982.  Serial
		number 117-337J.  Purchased by a boat
		shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to
		Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992...

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	The water is near the ceiling.  Kicking her legs to keep
	afloat, Julia DIGS with the ring and we see she has created a
	gap between the light fixture housing and an unused PIPE
	leading to the surface.  She pushes, but can't get anything
	to move.  The opening will get no bigger.  Julia sucks the
	last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell. 
	Searching for something, she finds a juice box and pulls out
	the drinking straw.

	INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY

	Shaken, but oddly transcendent, Catherine watches as
	Stargher's body is wheeled out of the lab on a gurney.  She
	comforts a whimpering Valentine and tells him...

				CATHERINE
		Everything's alright now, Valentine.  I
		promise.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Novak scans the topography of FARMS below, listening to a new
	report.

	INT. SUBURBAN - DAY

	Cole is the passenger, on the radio to Novak, A DRIVER next
	to him, doing about a hundred down the Interstate, SIREN
	blaring.

				COLE
		Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named
		Bainbridge who tired to build a machine
		works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends
		up in bankruptcy court and the state
		winds up with the land - it's just
		sitting there.

	INTERCUT WITH NOVAK

				NOVAK
		Delano?

				COLE
		Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal
		up the place?

				NOVAK
		You're kidding me.

				COLE
		I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says
		I'm too serious.

	Novak locates Delano on the map.

				NOVAK
		The exact location, Cole.  Give it to
		me.

	The pilot grins and pushes the copper to top speed.

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Julia is entirely underwater but alive.  She uses the straw
	to suck oxygen through the gap in the ceiling, but it's
	difficult to tread water and her lungs are aching.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Novak uses binoculars to scan farmland.  He searches.  And
	there it is: The abandoned farmhouse!

				NOVAK
		TAKE IT DOWN!

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs
	against the walls, but as she does, the straw slips from her
	mouth.  She reaches for it, but only succeeds in pushing it
	away from her.  It heads for the drain.  And disappears.

	EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

	The helicopter lands and Novak jumps out.  He knows this is
	the place.  He runs into the barn, but there's nothing, no
	sign of her.  The pilot looks at him with a true sense of
	loss.

	INT. THE CELL - CONTINUOUS

	As Julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny
	holes of the drain, we see for the first time an expression
	which tells us she's given up.  THUMP-THUMP-THUMP.  The cell
	starts to vibrate.  A repetitive noise WHUP-WHUP-WHUP - comes
	from above.  She swims to the top of the cell and POUNDS at
	the ceiling.

	EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

	Fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs, Novak
	pushes on.  Think, Peter, think... His eyes find the WATER
	TANKS and he SHOUTS at the helicopter.

				NOVAK
		Cut the engine!

	As the motor dies, Novak listens and listens.  There it is. 
	Water pipes beneath his feet.  And very faintly, a pounding. 
	He follows the sound, searching the earth.  It's clearer now,
	louder.  Novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to
	assist him.  Together, they expose the entrance to the
	underground sanctuary.

	INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM

	Novak drops to the floor below.  Instantly affected by the
	similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of
	Stargher's mind, he feels another wave of dizziness, but
	pushes on.

	And is hit hard by the sight of DROWNED JULIA, her motionless
	body floating past him.  HER EYES OPEN and bubbles drift from
	her nose and mouth.  Novak BANGS on the Plexiglas and calls
	to her.

				NOVAK
		JULIA!

	The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. 
	Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass. 

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		MOVE ASIDE!

	He pulls his gun and takes aim.  Julia swims to the top of
	the cell and presses herself against the ceiling.  BANG-BANG
	BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.  Novak fires a circle of shots into the
	thick plastic.  Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is
	still solid.  He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the
	bullet-damaged section.  CRACK! CRASH!  WATER POURS FROM THE
	CELL.  Julia's body descends on the torrent of water.  Novak
	reaches inside and pulls her to safety.  He's just about to
	give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks
	in oxygen.  Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor,
	the water from the cell spilling everywhere.

	EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE

	Cole's Suburban leads a contingent of FBI vehicles and local
	police cars onto the property, sirens blaring.

	INT. THE CELL - DAY

	Hearing the sirens, Novak relaxes.  For the first time in god
	knows how long, he relaxes.  And holds Julia Hickson as if
	his life depended on it.

										 FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

	Two cars parked outside.  An old, quirky Volvo and a Land
	Rover.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

	As a television plays THE WIZARD OF OZ, we find Catherine
	watching the movie from the couch, sitting up, drinking a cup
	of tea.  She looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a
	T-shirt, her CAT sleeping next to her.  IN THE KITCHEN,
	Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor,
	moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field
	of poppies...

				MIRIAM
		I left the nutritional information on
		the fridge door.  Read it.

	Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie. 
	Miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...

				CATHERINE
		I don't need them anymore...

				MIRIAM
		I know.

	But she leaves them just the same.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With
		dinner.

				CATHERINE
		Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...

				MIRIAM
		...give a kiss to Edward.

				CATHERINE
			(overlapping)
		Give a kiss to Edward.

	The women exchange smiles and Miriam exits.

	EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE

	As Miriam walks to her Land Rover, she sees a government
	issue Suburban park on the street and Peter Novak exit.

				MIRIAM
		Agent Novak.

				NOVAK
		Dr. Kent.

				MIRIAM
		You're looking well.

				NOVAK
		Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body
		good.
			(conspiratorially)
		I heard she got the approval to try the
		reversal with Edward.

				MIRIAM
		That's a secret.

				NOVAK
		Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. 
		We know all, see all...

	Novak opens the rear compartment of the Suburban and we hear
	something moving inside.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		How's the patient.

				MIRIAM
		Awaiting his arrival.

				NOVAK
		What about the cat?

				MIRIAM
		Completely unaware.

	Miriam's pager BEEPS and she hurries to her car.

				MIRIAM (CONT'D)
		I've got to go.  Good luck.

	Novak smiles, waves goodbye, and reaches into the Suburban.

	INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE

	As Dorothy and her companions confront the Wizard, there's a
	KNOCK at the screen door and Catherine sees Novak waiting.

				NOVAK
		Ready?

	Catherine cradles her cat.

				CATHERINE
		Ready.

	He opens the door and escorts a leashed VALENTINE into the
	living room.  Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides
	under the couch.

				NOVAK
		That went well.

				CATHERINE
		Give her a minute.
			(smiles at the dog)
		Hello, Valentine.

	Novak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine,
	licking her face, wagging his tail.

				NOVAK
		You sure about this?

				CATHERINE
		Absolutely.
			(calling for the cat)
		Abigail...

	Valentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base
	of the sofa.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		I heard Julia and John got married.

				NOVAK
		Yep.  Eloped.

				CATHERINE
		Good for them.

	Valentine settles on the floor.  Slowly, Abigail's curiosity
	gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's
	nose.  Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the
	cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort.

				NOVAK
		Well look at that.

				CATHERINE
		I told you.  You have to be optimistic. 
		Believe in them...

				NOVAK
		So you say.

	Amazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs.

				CATHERINE
		He's mine?

				NOVAK
		All yours.  My boss says it's one of the
		strangest requests the Bureau's ever
		had.

	Catherine laughs.  She likes that.

				NOVAK (CONT'D)
		He also says that until proven
		differently, Julia Hickson was found as
		a result of good old-fashioned detective
		work.

				CATHERINE
		It doesn't matter...

				NOVAK
		I don't know.  I think it does.
			(genuine concern)
		You know, Catherine... If you ever want
		to talk about it.  What happened to
		Stargher.  That last time.

	It's painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her.

				CATHERINE
		Not just yet.  Okay?

	Novak doesn't push it.  He just takes her hand and gives it a
	gentle squeeze.  The cat dashes into the kitchen and
	Valentine follows.

				CATHERINE (CONT'D)
		They're hungry.

				NOVAK
		I got it.

	He moves into the kitchen.  In a moment of quiet
	introspection, Catherine looks at the television screen, at
	Dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked Witch with a bucket
	of water, causing her to melt.  And she looks away, unable to
	watch, disturbed by the image.  She turns to the kitchen and
	sees Novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat.  He rises and
	returns to the living room.

				CATHERINE
		Thank you.

				NOVAK
		No problem.

				CATHERINE
		No.  Thank you.

	He smiles and nods, gently resting his hand on her shoulder. 
	Catherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him, comforted by
	simple human touch...

							 FADE TO BLACK.

                   Josh Trank and Max Landis



   FROM ANDREW'S FIRST CAMERA.

   CUT - to indicate time lapses within a scene


   INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

   The room is dingy. Unkempt. The camera sits on the bed, on
   its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around
   off screen.

   The door handle clicks; someone's trying it.    Then nothing.
   Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.

   Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.   He speaks
   with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          What do you want, I'm getting ready
          for school-

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
          Why is the door locked, unlock this
          fucking door right now.

   The bed stirs as Andrew sits down.

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I said unlock this door. UNLOCK
          THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR, NOW.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You're drunk-

                     MR. DETMER (O.S.)
          Listen, you don't tell me- IF I'M
          DRUNK, OR-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          It's seven thirty. In the AM.
          You're drunk, dad, that's crazy-

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
          What're you doing in there.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I'm filming this.

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
          What?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I bought a camera. I'm filming all
          your shit from now on.
                                                         2.


   There's a beat, and then we can hear Mr. Detmer moving away
   from the door.


   INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM

   Equally dingy. SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in
   bed. Andrew's filming her. She's clearly very ill, speaking
   in a weak rasp. Andrew now holds the camera.

                   ANDREW (O.S.)
          Mom? Will you say hi to the
          camera?

                    SANDRA DETMER
          Who's the audience?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          The millions of people watching at
          home.

                    SANDRA DETMER
          Hello world. Do I look awful?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          No, you look great.

                    SANDRA DETMER
          I've been looking a little better,
          yeah?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Oh yeah, definitely.

                    SANDRA DETMER
          It's a nice camera.

   EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING

   Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the
   street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon. Andrew
   carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into
   the passenger side of a car.

   In the driver's seat is MATT Garrety, 17, with messy hair.
   He's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the
   reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school
   intellectual.

                    MATT
          I got you egg salad.
                                                    3.


                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Oh, yeah, thanks.

                                                 CUT.

  They're driving.

                    MATT
          So...Should I ask about the camera,
          or-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I'm filming things now. I'm
          filming everything.

                    MATT
          You're filming everything.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          For my mom. I'm trying to get
          custody of her from my dad. She's
          getting worse, and he's
          not...helping, and this way, in
          case something goes down-

                    MATT
          He gets violent or whatever-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Right, it'd be evidence.

                    MATT
          Evidence. But you're not with him
          right now, but you're filming this.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Well, yeah, to add context.

                     MATT
          Context.   Andrew, you are...a weird
          dude.

                                                 CUT.

                    MATT (CONT'D)
          Did you ever read any Auguste
          Comte?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          What is that?

                    MATT
          He's this philosopher I'm reading.
                                                            4.


                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          For school?

                    MATT
          He's just like- his whole thing is
          about being positive and like,
          taking up for yourself. You should
          read him, maybe, it might make you
          feel- you know, improve your
          outlook.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Yeah, right.


EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - PARKING LOT

Andrew's getting out of the car, but then ducks back in to
see Matt lighting a pipe.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Are you not coming in?

                    MATT
          I'm gonna blaze a little first,
          yeah?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You're going to miss first period-

Matt turns on the radio, loud.

                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Okay, okay.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY

Andrew's filming himself putting stuff in his locker, and
does a quick sweep of the crowded school hallway.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          This is my school, I guess.   This
          is the hallway-

                    GIRL
          Vote "Kaz!"

A girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer.

                    GIRL (CONT'D)
          Vote Steve Kazinsky for Senior
          class president!
                                                            5.


                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          ...yeah-

                    GIRL
          Every vote counts.

Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and
featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before
something yanks the camera away.

For the first time we see ANDREW Detmer, 17, pale, awkward
and gangly, with long, stringy hair and thin, scraggly beard.
He looks anxious, if not afraid.

                    BRYCE (O.S.)
          Yo this camera is a piece of shit.
          It's like from 2004 or some shit.

WAYNE, 17, big and hateable in his Ed Hardy T-shirt, appears
wrapping his arm roughly around Andrew.

                    WAYNE
          Hey, how do I look?
              (starts muscle posing)
          Like this? Ooh, that's good.   Like
          this? That's sexy, right?

                    ANDREW
          Bryce, gimme my camera back-

                    BRYCE (O.S.)
          Fuck you Andrew, shut up.   This
          camera's a piece of shit.

                    WAYNE
          You got me, let's go.
Wayne turns and knocks everything out of Andrew's locker.
Bryce starts to walk away with the camera.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-

The camera is set down on the ground, and then abruptly
kicked back to Andrew. He picks it up, checking on it.

                    ANDREW (CONT'D)
              (quietly, sad)
          Oh come on...
                                                            6.


EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD

A view from the bleachers as the soccer team practices. The
cheerleaders are practicing too. We cut: a different view,
lower.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          This is where I eat lunch, out here
          on the bleachers.

                                                CUT.   LATER.

The camera's next to Andrew as he's eating, down on the
bench. A CHEERLEADER approaches.

                     CHEERLEADER
          Hi.

                     ANDREW
          Hey-

                    CHEERLEADER
          Could you not videotape us, please?
          It's really fucking creepy.

                    ANDREW
          I wasn't, videotaping you, so much
          as I was just-

         CHEERLEADER                           ANDREW
Just don't videotape-              -you know, filming what I do
                                   during the-

                    CHEERLEADER
          Don't videotape us, okay, or we'll
          call security. We see you watching
          us, we're not stupid, and it's
          sketchy, so back off.

                     ANDREW
          ...okay.

                    CHEERLEADER
          Is it on right now?

                     ANDREW
          Yes.

                    CHEERLEADER
          Turn it off.

Andrew turns off the camera.
                                                          7.


INT. MATT'S CAR

Matt's driving.   Andrew's filming from the passenger seat.

                    MATT
          There's a party tonight.    A barn
          party at Haven Hills.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I thought Haven Hills was closed.

                    MATT
          It's abandoned, yeah. That's why
          it's a good place for a party. Two
          kegs.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Why are you telling me?

                    MATT
          You wanna go? I don't wanna go
          alone.

                      ANDREW (O.S.)
          ...Nah...

                    MATT
          When was the last time you went to
          a party?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't like parties.

                    MATT
          You're a senior.     Just come, you'll
          have fun.
                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I'll think about it.

                    MATT
          Okay, right. Andrew, can I give
          you like, a pro tip?

                      ANDREW
          Yeah?

                    MATT
          Keep the camera at home.    It's
          weird.

                    ANDREW
          It has a purpose-
                                                           8.


                    MATT
          I'm trying to be a good cousin,
          here. This is me being your
          friend, yeah? Okay?


EXT. DETMER RESIDENCE

Andrew is filming as he walks along towards his house.

                    HOWARD (O.S.)
          Hey, what you doing?

                    COSTLY (O.S.)
          Hey nice camera bitch, gimme your
          fuckin camera!

The camera pans up to reveal HOWARD and COSTLY, moron
hoodlums, along with several friends, over by a car on the
other side of the road, drinking forties.

                    HOWARD
          Hey don't film me nigga, don't film
          me.

                    COSTLY
          Hey fuck off, you better run to
          your house, bitch. Run to your
          house and lock the door.

Andrew just stands there filming them. Howard hurls his
forty at Andrew, who doesn't move; it shatters very near to
him.

                    HOWARD
          The fuck, fuck you faggot-
Howard quickly starts crossing the street, and Andrew turns
and runs back towards his house.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

The camera lays on Andrew's bed again, filming the room.
Andrew is on his laptop at a desk, working.

                    ANDREW
          I'm uploading what I shot
          today...you have to keep a back-up,
          you know.

The door suddenly opens, revealing MR. Adrian DETMER, 40s,
Andrew's father. He doesn't look as white trash as you'd
expect.
                                                          9.


Andrew looks up at him, and then goes back to working.
Detmer goes over to Andrew and slaps him out of his chair.

                    MR. DETMER
          When I say open this door, you open
          this fucking door.

Mr. Detmer leaves, slamming the door on his way out.   Andrew
sits on the floor in silence.


EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - NIGHT

We're in Matt's car, driving on a dark dirt road, past an old
fence and rusted out farm equipment.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          Are you sure it's here?
              (beat)
          Are you sure it's here, this all
          looks closed-

                    MATT
          It's here, calm down.    Listen.

We can faintly hear party music.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          Oh yeah.


EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - BARN

Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and
Andrew approach. We see Christmas lights strung up, and
there's clearly a party going on inside the barn. Kids are
milling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around.

                     MATT
          Hey dude, don't follow me around
          all night.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          What?

                    MATT
          Don't follow me around all night,
          okay?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          What am I supposed to do? I
          thought you said you didn't want to
          go alone-
                                                          10.


                    MATT
          Talk to people?   Have a beer, I
          don't know.

                                                 MONTAGED
                                               FOOTAGE...

Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full
swing. Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking,
girls dancing sexy, guys joking around. Andrew is silent and
detached, just filming. He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16,
filming as well. They shout over the music.

                    CASEY
          Hey, what are you filming for?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Oh, I don't- just filming.

                     CASEY
          What?   I'm filming for my blog!

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          What?

                    CASEY
          I have a video blog!   Why are you
          filming?

Andrew simply backs away. More footage of the party.
AUSTIN, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere.   He's
clearly a little drunk.

                    AUSTIN
          Hey, were you filming my
          girlfriend? Yes or no, were you
          filming my girlfriend?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          No, I wasn't filming anyone
          specific, just filming the party.

                     AUSTIN
              (beat)
          Okay, good, because I don't wanna
          have to beat your ass.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          Okay.

                    AUSTIN
          Don't talk back to me. Don't get
          smart, okay, I'm being nice here.
          I'm being nice to you.
                    (MORE)
                                                          11.
                       AUSTIN (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Say okay.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          Okay-

                    AUSTIN
          Cause I know you were filming my
          girlfriend dancing. I should break
          your fucking nose, you know that?
          You know that, I should beat your
          ass right now, but I'm trying to be
          nice. Fuck you.

Austin abruptly throws his beer on Andrew, getting some on
the camera, and then spits on him. Andrew backs up, shocked,
lowering the camera.


EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODS

Andrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the
lens of the camera, obstructing our view. Cut to a few
moments later; the camera now resting in his lap or on the
ground. We can see the barn, the party still going on.

After a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
              (loud, sudden)
          Are you Andrew?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
              (startled)
          What-
                     STEVE
          Are you Andrew-with-the-camera?
              (beat)
          Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a
          camera?

The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17,
approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing,
instantly likeable charisma.

He's a little drunk and giddy.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)
          Dude, are you okay?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I'm Andrew.
                                                        12.


                    STEVE
          I'm Steve Kazinsky-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          No, I know.

                     STEVE
          ...yeah?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Everybody knows who you are.

                    STEVE
          Haha, yes, that is true. Listen,
          come on, bring the camera.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          What?   I don't-

                     STEVE
          Come on.

Steve starts off, but Andrew hesitates.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't-

                    STEVE
          Dude, come on, we found something.


EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - FIELD

Steve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass, toward
woods. It's rather dark.
                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Look, I don't think we're supposed
          to-

                    STEVE
          Is there a light on that?   On your
          camera?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-

The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with
it. The light clicks on, illuminating Steve.

                     STEVE
          Awesome.

                                                     CUT.
                                                        13.


They've reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the
remains of a fence. The light bounces around wildly.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          What were you guys doing out here?
          This is way out-

                    STEVE
          Me and your cousin were blazing a
          little.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Matt's out here?

                    STEVE
          A bunch of people were out here,
          but I think they've all gone back,
          now, cause we're like, obsessed
          with the thing.

                      ANDREW (O.S.)
          The what?

                                                     CUT.

They're in the woods now, thick and dizzying. It's near
silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground.
Steve walks out ahead.

                    STEVE
          Andrew Detmer, that's right.   I
          remember you from homeroom,
          Freshman year.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You remember that?
                    STEVE
          Yeah, I have a memory for faces.
          I'm gonna go into politics, which
          is ironic because I'm soooo fucking
          high right now- probably shouldn't
          be letting you videotape this-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I'm gonna be so rich when you're
          president, you have no idea-

                    STEVE
          Yeah, video footage of me luring
          you into the woods for gay sex-
          wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?
                                                        14.


                       MATT (O.S.)
          Down here!

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          Matt?

The camera turns to reveal Matt, standing next to some kind
of craggy hole in the ground, at the base of a hill in the
woods. It's big, but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to
the camera. It looks like a big black spot.

                    STEVE
          There we go. There it is.

                                                     CUT.

Andrew and Steve are now down with Matt by the hole. Andrew
is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness,
nervous.

                    STEVE (V.O.)
          Where is everybody?

                    MATT
          They all left.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          We're not supposed to be out here.

                    STEVE
          Is it still making the sound?

                     MATT
          Yeah.   Did you tell Andrew?

                    STEVE
          Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound-

                    MATT
          Here, listen.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          Guys-

                    STEVE
          You've got to get really close to
          hear it.

Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Guys, just don't like- don't push
          me, or do anything like that-
                                                         15.


                    STEVE (O.S.)
          You've got to go closer.     Like
          almost inside it.

There's a beat.

                    MATT
          We're not going to push you, we
          just wanna get it on tape.

Another pause. Andrew moves towards the hole. Even with
Nightvision, it's completely dark in there. A beat.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          Do you hear it?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          ...It's like, whispering?

                       STEVE (O.S.)
          Listen.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          Singing?

         MATT (O.S.)                       STEVE (O.S.)
Ooooh shiiiiit-                   That is so fucking creepy!

Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve.

                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          What is that?

                    STEVE
          We didn't dig the hole, man.
                    MATT
          Is the sound on the camera?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't know, probably...I mean,
          it's- it's kinda loud, right?

Matt looks to Steve.

                    STEVE
          Do you guys wanna go in and have a
          look, or what-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          No, I don't- I mean, I won't do th-

                    STEVE
          Hold your nose.
                                                          16.


Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into the
darkness.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          Hey, wait-

                    STEVE (FROM THE DARK)
              (faintly)
          Come on!

                    MATT
          Steve, come on, we don't know if
          it's stable in there- It's probably
          just the wind, we should-

Andrew abruptly goes into the cave.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Andrew, hey, come on!
          Don't...shit.


INT. THE HOLE

It's almost pitch black, but we can hear Andrew breathing.
It's claustrophobic in here. Eerily quiet. The camera
searches around, but the walls are tight in here, and low.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          Hello-

             STEVE                        ANDREW (O.S.)
   (suddenly appearing)           Aah!
I'm right here.

                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Does it go down much deeper, or-

                    STEVE
          Yeah, really far. It's not a cave,
          it's like a tunnel- do you hear how
          loud that's getting?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Do you think it could be like wind,
          or-

                    STEVE
          Come on, man. Come on.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Then what do you think it is?
                                                         17.


                   STEVE
          Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in
          ghosts.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Who said anything about ghosts.

Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.
Andrew follows.

                                                     CUT.

Matt's face is suddenly in front of the camera.

                    MATT
          -shouldn't have come in here.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Steve's up ahead-

                     MATT
          At first I thought this was a
          solutional cave, but now...I dunno,
          it's like a lava tube, or
          something.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

                    MATT
          Look at the walls. Look at how
          smooth they are. It's just
          straight shot down, I mean, we
          must've already gone forty or fifty
          feet-
                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Don't talk about it, you're making
          me nervous.

                    MATT
          You ever hear of Plato's allegory
          of the cave?

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          No.

                       MATT
          Nevermind.

                                                     CUT.
                                                           18.


Walking. Darkness. The cave is even tighter now. The light
flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out
completely We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the
nightvision mode comes on.

                                                      CUT.

The nightvision is scrambling badly.   All the forms are
distorted and then-

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          Can you believe this, this is NUTS-

The nightvision is turned off, revealing Matt. They've come
into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from
within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise
glow.

They speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can't
hear.

                    MATT
          Is that, is that showing up on the
          camera?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't wanna film it, it's messing
          with the camera-

Matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing next
to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing
from, or maybe embedded in, the wall. Around it, and him,
float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.

Steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the
light.
                       STEVE
          Touch one!

We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora
borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent
little explosion of light, beautiful.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...

A light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his hand
to extend to touch it. The subsequent little light burst
badly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.

                                                      CUT.
                                                           19.


Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed
up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow. The light
clouds have turned yellow. Matt is practically inside the
structure, pressing it with his palms.

                    MATT
          -changes color, see? It must be
          reacting to the heat, some kind of
          exothermic reaction-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          WHAT? I can't hear you over the-
          you know-

                    STEVE
          Make it change again!    This is
          awesome!

Matt presses with his palms. There's a low sustained hiss as
the light clouds turn an angry shade of red. A stream of
them is released from beneath the structure. The camera
jerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)
          AGHHHHH!

Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth
and nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly
and we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline
structure.

It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart,
revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; we
can suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and the
camera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the
tunnel-
                                             CRACK.   DIGITAL
                                                        CODE.

                                              BLACK SCREEN.
                                             HOLD ON BLACK.


FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.


EXT. MATT'S BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

The camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's
immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera.
It's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured
backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.
                                                        20.


                     MATT
          Ready?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Rolling, yeah.

                    MATT
          Okay, ball test.   Take one.

A baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing
Matt in the face; he drops like a rock.

                     MATT (CONT'D)
          OW FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!
          UNDERHAND!

Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can
hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.

                    STEVE
          I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-

                                                     CUT.

Now it's Steve who stands on the yard.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)
          Go.

A baseball comes in from off camera, slower. It comes down
towards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre,
impossible course correction, FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THE
FACE.
                     STEVE (CONT'D)
          AGH!   HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!
Matt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice-
pack to his face. Again, we hear Andrew laughing.

                    MATT
          WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-

                                                     CUT.

Andrew's out across the yard. He looks a little better; he's
gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is a
little better kept. He nods.

In flies the baseball. It abruptly stops in the air, a foot
and a half from Andrew's face. Steve and Matt let out a
cheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to show
a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and
Andrew.
                                                         21.


Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.   A trickle
of blood comes out of his nose.

                      ANDREW
          Ah, shit.

                                                      CUT.

The camera's on a tripod up on the back porch, filming
Andrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle. They are playing
catch...no hands. The ball simply flies from guy to guy.
They drop it a few times in some cuts, but shout
encouragement, and are clearly having a good time.

Finally, they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast.   Matt looks
up.

                      MATT
          Is-

Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew
rush to him, laughing.

                    STEVE
          `In the- penis- the penis-

                    MATT
          I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH
          WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?


INT. MATT'S KITCHEN

Steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving over
bread. The camera is set down on the counter, Matt and
Andrew watching.

                    ANDREW
          The trick is to pretend like it's
          on a plate. You get it on the
          plate and then you wrap the plate
          around it, and you can move it
          however you want.

                      STEVE
          Mhm.

                    MATT
          I've been pretending I was like,
          holding it in a fist, like a
          floating hand.
                                                          22.


                     ANDREW
          Yeah?   Plate's easier for me.

                    STEVE
          Guys, check it out.

Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter
floating freely. They slap together and then down onto the
bread, which slaps closed.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)
          Ha!
              (notices his bloody nose)
          Shit, shit-


INT. MATT'S ROOM - LATER

Matt's room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess.
Matt's sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling a
LEGO set with his telekinetic abilities. Andrew's filming
from the bed, where he's laying down.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Try to imagine that your squeezing
          the entire piece in your hand.

                    MATT
          That's what I'm doing, it's just,
          it's hard. You're better at this
          than me, you do it.

                    ANDREW
              (mocking)
          Really?
Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together.

                    MATT
              (wowed, laughing)
          Dude, holy shit!

                                                        CUT.

Andrew and Matt are laughing as Steve enters, holding out his
cell phone.

                    STEVE
          Guys, listen, listen.   Samantha.

Steve puts his voice-mail on speaker.   SAMANTHA Pezon, 16,
sounds a bit frustrated.
                                                  23.


                    SAMANTHA (ON PHONE)
          I know you're over at that guy
          Matt's house right now, okay, cause
          they said you didn't show up for
          soccer practice, but you said the
          only reason you couldn't come see
          Bound By Love with me was because
          of soccer practice, so...You know,
          I just, I don't know what to think.
          I feel like we never hang out
          anymore, you've just been hanging
          out with those two guys for the
          last like three weeks, and I...ugh,
          call me back.

                    STEVE
          What would you suggest, as like, a
          course of action for me, here?

                    MATT
          Why are you asking US for advice on
          girls?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Because we're his mistress.

Steve laughs.


INT. STEVE'S CAR - NIGHT

Steve is driving Andrew home.

                    STEVE
          -new camera's working out for you,
          that's good.
                                                CUT.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)
          I have to admit, though, I don't
          understand the filming thing.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          I told you, it's just my thing for
          right now.

                    STEVE
          You don't feel like it's a little
          weird? Like it puts a barrier
          between you and everything?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Maybe I want a barrier.
                                                     24.


                     STEVE
          Okay.   I respect that.

                                                   CUT.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          My dad is actually a fireman, or
          was, I don't know. He got injured
          like two years ago, and now they
          just pay him out of, like,
          insurance. He doesn't do anything,
          I mean he goes out during the day,
          but I don't know where. He drinks
          a lot.

                    STEVE
          So how do you pay for your shit?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I do computer repair, and stuff.     I
          actually make a lot of money...

                    STEVE
          What about your mom.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          My mom has spinal meningitis, she's-
          she can't work or anything, and the
          insurance doesn't cover all of her
          medicine, so a lot of my money has
          to go into that. I figure if I get
          enough on camera, maybe I can, I
          dunno, get custody of her or
          something.

Steve mulls this over.
                                                   CUT.

                    STEVE
          I've actually been having some
          problems with my parents, too.

                       ANDREW (V.O.)
          Yeah?

                    STEVE
          Nothing like yours, though.   Not-
          Never mind.

There's a long beat.
                                                           25.


                    STEVE (CONT'D)
          They've just been fighting a lot.
          I think my mom is cheating on my
          dad.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          ...That's intense.

                    STEVE
          Yeah. I know. I'm actually, yeah,
          I'm sure my mom is cheating on my
          dad.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          How-

                    STEVE
          I just, you know, I saw some stuff.
          It's weird, you don't think about
          your parents as like...people, or
          whatever. I don't know.

The two guys drive in silence.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)
          Don't tell anybody about that-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Haha no of course, no way.

                    STEVE
          Good.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
It's dark. We can hear shouting from elsewhere in the house;
"useless bitch," "carry your ass long enough," etc. Andrew
reaches over and turns off the camera.


EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD - BLEACHERS

Matt, Andrew and Steve are eating lunch on the bleachers.

                     MATT
          See last night, alone, I got my
          whole bed off the ground. No
          nosebleed.

                    STEVE
          Yeah, I was doing weights, too.
                                                        26.


                    MATT
          Weights, like-

                    STEVE
          Free-weights, a barbell. I got up
          to two hundred pounds before I
          bled.

                    MATT
          So it's, yeah, this is my theory-
          it's like a vagina. Like it's
          elastic, but if you stretch it too
          far too quick it'll tear-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Ew-

                    MATT
          And that's why we're getting
          better. We're loosening up.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Couldn't that metaphor just be for
          any muscle in the human body, like
          working out or-

                    STEVE
          No, I like braingina.   Braingina is
          the shiiiiit.

Steve floats up a bunch of chips from his bag, and then rapid
fires them into his mouth.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I think it's time we took this out
          of the backyard.
Matt and Steve look confused.


INT. STEVE'S CAR


Steve is driving, Matt's shotgun, Andrew's filming from the
back.

                    STEVE
          If anyone criticizes you, just call
          them a hater. It's like calling
          someone a racist, they'll just drop
          whatever they're complaining about
          and be like "I'M NOT A HATER."
          Nobody wants to be a hater.
                                                        27.



EXT. WAL-MART


Matt and Steve are walking in, Andrew lagging behind filming.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)
          Just stay back a little ways, yeah-

                      ANDREW (O.S.)
          I got it.


INT. WAL-MART

The guys are trying to stay out of sight, looking down an
aisle where shoppers stand.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          That girl, with the cart.

A frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling
on the cart. It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes
careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it. We
can hear the guys cracking up, trying to stay quiet.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          She's chasing- she's chasing it-

                                                     CUT.

Toy aisle. A toddler is looking at teddy bears.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I got this.
One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the
little boy. The little boy is wowed. The teddy bear suddenly
takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled
laughter.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          Oh my god Andrew, look-


Andrew pans up to reveal a woman at the end of the aisle; she
saw everything, and is looking around, wide eyed.

                                                     CUT.

They're by the check out.
                                                         28.


                    MATT (O.S.)
          See that guy chewing gum?


                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Umm...
              (camera finds the guy)
          Got him.

                    MATT
          I'm gonna get the gum right out of
          his mouth- watch this.

There's suddenly a little air ripple in front of the man's
mouth, and he's yanked face first into the gum and candy
rack, which all crashes apart. The guys all crack up and
start running.

                     STEVE
               (laughing)
          GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We
          don't need to run, we don't need to
          run!


EXT. FIELD - SUNSET

Matt sits on the hood of a car.   He and Andrew are flinging
rocks with their powers.

                    MATT
          That was a good one, you got that
          one far.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          Hey Matt.
              (beat)
          Do you like me?

                     MATT
          What?
              (beat)
          Sure, yeah. I mean, I didn't,
          always-

                      ANDREW (O.S.)
          Why not?

                    MATT
          Don't get mad, I mean, I like you
          now, I like you a lot. You're
          just, you're not super easy to talk
          to. You've got a lot of-
                                                         29.


                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You're an asshole.

                    MATT
          See, that's what I'm saying.
          You're hostile, man.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
              (beat)
          You know, you...If you hadn't
          invited me to that party, none of
          this would've happened.

                     MATT
          Yeah.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          Thanks.

Matt laughs.


INT. MATT'S CAR - AFTERNOON - WAL-MART PARKING LOT

None of the guys are visible.   They're filming a woman park
her car.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          I just always feel like I miss
          stuff.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          We were just sitting around
          throwing rocks, it was nothing.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Yeah, until all those chicks showed
          up.

                     STEVE (O.S.)
          What?   Shut up.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          Okay, here we go, here we go.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Are you sure there's no one around-

                     MATT (O.S.)
          There's no one, I just looked, just
          go, ready?
              (beat)
          Ready?
                     (MORE)
                                                        30.
                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Okay, Andrew, remember, get under
          it, you're the strongest, Steve get
          the sides, I'll get the front and
          back, we gotta do this quick.
          Countdown. Three. Two. One. GO.

The car the woman parked shakily lifts off, and immediately
dips right.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Steve Steve Steve-

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          Got it, got it.

Silence, and we watch as the car gets to about twelve feet in
the air, makes a full 180 degree rotation, and then wobbles
through the air over to a spot several spaces away, and then
sets down, neatly in place.

        STEVE (CONT'D)                  MATT (O.S.)
FUCK YEAH! BOOYAH!              YES! FUCK YES! OH SHIT,
                                blood-


EXT. WAL-MART - PARKING LOT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Matt is sitting against the car with a wad of kleenex on his
nose, soaked with blood. Steve is leaning nearby, with a
brown paper napkin.

                     MATT
              (beat)
          My braingina is having like
          a...face period.
                    STEVE
          Yeah, you got some from your ears,
          too. You've gotta start working it
          out more, Matt.

                    MATT
          Yeah man, in between my yoga.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You just need focus, Matt.

                    MATT
          Ha.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You're lucky you got the kleenex,
          I'm stuck with the taco bell
          wrapper.
                                                           31.


Andrew holds out said wrapper in front of the camera.

                    MATT
          That's like, at least twice as much
          blood as I usually see on a taco
          bell wrapper.

                    STEVE
          Guys, guys. Look.

The camera moves around to show the woman returning to the
space where her car was parked. She stops, baffled, and
looks around. We hear the guys stifle laughter.

She notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it,
looking around. Andrew tries to get a better angle, and she
notices him, and stares.

                       STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Ignore us!

                       MATT (O.S.)
          We're
              (beat)
          Mormons!

The woman stares a moment longer, and goes to her car.


INT. MATT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Matt's driving, Steve's shotgun, Andrew filming from the
back. It's raining.

                    MATT
          -sfucking insane, we just changed
          her life. We did-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Her face, I can't get her face out
          of my head.

                    STEVE
          That was fucking great. I mean,
          this just gives me so many ideas,
          already, stuff we could do-

There's honking from outside.

                    MATT
          Oh come on, what is this?
                                                           32.


                    STEVE
          He's like right on your bumper,
          too.

Matt rolls down the window and gives the signal to pass.
More honking.

                    MATT
          Can you fucking believe this guy?

                    STEVE
          He's just some asshole redneck,
          look at him. He's fucking with us.

They are driving out over a bridge in the woods.

                    MATT
          I don't know what to do, what
          should I-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
              (laughing)
          Here, take the camera, take the
          camera.

He hands off the camera to Steve; now we see Andrew sitting
in the back seat. Behind him, through the back window, we
can see a pick-up truck, honking, way too close.

                    ANDREW (CONT'D)
          Abracadabra.

Andrew flicks his hand at the truck. The effect is
instantaneous: THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK CAVES IN LIKE IT JUST
HIT A BRICK WALL, WHAM, AND SENDING IT CRASHING OFF THE
BRIDGE, OUT AND DOWN AND INTO THE WATER.
                    STEVE (O.S.)
          ...I...what...


EXT. THE BRIDGE

The camera is being held loosely at Steve's side;
everything's upside-down, and we can't see anything, but can
hear the guys are clearly freaked out.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          What the fuck did you do, man, what
          the fuck-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I didn't mean to, I didn't-
                                                           33.


                    MATT (O.S.)
          Fuck! SHIT! What's wrong with
          you, look at this, fuck!

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          Is he still in there? If he's in
          there we have to get him out-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Guys, just calm down, I'm sorry,
          okay-

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          Fuck that, take your fucking
          camera.

The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a
moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge;
the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet
below. We tilt up to see Steve taking off his jacket.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You don't have to- I mean I can-

Andrew raises out a hand, trying to telekinetically lift the
car. It rattles, and then Andrew groans in pain.

                    MATT
          Andrew, just stop, just stop doing
          things.

Steve dives off the side of the bridge.   Andrew films him for
a moment, swimming to the car.


INT. MATT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Andrew's filming Matt, who looks angry as he drives very
quickly.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Are you mad?

                    MATT
          Stop, just stop.


EXT. RIVER SIDE ROAD

Matt and Andrew pull up to see Steve dragging the REDNECK
ASSHOLE out of the water. They hurry out of the car.

                                                      CUT.
                                                          34.


Steve has the guy on the shore.    He's dazed and bleeding.

                    REDNECK ASSHOLE
          -what happened, cause...I don't
          know....my truck, my truck...

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Is he okay?

Steve just stares directly at Andrew.   Andrew pans to reveal
Matt, on a cell phone.

                    MATT
          Yes, just past White Crescent
          bridge. Down by the- yes-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Is that the cops, are you calling
          the cops?

                    MATT
              (ignoring him)
          Yeah, just come- no, I don't know.
          I don't know, maybe internal
          bleeding, or-

                                                       CUT.

Later. The cops and an ambulance have arrived. An officer
is talking to Matt, Steve and Andrew; the camera is held low.

                    LOCAL OFFICER
          -looks like he'll be okay. Lucky
          you guys were here. Is that on?
          You can go ahead and turn that off.
The camera shuts off.


EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Matt looks FURIOUS, while Steve just looks uncomfortable and
freaked out. Matt's car is parked nearby.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't see how you guys can be so
          angry-

                    MATT
          You don't see how we can be angry?
          You put a man in the hospital for
          fucksakes. You put a man in the
          hospital, you hurt somebody-
                                                           35.


                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          He was being an asshole- he- I
          didn't mean to-

                    MATT
          Which part of that do you mean, do
          you mean he was being an asshole,
          or was it an accident? Was it an
          accident, Andrew, cause you're the
          strongest. Listen, with this, we
          can't fuck around, ever.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Then what've we been doing, we've
          been fucking around-

                    MATT
          NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you
          can't use it on people, or hurt
          people like- Steve, help me out.

Steve seems lost for words.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I-

                    MATT
          We need rules, okay. Rule #1, you
          can't use it on living things.
          Rule #2, you can't use it when
          you're angry-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You can't just declare rules,
          you're not-
                     MATT
          I will fucking declare rules, okay?
          If we keep going, and getting
          stronger, we need rules. We need
          rules.
              (beat)
          Damn it Andrew turn off the cam-

                                              SNAP TO BLACK.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

It's morning. The camera lays on the bed.     Andrew can be
heard breathing.

                                                CUT.   LATER.
                                                          36.


The camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it
moves across the floor. It crawls up onto the side of the
bed, then onto the sheets. Andrew's finger points at it.

The spider is telekinetically lifted into the air.    It hangs
struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.

He spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates
into all of its component parts. They stop moving, hanging
lifeless.

Andrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider.    Rings
again.

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
              (from downstairs)
          Andrew! Answer the fucking phone!


INT. MATT'S CAR - STEVE'S STREET

Andrew's filming Matt from shotgun.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Did he say what it was about?   When
          he called, what did he say?

Matt's quiet.

                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Are you still mad at me?

                    MATT
          I'm not mad.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
              (beat)
          You seem mad.

                    MATT
          ...Power corrupts, is all I'm
          saying, man.

                    ANDREW
          What does that even mean?

                    MATT
          I just mean that we have to think
          about things more now, okay? We
          can't just DO things, we have to
          think first.

                    ANDREW
          ...I understand.
                                                           37.


                    MATT
          It's just- nah, nevermind, we're
          here.


EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

The house is big and nice, somewhat isolated.    Matt is
walking up ahead of Andrew to the door.

                      STEVE (O.S.)
          Hey kids.

Matt stops, and both Matt and Andrew look around.

                     MATT
          Steve?   Where are you?

                                                       CUT.

Steve is atop a power line pole, thirty feet in the air.
Andrew and Matt look up at him from the ground.

                    STEVE
          Just try it, it's easy.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          That doesn't look easy.

                    STEVE
          You throw yourself at the ground.
          You just fall, and catch yourself,
          and then it's easy, I swear. Don't
          try to jump or you'll flip
          yourself.
                                                       CUT.

Matt hurls himself at the ground, WHAM. Cut, and again,
WHAM. Cut, and this time he flips himself BAM WHAM.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Let me try-

                      MATT
          Yeah.    I'm done for now.

                                                       CUT.

Matt's now holding the camera, showing Andrew.    He checks the
street for cars.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          No cars, no cars, go.
                                                         38.


Andrew throws himself forward.   And stops, hanging in mid
air.

                     ANDREW
           Whoaaaamygod...whoaaa...

Matt moves in for a closer look at floating Andrew, and gives
a glance up at Steve, who's cheering on the telephone pole.

                     MATT
           HOLY SHIT DUDE! HOLY SHIT, DUDE,
           HOLY SHIT! HOLY...SHIT DUDE, HOLY
           SH-

                                                      CUT.


EXT. SKY

At first it's not clear what we're looking at, just blue sky.
Wind is very loud. The camera pans down to reveal we're FIVE
THOUSAND FEET IN THE AIR, in a clearing between two larger
cloudbanks.

The camera pans all the way down to show Andrew's dangling
feet, and below them, the impossibly far drop. We can hear
Andrew laugh.

                                                      CUT.

We can see Steve and Matt, nearby, now wearing winter-coats
and hats to keep warm. They're playing catch with a
football. Steve tosses it to Andrew, who actually goes into
a short dive to catch it. He looks up to see Steve and Matt
distantly cheering and waving their approval.
                                                      CUT.

Steve's holding the camera, filming Andrew attempting a few
fancy moves, but he's a clumsy flier. Matt does a few neater
tricks in some clips.

                      STEVE (O.S.)
           Hey Matt, you're finally good at
           something!

                      MATT
               (loud)
           What? The wind!

                     STEVE (O.S.)
           I said you're an idiot!

Matt gives the thumbs up, and Steve laughs.
                                                          39.


                    MATT
          It's about aerodynamics! If I put
          a barrier just in front of me, I
          can go way faster, cause it cuts
          wind resistance!

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          I can't hear a damn thing you're
          saying!

                     MATT
          Yeah!   Definitely!

                                                        CUT.

Steve and Matt are seen flying around, Steve further away,
near a large cloud bank. Matt is using his abilities to
shape cloud fluff into an M. There is a humming, rattling
sound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Guys, do you hear that?

Neither of the guys can hear him. Steve however stops in the
distance, looking around. He shouts something, inaudible.

                     ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          What?   I can't hear you!

Steve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging.

A BOEING 737 BLOWS OUT OF THE CLOUDBANK BEHIND STEVE.    He's
spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock.
Suddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the
camera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead.
The camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it
swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in
some tall grass. Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve
come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting
apart.

They lay there, breathing hard. Andrew sits up, coughing;
his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding. Steve suddenly leaps up.

                    STEVE
          WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA
          DIED, MAN! I ALMOST FUCKING DIED!

Steve grabs Andrew, shaking and hugging him.
                                                        40.


                      STEVE (CONT'D)
          You saved   my life, dude! Andrew,
          you saved   my fucking life! Is that-
          Holy shit   is that the camera?! You
                      AND THE CAMERA!?
          caught me

                    ANDREW
              (exhausted)
          Y- yeah-

                    STEVE
          FUCKIN' AMAZING!

Matt touches down behind them, frantic.

                    MATT
          What happened, are you-

                      STEVE
          Ahhhhh!

Steve joy-tackles Matt to the ground.

                    MATT
              (laughing)
          What the hell, what the hell-

Andrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera.

                                                     CUT.

They're all standing in the field; Steve is still wigging
out.

                    STEVE
          This is what people have wanted
          forever, since like caveman times!
          Do you understand, I mean do you-
          jesus christ, I can't even-
          Everything is fucking great! I CAN
          FLY! Matt, listen, just say it!

                    MATT
          ...I can fly.

                    STEVE
          Shout it out man!

                     MATT
          I CAN FLY.
              (realizes it feels good)
          I CAN FLY!

Matt stands, shouting out at the field.
                                                          41.


                    MATT (CONT'D)
          I CAN FUCKING FLY!

Andrew cheers from behind the camera, and Steve laughs.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          I CAN FLY!

                     STEVE
          FUCK.   YES.

                                              HOLD ON BLACK
                                              FOR A MOMENT.


EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT

Steve, Matt and Andrew are sitting around the pool outside of
Steve's house; empty beers are all around. All three are at
least tipsy.

Matt is up.

                    MATT
          Yo Andrew, Andrew, gimme a beat.

                      ANDREW (O.S.)
                (flatly)
          No.

All three crack up.

                    MATT
          That's cold, you're so cold! MY
          OWN COUSIN! DJ Steve, dial me up-
Steve immediately starts beatboxing.

                    MATT (CONT'D)
          Okay, yo, yeah, yo, you say you
          wanna get high you ain't high as
          me, you chillin' at yo mom's house
          I'm at four thousand feet, cauuuse

          braingina, and you better believe
          I'm a, frequent flyer, and you know
          I don't need no turbines, ladies

          president, straight outta Oregon,
          gotta, represent, Matt Garrety
          bitches, I'm the young Clark Kent.
                                                        42.


Steve and Andrew cheer and Matt takes a bow.

                                                     CUT.

The guys have broken open glowsticks, and Steve is filming as
Andrew and Matt manipulate snakes of the glowing fluid at
each other; it's beautiful.

                                                     CUT.

We cut between three sing alongs; "Shake That" by Nate Dogg
and Eminem (which Andrew protests too, as he doesn't know the
lyrics), "How You Remind Me" by Nickelback, and "Macho Man"
by The Village People.


INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The guys are in that sleepy mode, now. Andrew's filming, but
not really focusing on anything. Matt's sprawled out on a
couch opposite him. Steve's in a chair nearby.

                    MATT
          But how does she not notice?

                    STEVE
          Well, I mean, she notices that it's
          gotten better, definitely. You
          just have to be subtle.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          That's so cool. Doesn't that count
          as breaking rule #1 though?

                    STEVE
          Pfff, technicalities.
                    MATT
          Man, I haven't had sex since
          like...a year.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I haven't had sex since ever.

                    STEVE
          Ugh, man, you guys...how are you so
          cool?

                    MATT
          Liquid nitrogen.

                                                     CUT.
                                                      43.


Later. Drowsier. Light's coming from the TV. The camera is
laying haphazardly on Andrew. They're all nearly asleep,
drowsy drunk.

                     MATT (CONT'D)
           Hey guys, are you up?

                        STEVE
           Yeah.

                        ANDREW (O.S.)
           YO.

                     MATT
           Today was like...the best day of my
           life. Like I was thinking and I
           can't think of any day I liked
           better than today.

There's a silence.

                        ANDREW (O.S.)
           Yeah.

                        STEVE
           Unanimous.     Yes.

                     MATT
           Okay...good.

Beat.   Silence.


EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - THE CLEARING - MORNING

Time has passed; maybe two weeks. It's early. The hole is
clearly caved in; the entire area is slumped downwards.

                     STEVE
           Well that answers that.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
           I feel stupid now that I was scared
           to come back.

                     MATT
           Nah man, we were all- I mean, I
           was, definitely, yeah.

A POLICE OFFICER appears.

                     POLICE OFFICER
           Hey, you kids can't be here, okay?
           You gotta move on out.
                                                         44.


                       MATT
          What?

                    POLICE OFFICER
          The ground is unstable, we're
          cordoning the whole place off.


INT. DINER - MORNING

Steve is filming Andrew and Matt across the table.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          I'm live on scene here with Matt
          and Andrew, boys, can you tell us
          what's happening?

                    ANDREW
          Well, uh, it would appear that a
          Virgin Mary has appeared in the
          maple syrup on a young local man's
          pancake.

                    MATT
          In a second it will, wait...

Matt focuses, and we see his syrup form a Virgin Mary.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          That is, that is some very uh,
          definitely supernatural shit, going
          on there.

                                                     CUT.

                    MATT
          Well, when I was really little, I
          wanted to be police officer.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          Oh, no shit?

                    ANDREW
          Fuck you, pig.

                    MATT
          No, I just really got into on the
          idea of altruism, you know?

                    ANDREW
          What's that mean?
                                                           45.


                    MATT
          Like making things better for
          everyone.

                    ANDREW
          So what, you wanna do like, a
          charity? That's lame.

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          Why is that lame?

                     ANDREW
          I dunno.

                    MATT
          I mean, I'm not gonna- it doesn't
          matter, you know. I'm never gonna
          get out of this piece of shit town.
          You know, we're all just little
          pieces. One person can't really
          make a difference. I used to think-
          I don't know. I don't know.

Matt telekinetically lifts a spoon and rockets it at the
camera; it plinks off.

                     STEVE
          AAH!   DOUCHEBAG!

                                                     CUT.

Now Matt has the camera, filming Steve.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          So what's it feel like to be good
          at everything?
                    STEVE
          I'm not good at everything-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Name something you're bad at.

                    STEVE
          I'm not GOOD at everything, I just
          do my best at everything. That's
          what it's about. I mean you talk
          about philosophy and shit all the
          time, but you never really do
          anything. Have you even applied to
          colleges yet?

                    MATT
          I'll get to it-
                                                        46.


                    STEVE
          You could use some of that, man,
          I'm just saying.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          Oh yeah? Well you could use some
          shut the fuck up.

                    STEVE
          You lack initiative.

                    MATT
          You lack...a dick.


EXT. ROAD - LATER

The guys are walking along. Andrew's holding the camera
loosely, not really caring, they're chatting, it's chill.
Matt gets a text.

                    MATT
          Shit man, I got my mom's birthday,
          I gotta go.

                    ANDREW
          Say hi for me.

                    STEVE
          Later dude.

Matt turns and casually rockets off into the sky.

                     STEVE (CONT'D)
          What're you doing, where are you
          going now?
                    ANDREW
          Well I don't wanna go home yet.
          You wanna go into the city?

                    STEVE
          Ah, dude, it's rush hour.

                    ANDREW
          So?

There's a beat, and then Steve laughs.

                    STEVE
          Hell yeah, dude.
                                                          47.


EXT. PORTLAND - THE ROOF OF THE KOIN CENTER - SUNSET

They're 46 stories up, chillin' with milkshakes.   It's
fucking awesome. The city is beautiful.

                    STEVE
          I wish I could bring Samantha up
          here. She'd love this.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You still haven't told her?

                    STEVE
          Nah, no way. She'd freak out.

                                                       CUT.

                    STEVE (CONT'D)
          Mom's like, never home anymore. I
          mean, you saw how my dad is, he's
          just quiet. Sits around. I don't
          know. And talking to him about it
          is just pointless. He's got
          nothing to say.

                                                       CUT.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          And it's bad, because her pain gets
          real bad, you know, and we can't
          afford the good meds anymore. When
          I was little it wasn't as bad, but
          even then dad was still, you know,
          the way he is. I don't know. I
          don't know anymore. I don't know
          how to feel.
                                                       CUT.

                    STEVE
          It'll be fine, dude.    You'll figure
          it out.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          I hope so.

                    STEVE
          Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter
          break's coming up...You wanna do
          the talent show with me? Get you
          out there, you know, meet some new
          people.
                                                  48.


                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          No, I- I mean, no, that's not- I'm
          really shy, and I don't have any
          talents, or-

                    STEVE
          Yes you do, you have a talent, you
          have a talent.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
              (getting it)
          ...Oh, no way. No way-


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM

Sandra's in bed, sicker than ever.

                    SANDRA DETMER
          You look handsome.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Yeah, Steve chose my clothes, he's
          gonna do my hair.

                    SANDRA DETMER
          I'm glad you are spending so much
          time with your friends.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Oh yeah, me too.

                                                CUT.

Andrew's camera is down at his side.
                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
          -getting to school?

                    ANDREW
          I don't know what you mean-

                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
          Don't bullshit me idiot. Matt
          doesn't come, he don't drive up.
          You leave the house, and who the
          fuck is giving you rides to school?

                    ANDREW
          Matt.
                                                        49.


                    MR. DETMER
          No, wrong. Something's fucking
          going on with you, you can't hide
          it. Think you can slink around,
          sneaking- sneaking around the
          house, smiling, I know your shit.
          And we ain't got no more fucking
          money for your mother's pain
          medication, either.

                    ANDREW
          ...I'm sorry, I'll try to-

                    MR. DETMER
          Sorry isn't good enough, fuck up!
          You're a fuck up. You fuck
          everything up. Put that fucking
          camera away-


INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - AUDITORIUM

At first, it's just a shot off Matt's feet, the camera
pointing down, and we can hear hub-bub all around. It goes
to nightvision for a moment, then over-exposes, then back to
normal.

                    MATT (O.S.)
              (grumbling)
          Fuck...the stupid...

The camera is levelled, showing a high-school auditorium's
stage. A group of kids are playing screamo music. Cut, a
little later. A girl is singing. Cut. Casey, the girl with
the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty
dancing. She's good. The camera lingers on her.
                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          ...s'fuckin awesome...

                                                     CUT.

It's a few minutes later. "Techno-Syndrome" (MORTAL KOMBAT!)
begins to play. There's a beat, and then Steve, in a tuxedo,
rushes out onto stage. The applause is DEAFENING, girls
screaming, etc.

He raises his hands for silence, and then "presents" Andrew,
also in a tuxedo. Mixed reaction from the crowd. Andrew's
carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto
the floor. Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in
exasperation.
                                                          50.


Andrew shrugs, and all the cards leap back up into his hands.
There's a beat, and then the audience goes APESHIT.

                     MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Yes!   Fuck yes!

                                                     CUT.

Andrew is juggling, six balls at once. Steve is drinking a
soda, and offers Andrew the soda. Andrew is annoyed. Steve
pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda. Andrew
stops juggling, leaving all the balls hanging in the air, and
snatches away Steve's soda.

Steve lunges after him and gets back his soda, only to have
all the balls drop out of the air and hit him. The audience
is LOSING THEIR FREAKING MINDS.

                                                     CUT.

People around Matt are buzzing about how awesome it is.

Andrew is transporting buckets of water across the stage,
spilling water everywhere. Steve is pantomiming anger at the
shoddy job he's doing. Andrew pantomimes "Well, you try."
Steve tries, but trips and falls, sending the contents of the
bucket flying out over the audience-

-only for it to seemingly REWIND back into the bucket!    The
place GOES BERZERK.

                                                     CUT.

Steve and Andrew take their bows to overwhelming cheers,
separately. Andrew bows again, and people freak out. We
hear Matt cheering behind the camera.

INT. MATT'S CAR - NIGHT

Andrew's filming from shotgun.

                    MATT
          Just amazing dude-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You really think so-

                    MATT
          Are you fucking kidding, I've never
          seen a reaction like that in the
          auditorium, you guys- it was
          fucking like- it shook the
          building. You guys are rockstars.
                                                        51.


                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Yeah, it did- it did feel like
          that. All the girls screaming-

                    MATT
          Ah, see, here's the first stage of
          your downfall, hubris.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          What's that?

                       MATT
          What?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          What's "hubris?"

                       MATT
          Seriously?

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          What "seriously," fuck you
          seriously!

                    MATT
              (laughing)
          I'm sorry, I'm sorry-

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          Hey Matt.
              (beat)
          What's "seriously" mean?


EXT. HOUSE PARTY
It's a house party, raging. Steve's out on the porch with
his girlfriend SAMANTHA, 16, super hot, of course.

                    SAMANTHA
          AAAH ANDREW!

Samantha runs down and embraces Andrew, knocking around the
camera.

                       SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          Hi Matt!

                    MATT
          Hi Samantha!
                                                        52.


                    SAMANTHA
          Everybody's freaking out, you've
          gotta come in here-

                                                     CUT.

We see shots of the house party, which is rocking. People
keep coming up to Andrew and telling him "That was awesome!"
Or "You fucking rock!" Andrew sheepishly acknowledges this.
Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing
is talking. This is MONICA, 16. She's a little drunk.

                    MONICA
          Just fucking amazing. Magic is so
          hot. Do you know, me and my mom,
          in Vegas, went to a magic show, but
          they didn't have anything like
          that.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time
          practicing-

                    MONICA
          Do you not remember me, at all?

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          What?

                    MONICA
          We took American History together.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Oooh, oh yeah, your hair was
          different; it was blue, right?
                     MONICA
          Yeah!

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Monica, yeah-

                     MONICA
          Yeah!   Hiiii!

                                                     CUT.

More shots of the party, of Monica talking. She entreats
Andrew to join her on a beer-pong team. A little tipsy,
Andrew agrees, setting down the camera on a couch. It lays
there. SOME GUY picks it up.
                                                        53.


                    SOME GUY
          And now, you get a special treat,
          I'm gonna film myself taking a
          piss.

Matt snatches away the camera from him.

                                                     CUT.

Matt's walking around with the camera now he films people
dancing, talking, a people taking shots. Casey passes,
filming for her video blog. Matt's camera follows her, but
then goes back to Steve, who's cheering on Andrew and Monica,
who are of course dominating at beer-pong. But they take
shots anyway.

                                                     CUT.

                    STEVE
              (drunk)
          Matt, you have the camera yeah?
          You have the camera, cause, don't
          let him forget the camera, okay?
          That's Andrew's camera.

                      MATT (O.S.)
          Right on.

                                                     CUT.

Matt wanders the party; a stoner comes up.

                    STONER
          Hey Matt, wanna blaze?

                     MATT (O.S.)
              (beat)
          No, I'm good. I'm just filming for
          Andrew.

                    STONER
          Andrew? He's upstairs in the
          bedroom hooking up with that,
          whatshername, hair girl.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          Yeah, I'm a little drunk though.
          Movies! Makin movies.

The stoner wanders off.

                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I'm making an experimental film.
                                                        54.


EXT. HOUSE PARTY - PORCH

Matt turns the camera around to film himself.

                     MATT
          Hey Andrew, hope you're seeing
          this. Congratulations, sir. I'm
          drunk, sorry. I was really worried
          about you, like, before everything,
          but I do feel like...
              (beat)
          I feel like this will get better
          for you, man. I'm sorry I haven't
          been there for you as much, you
          know, when we were growing up,
          because, I know you could be an
          angry...be an angry dude. But I
          love you, you know. Detmer-Garrety
          extended family for liffffeeeeee.
              (beat)
          But listen when did I become the
          one who's...who's out alone filming
          myself, with the camera-

                      CASEY
          Hey Matt.

The camera spins to reveal her, and then immediately drops to
Matt's side.

                    CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          What were you filming?

                    MATT (O.S.)
          Just a thing, it's nothing like-
          you know, Eye Of The Storm or
          anything-

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          You watch my blog?

                    MATT (O.S.)
          I- yeah, a lot of people do. I've
          actually been stalking you since
          like, sophomore year- sorry, use of
          the word stalking-

                    CASEY
          Stockings are why I love Christmas.
          You wanna get outta here? This
          place is too loud for me.
                                                          55.


                    MATT
          Yeah, I- YES- yeah, just gotta drop
          off the cam-

Matt fumbles with the camera, turning it off.

                                               BLACK SCREEN.
                                              HOLD ON BLACK.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - MORNING

We can hear it raining hard outside.

The camera is laying on its side on the floor, and turns on
when Andrew fumbles with it. There's screaming from
downstairs; long and low, real pain sounds.

Andrew drops the camera and rushes out the door.    The camera
lays on the floor. Time passes.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
              (faintly)
          Mom, it's going to be okay, okay?
          Just try to get through, it's going
          to be okay.

Mr. Detmer enters, and notices the camera.    He reaches down
and picks it up.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM

In the squalid living room of the Detmer residence. The
camera is being held off at an angle by Mr. Detmer, as Andrew
tries to get it back. It moves around a bit, so Andrew and
his father are both on/off screen.

                    MR. DETMER
          -think you can fucking use me,
          you're abusive, you're a fucking
          user little piece of shit. I went
          through your camera.

                    ANDREW
          What'd you...You- what'd you see?

                    MR. DETMER
          Just you fucking being a drunk
          mess, spending my money, drinking
          with your fucking friends-
                                                           56.


                    ANDREW
          I didn't spend any of your money,
          RICHARD-

                    MR. DETMER
          Cause I don't have any fucking
          money to spend, it all goes to
          school for you, for medication for
          your mother-

                    ANDREW
          School doesn't cost any money, I go
          to public school you idiot-

                    MR. DETMER
          -now we can't afford your mother's
          pain meds anymore, up there
          screaming- did you just- what THE
          FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME? CALL ME
          A FUCKING IDIOT?
Mr. Detmer hurls the camera directly into Andrew's face.    It
knocks him down and clatters to the floor.

                    ANDREW
              (clutching his face)
          You asshole, you fucking crazy
          asshole-

                    MR. DETMER
          GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! YOU'RE DONE
          LIVING HERE, GET OUT!

Detmer rushes up to Andrew and slaps him, and again, and
again, and again, and WHAM! Andrew backhands Detmer HARD,
flooring him. Andrew turns and picks up the camera, leveling
it coolly on his father as he tries to stand.

Andrew's arm snakes out and grabs Detmer by his throat,
lifting him easily and slamming him against the wall.

                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
          I can't- can't move-

            ANDREW                        MR. DETMER
I COULD CRUSH YOU. YOU KNOW     Get- off- let me go- you're
THAT, I CAN FUCKING CRUSH       hurting me-
YOU. I CAN KILL YOU WITHOUT                                      *
EVEN FUCKING TOUCHING YOU.

Andrew turns and flings Mr. Detmer into the sofa, which flips
on the impact. We can hear Andrew's gasping sobs, panicked,
as he turns, runs out of the house, and LAUNCHES INTO THE
AIR.
                                                        57.


EXT. THE THUNDERSTORM

Andrew's just below the clouds, massive dark and ominous
above him. It's clearly not safe, rain and wind whipping his
body, lightning crackling inside the clouds. We can hear him
breathing hard.

He touches the bottom of a cloud, and gets a powerful
electric shock, forcing him to back off a tiny bit.

                     STEVE (O.S.)
          HEY!   HEY ASSHOLE!

The camera turns, showing Steve, in a rainslicker, flying up
to meet Andrew.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Where's Matt?

                    STEVE
          We have to get down from here right
          now, Andrew! This isn't safe!

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          Where's Matt?

                    STEVE
          Hung over, dude! You should be
          too! Let's just-

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          No!

                    STEVE
          What the fuck are you doing?
                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          I'm filming the storm, no one's
          ever filmed a storm like this up
          close bef-

                    STEVE
          No, we're getting the fuck down,
          now. This is fucking crazy, Andrew-
          what- what happened to your face?

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          ...My dad-

                    STEVE
          Your dad fucking beat the shit out
          you! Come on, we'll go to the
          cops, let's get out of here. He
          can't do that Andrew.
                    (MORE)
                                                           58.
                    STEVE (CONT'D)
          This is not the way you handle it,
          we'll go together, let's go, he
          can't do that-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          You don't give a shit, stop acting
          like you care!

                    STEVE
          I don't fucking care!?    You're my
          best friend, idiot!

                      ANDREW
          ...What?

                    STEVE
          I hang out with you and Matt
          practically every fucking day! You
          think I talk to anyone else about
          my parents, or my feelings on shit,
          are you that fucking insecure?

                    ANDREW
              (long beat)
          I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh
          god, I'm sorry-

                    STEVE
          Dude, it's okay.     You just need
          help, okay?

                    ANDREW
          Yeah, yes, I don't know what I'm
          doing-

                    STEVE
          It'll be fine. But we've- ...Do
          you hear that? I hear...singing.

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHTNING STRIKES STEVE, BLASTING HIM OUT
OF THE SKY. The boom of thunder is deafening.
For a moment, all we can see is the stormscape, and then we
hear Andrew's rushed, panicked breathing.

                                                      DIGITAL
                                                DISTORTION TO
                                                       BLACK.


EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

It's a gray, dark day. A funeral is in progress; we're
filming from within the mourning party.
                                                             59.


A large picture of Steve is on a stand as the priest reads a
eulogy. Andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight and
confined, back to how they were when we first started.

We see Steve's mother and father. His mother is sobbing.
His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.
Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.
There's Samantha, crying uncontrollably. The camera passes
Matt...

Who's staring directly at us.

                                                       CUT.

Andrew walks along in the cemetary, filming tombstones.

                     MATT (O.S.)
           What are you doing? Filming
           graves, I don't get it.

The camera looks up at Matt.    He's keeping his distance.

                     MATT (CONT'D)
           You're not returning my calls, why
           aren't you returning my calls.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
           I've been busy.

                     MATT
           No you haven't. Why aren't you
           returning my calls. Turn off the
           camera.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
           ...No.
                     MATT
           Turn off the camera.

Silence.

                     MATT (CONT'D)
           I had a missed call from you, that
           morning. And from Steve. I
           listened to your voicemail. No
           voicemail from Steve.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
           I was upset.
                                                60.


                    MATT
              (long beat)
          How do you get struck by lightning
          during a storm with no recorded
          lightning strikes?
              (waits, nothing)
          You can look that up online, you
          know, they keep track of it. I
          looked it up. Zero. And they find
          him out in a field, why would Steve
          go out in the middle of a field
          during a lightning storm?

The camera shifts a little.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't know-

                     MATT
          What?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't know-

                    MATT
          No, no, you do know, you do know, I
          think you do know.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't.

                    MATT
          What happened, Andrew. Just stop,
          stop lying to me, and tell me-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I'm not lying, I don't know what
          happened-

                    MATT
          I don't believe you, okay! I don't
          believe you, I want you to- put the
          fucking camera down.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          No, why-

                    MATT
          Because I want to talk to you. Put
          it down- put it down, Andrew,
          please- put it down, turn it off,
          put the fucking-
                                                         61.


Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull
the camera away. He's suddenly shoved backwards; Matt
recovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew. The
camera hangs limply for a moment.

                    MATT (CONT'D)
              (breaking down a little)
          What did you do, Andrew? What am I
          supposed to do? Who am I supposed
          to tell, about this, man? Who do I
          tell? I mean- I don't, I don't
          know how I'm supposed to- Why won't
          you just tell me what happened?

The camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketing
away from Matt.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

The camera is on Andrew's dresser, near his mirror.   Andrew
suddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife.

                    ANDREW
              (addressing the camera)
          -wanted to show you what I was
          talking about.

Andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm. He
takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh
of his wrist. He drags the blade down hard, all the way to
his elbow...but no cut appears. He then violently jabs
himself several times...but no penetration.

                    ANDREW (CONT'D)
          See, it's- I put a little sheet
          between myself and the knife, and
          the barrier, the sheet, is too
          strong. The knife can't cut it. I
          mean like, what I'm saying is if I
          concentrate, I can't be hurt. I
          can't be injured. Because of the
          little sheet.


EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD

Andrew sits alone on the bleachers. The cheerleaders are
practicing. The camera zooms in on Samantha. She sits alone
on the sidelines, watching numbly.
                                                        62.


INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY

Andrew is putting his stuff away in his locker. He's
suddenly shoved into the locker roughly. The camera turns,
revealing Wayne walking away.

The camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly, then goes
back to Wayne, now almost twenty feet away.

                       ANDREW (O.S.)
          Hey Wayne!

                    WAYNE
          What, you got a probl-

One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly
gushes blood. Wayne screams, falling, and is immediately
tended to by other students.


INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - BATHROOM STALL

Andrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of
the toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one.

They're Wayne's bloody teeth.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          See, this one, I got clean, cause I
          did a little lasso around the root,
          but these two, they're broken cause
          I think I pulled them from the
          middle. Matt was always better at
          the little, the intricate stuff, he
          got good at that. See how broken
          it is, ugh, sloppy.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE

Mike FERNANDEZ, 30s, serious but warm, sits across the desk
from Andrew. The concern in his voice is very real.

                    FERNANDEZ
          Could you put the camera away?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          No, I'm filming this. I film
          everything.
                                                       63.


                    FERNANDEZ
          I understand that things have been
          very hard for you recently, Andrew,
          but the camera kind of- it
          alienates a little, you know?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          What did you want to talk about?

                     FERNANDEZ
              (beat)
          There's concern for your grades,
          Andrew. And as far as I know
          you've yet to apply to any
          colleges, so-

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          It's not doable. Financially,
          they're not- I mean, my dad didn't
          go to college either.

                    FERNANDEZ
          Well, yes, but I still think it's
          worth thinking about. There are
          three different community colleges
          locally that offer great programs
          for-

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          I don't need college, Mr.
          Fernandez.

                     FERNANDEZ
              (beat)
          I think that's a very close-minded
          attitude, Andrew. I know that you
          come from a difficult background,
          and I know how horrible the pain
          can be when you lose a friend. But
          I don't think you should let this
          make you lose hope. I mean, this
          is your future. You don't want to
          compromise your future.
              (long beat)
          Andrew?


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM

The camera is sitting on the floor. We can hear screaming
from downstairs. Andrew picks up the camera, and goes to the
mirror, filming himself filming. After a beat, he steps out
from behind the camera, leaving it hanging in the air.
                                                         64.


He stands looking at himself, and then the camera. The
camera turns to face Andrew. He doesn't look good, but gives
a weak smile.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - MS. DETMER'S ROOM

We're peeking in through the door. We can see Sandra Detmer
writhing around in agony in the bed, moaning in pain. She
lets out a long scream, and then seems to notice us watching.

                    SANDRA DETMER
          Richard is that you? Richard, you
          have to let me have my medicine, I
          can't...Andrew? Who is that?
          Look, please come in here, I need
          help to turn over. It hurts,
          please, Andrew, you have to tell
          your father...tell your father to
          get my medicine...

Sandra, her eyes closed in pain, is lifted and rolled onto
her side.

                    SANDRA DETMER (CONT'D)
          Andrew...thank you Andrew...was
          that you? Did you-

The door closes.


EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

The junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old
equipment. The camera sits awkwardly on the hood of a
wrecked car as Andrew fidgets to get it mounted. The area is
lit by lights from the main building, not too far away, but
you can tell he's not supposed to be in here.

                                                      CUT.

Andrew moves out in front of the camera. He telekinetically
pulls an old car forward, and lifts it easily. He moves it
left, moves it right, rolls it, sets it back down.

                                                      CUT.

Andrew is sitting, resting, tired.   He speaks directly to the
camera.
                                                          65.


                     ANDREW
          I've been doing a lot of reading,
          like you know, online, about
          evolution, and the way it works,
          and you know, natural selection.
          The uh...
               (cut)
          The strongest animals will always
          survive, and they're the ones that
          you know, will prosper, or grow,
          and survive, by feeding on the
          smaller animals. And as humans we-
          see, there's...uh-
               (cut)
          There's this thing called an Apex
          Predator, and basically what that
          is the most powerful predator in an
          ecosystem. And humans, you know,
          we're the apex predator, because
          there's nothing that preys on us,
          cause of weapons and stuff. But if
          something could, I bet it would.
          I...
               (cut)
          I mean, what I'm trying to say is,
          a lion doesn't feel guilty when it
          kills a gazelle. You don't feel
          guilty when you squash a fly, you
          know- I think that means
          something. I think it really means
          something.

                                                      CUT.

Andrew's back out with the car. He lifts it again, then
makes a quick "squeezing" motion. As he does this, the car
violently compresses down to the size of a basketball.
Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, which
collapses loudly.

Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as
he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which
bites him twice before he's able to fling it off.

The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand,
blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly.

Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off.


FROM CASEY'S CAMERA.

Everything is crisper, cleaner, brighter.   Higher resolution.
                                                           66.


INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM

We're looking at the door to a bathroom, only a crack open.
It's pushed open, revealing Matt, shirtless, brushing his
teeth.

                      CASEY (O.S.)
            AHHHH!

Casey runs up and hugs Matt from behind, startling him.


INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Matt is cooking; he's got four different things on the stove.

                      CASEY (O.S.)
            How'd the interviews go?

                      MATT
            I told you how the interviews went.

                      CASEY (O.S.)
            But now we do it for the camera.

               MATT                         CASEY (O.S.)
UGHHHHHH-                        Come on.

                      MATT
            UCONN not so good, Columbia was
            good, University of Miami was
            really good, Arizona State was
            okay.

                      CASEY (O.S.)
            Who ended up paying for all of the
            airfare? Did your parents-

                      MATT
            Haha, no, I told you they wouldn't.

                      CASEY (O.S.)
            Did you pay?

                      MATT
            Nope. Nobody. I flew myself.      I
            needed the exercise.

                       CASEY (O.S.)
                (beat)
            You are a man of mystery.

Matt smiles.
                                                        67.


                    CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          God, how do you always cook so many
          things-

Matt snatches the camera away from her, turning it to reveal
that she's topless; Casey has already covered up with her
arms.

                    CASEY (CONT'D)
              (running away)
          AAH! AHH OH MY GOD MATT AAAHHH!

                                                     CUT.

They're at the breakfast table. Matt's eating, and Casey,
filming, is talking between bites.

                    CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          You have to do at least one of your
          tricks for the camera, though.

                    MATT
          I am so sick of being filmed, you
          have no idea, Casey-

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          No I know, but I'm not going to use
          any of this. I just want you to do
          a trick, one of your good ones.

                    MATT
          When do your parents get back from
          Spain?

                       CASEY
          A week.
                     MATT
              (beat)
          Okay, if you don't film me for one
          week-

                       CASEY (O.S.)
          Ahhhh-

                    MATT
          One week, I'll show you my new
          trick. I guarantee you will shit
          bricks. Yeah?

                       CASEY
          ...Ughhhh.
                                                         68.


INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - CASEY'S BEDROOM

Matt's asleep in bed on a different day.   Casey's filming
from next to him.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
              (whispering)
          I'm filming you and you don't know.
          I'm terrible. I'm gonna show you
          this later and you're gonna be like
          "whaaaaaaaaaat!"


EXT. CASEY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD

Matt runs out ahead of the camera, and does a little shuck-
and-jive boxer dance.

                       CASEY (O.S.)
          You ready?

                       MATT
          I'm ready!

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          Are you sure-

                    MATT
          Let's do it! Woo!

Casey raises a paintball gun out ahead of the camera. She
fires. Matt's arm whips out, impossible fast. He holds up
the caught paintball.

                     CASEY (O.S.)
              (awed)
          Holy shit, Matt.

                     MATT
          COME ON!   BRING IT ON!

Casey fires several more shots, Matt catches them
effortlessly, then hurls them all into the air. Mid-air,
they all pop, some of the paint landing on the camera and
Casey.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
              (laughing, awed)
          Matt, oh my god, oh my god!
                                                        69.


INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - CASEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark; the camera turns on, then the light, revealing
Matt, groggy, half awake.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          What happened?

                    MATT
          Ughhhh camera...I had that dream
          again.

                     CASEY (O.S.)
          Tell me.

                    MATT
          It's like I'm...I'm not me, I'm
          something else. And I'm out in
          this...out in space. And stars are
          all around me, and I'm zooming past
          them; everything is really like
          three-D, I can see the shape of the
          stars. I'm looking for somewhere
          to sleep, or something, and I see
          earth, and I go down to earth. And
          then...I don't know, just the main
          part is that I'm out and there are
          the stars and they just look like
          millions of little points of
          light...And Steve is there.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          Steve is there?

                    MATT
          Yeah but he feels like he's not
          part of it. Like he's there
          separately, inside my head. Andrew
          is there too. I don't know. I'm
          worried about Andrew.
              (beat, slyly)
          Why don't you put the camera away?

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          Oh yeah? What's gonna happen to me
          if I put the camera away-

                    MATT
          Oh I think you know. I think you
          know what's going down.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          We could leave the camera on.
                                                          70.


                    MATT
          You arrrrreeee...C'mere.

Matt advances on Casey, and the camera falls off to the side
of the bed. We can hear her giggling, which is abruptly
muffled by kissing.

EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

The camera is aimed at Steve's tombstone. There are still
flowers and memorials spread around. Some are rotting. The
camera moves around a little, then back to Steve's tombstone.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Screaming from Sandra's bedroom. The heater rattling. The
TV from downstairs. There's a knock on the window. The
camera is picked up, to reveal Matt floating outside, looking
around nervously.

After a moment, Andrew opens the window.

                                                       CUT.

Matt stands fidgeting, clearly uncomfortable, as Andrew films
him.

                    MATT
          You haven't been returning my
          calls, so I thought I'd just...you
          know, ambush.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          That's rude.

                    MATT
          I just- I've been getting, you
          know, bad vibes or whatever.

Andrew is silent.

                    MATT (CONT'D)
          I know you stopped coming to
          school, and my mom said you guys
          are having a lot of problems with
          money. I'm worried about you.
                                      71.


           ANDREW (O.S.)
Why?   Your life's great-

          MATT
Dude, don't be like that, okay-

          ANDREW (O.S.)
You don't need to worry about me.
I'm stronger than ever now. I can
lift a whole car by myself. I
could fucking crush this entire
house, I'm fine.

          MATT
That doesn't- that actually sounds
like the opposite of fine. Andrew,
come on, let's get out of here,
your room's a mess, it smells like
a Denny's bathroom in here.

             ANDREW (O.S.)
So what?

          MATT
You're my cousin. You're my friend-
it's my responsibility to take care
of you.

          ANDREW (O.S.)
I think you should go. I have to
pick up my mom's medication.

           MATT
...Are you going to break the
rules?
    (beat)
We're too strong now, Andrew.
We're too strong for that. If you
did that, you know I'd have to-

          ANDREW (O.S.)
You'd have to what. You were
always the weakest. You couldn't
do shit to me.

             MATT
...Andrew-

          ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm not gonna break your stupid
fucking rules, just fuck off and
stay out of my life.
                                                        72.


Matt stands staring at Andrew. The camera fidgets
uncomfortably. Matt shakes his head, and the camera follows
him as he goes to the window, gives Andrew one last look, and
then rockets off into the sky.

The camera sits in silence, pointed at the window.


INT. PHARMACY

The camera approaches the counter.

                     PHARMACIST
           Hello, how can I help you.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
           I'm here to pick up a prescription
           for Sandra Detmer.

                     PHARMACIST
           Um, yes, hold on. That's Imuran,
           Baclofen, Glatiramer and Vicodin.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
           That's right.

                     PHARMACIST
           Okay, and the copay on that
           is...Seven hundred and fifteen
           dollars, eighty three cents.

Silence.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
           I have to come back.
                     PHARMACIST
           Okay, we'll hold it for you.


INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - LATER

Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave.
His stereo plays David Bowie. Once his dad's car is gone,
Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the
mirror, and leaves the room.

Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate. He
opens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform. We
do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at
it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof
inner lining is exposed.

"Ziggy Stardust" comes on Andrew's stereo.
                                                        73.


Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror,
his back to the camera. He reaches down, and picks something
up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head.

It's a gas mask.

He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless
figure in the mirror. Looks right. Looks left. Adjusts the
mask.

Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly
yanked across the room.

EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SUNSET

It's a run-down house in Andrew's neighborhood. The
streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in
yellow orange haze.

Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the
porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt. They clearly
haven't noticed Andrew, who's filming from out by the street.

He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the
house. It flies up and breaks a window. Costly, Howard and
the thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing as
they rapidly surround Andrew.

He doesn't react.

                    HOWARD
          You are about to get fucking
          stomped, you know that right? You
          hear me son? Come to my house,
          it's late, I don't see any fucking
          police officers or some shit, I
          don't know what you you think
          you're doing throwing shit at my
          house-

                    COSTLY
          No, wait, what the fuck. What the
          fuck are you dressed up like that
          for. Are you high?

                    HOWARD
          Lil' Andrew's straight up tripping
          right now, I don't even know, I'ma
          give your ass a wake up call-

Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in front
of the camera. He makes the "gun sign."
                                                           74.


                    HOWARD (CONT'D)
          Oh you got a gat? I got a gat too
          bitch-

Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
              (firing the finger gun)
          Bang.

Howard's body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loud
chorus of cracks, and then is FLUNG ASIDE. The thugs,
shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrew
telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending him
smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car.

Costly and the remaining thug start running, and the
remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him,
breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before he's
propelled face first into the ground, WHAM.

Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front of
Costly, who skids to a halt.

                     COSTLY
          -no, no-

Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as
though under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving a
glistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he falls
across the curb.

We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but
other than that, the night is silent.

Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loose
money lift away from them, flying to him. There's a beat,
and then Andrew launches into the air.


EXT. RADIOTOWER - 80 FEET UP - TWILIGHT

Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on
one of the strut supports. The camera sits nearby, watching
the expressionless figure as it counts the money.

There's a beat and he hangs his head. We can hear muffled
noises of frustration from under the mask. Something that
sounds like a low, angry scream.

Very suddenly, he dives off the tower. A second later, the
camera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall.
                                                          75.


EXT. GAS STATION

Andrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gas
station. He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towards
it. We transition to...


FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS.

Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio.

We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure
in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front
of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station
store.


INT. GAS STATION

The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store.
Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, who
says something, looking concerned. He's suddenly blown out
of frame.
After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter,
and floats over to Andrew.

Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him;
as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling. He
goes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun.


EXT. GAS STATION

Andrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells,
raising the shotgun.
Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires as
he's hit by a wave of energy. The shotgun blast goes wild,
striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage.

The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire
envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look
through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.


FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.

The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audio
from its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING.

It's been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who lays
motionless, burning.
                                                       76.


The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer is
horribly injured and screaming. His gas pump lays on the
ground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt.

Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces
himself to roll over. The fire on his body touches the fire
on the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump.

The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station.

The camera is spun violently out into the street-

                                                  VIOLENT
                                           DISTORTION AND
                                          CRASH TO BLACK.


FROM SECURE ROOM VIDEO FEED


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

The camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat
distorted audio. The image is a little blown out.

Andrew on a bed. His entire right side is absolutely
scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper,
blackened and red. The parts of him that are bandaged are
already soaked through with blood.

He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines.
Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon. This is ensured
by the handcuff on his left wrist.

The machines beep. Andrew doesn't move. The door opens, and
Mr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the
other side of the door.

                    MR. DETMER
          -come down to the city, cause his
          mother's all alone right now.
          She's got MS, I had to leave her at
          the house all a fucking alone.

                    POLICE DETECTIVE
          I understand, Mr. Detmer.

                    MR. DETMER
          Shit. Jesus, look at this.   Can I
          have a moment with my son.

                    POLICE DETECTIVE
          Yeah I- I'll be outside the door,
          yeah?
                                                        77.


                      MR. DETMER
          Okay.

The officer closes the door, and Mr. Detmer goes and sits
down in a chair next to the bed. He sits there staring at
Andrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in
his hands. We SPEED UP THE RECORDING, and Detmer just sits
like that. After five minutes of speed up, we slow down.

                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
          I want you to apologize to me.

Andrew is comatose.

                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
          I said I want you to apologize to
          me. I know you can hear me. So I
          want you to sit up and apologize to
          me. I want you to stop this
          bullshit right now.

Andrew is comatose.

                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
          Do you know how much this shit is
          going to cost me? Do you know what
          you've done to your family?
              (beat)
          You don't even care, do you? You
          just don't give a fuck, you've got
          your fucking morphine, don't you.

There's a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrew's burnt
shoulder. Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on
the monitor.
                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
          Stop it. I'm not buying this shit,
          you can't just play this off like a
          fucking
              (slap)
          Game, this is real. You really
          fucked me, me and your mother you
          know that, you little
              (slap)
          Shit.
Andrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding
molten welts. Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a
quick pace forward and back.

                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
          Goddamn it, goddamn it!-
                                                           78.


Detmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrew's arm jerks up.
Mr. Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air.

He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes
rigid.

Andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates
into all of his component parts.
They stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground
in a bloody mess.

Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball
hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of
agony, and then another, tearing at his IV.

The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to
the gore that was Andrew's father. They barely have time to
scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and
lets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing apart
everything in the room including the camera.
                                              SMASH CUT TO:


FROM CASEY'S CAMERA.


INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

All of Casey's family is present, along with lots of little
kids. Everyone's gathered around Casey's little brother,
who's being presented with a birthday cake. Matt looks
happy.

                    EVERYONE
          -appy birthday to you!

Everyone let's out a cheer, including Casey, but then she
notices Matt abruptly duck out. She follows him to the
bathroom...

                                                      CUT.

...where he's holding his nose, which is bleeding badly.

                       CASEY
          Matt-

                     MATT
          Do you hear that, how can you not
          hear that?
                                                          79.


In the background, we can hear the house phone ring.    Then
cell phones.

                    CASEY
          Matt, what hap-

                    MATT
          The singing, how can you not hear
          that!? Something's wrong, okay,
          something's wrong with Andrew, or-

                    CASEY
          Matt, please, okay, you're scaring
          me, are you okay-

                    MATT
          No, something's wrong, something's
          wrong.

Matt pushes past her, running upstairs. Casey starts to
follow, but then stops, lowering the camera.

                    CASEY'S MOM (O.S.)
          Casey, you have to come in here.

                    CASEY
          Mom, Matt is-

                    CASEY'S MOM
          Come in here right now.   Come in
          here right now.

                                                        CUT.

Casey's filming the big screen TV, which is showing the news.
                     REPORTER
          -going to have a feed live on the
          scene in the second, we apologize
          for the delay but as of right now
          every news helicopter in the
          greater Multnomah County is headed
          to Portland- again, right now we
          have very little information, but
          the word is that the bombings
          started just over nine minutes ago,
          and haven't subsided yet, with-
          okay, here's the feed from NBC
          Chopper 5.

We get a helicopter view from over downtown Portland,
everything seems okay, and then something streaks by,
crashing headlong into the side of a building.
                                                        80.


The impact is like a wrecking ball, office furniture blowing
out into the air along with glass, steel and concrete, WHAM.

                    FIELD REPORTER (O.S.)
          Wait, that was- that was not a bomb-
          I repeat, not bombings, it's
          something else-

The camera turns as Matt rushes down the stairs, now in his
winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex. We hear another
of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes
back to the TV, revealing the big MADE IN OREGON sign in Old
Town toppling down into the street.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          I need your car.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          What? Matt, look, what's
          happening, look at what's happening-

                    MATT
          I see, I know, I have to go, okay-

                    CASEY (V.O.)
          Don't leave, don't leave me-

                    MATT
          Give me your keys.

                     CASEY (O.S.)
          I- Matt-


EXT. CASEY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Casey is chasing Matt across the lawn to her car, her voice
filling with panic, the camera being held offhanded now,
unimportant.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          Please don't leave, don't go-

We hear helicopters pass low overhead.

                    MATT
          I have to go to the city.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          NO MATT PLEASE, PLEASE-
                                                         81.


                    MATT
          I can't fly if there are all these
          helicopters in the air, I just have
          to drive there, or, listen, I have
          to figure this out, Andrew's in
          trouble. This is my fault.

                     CASEY (O.S.)
          Andrew?   What are you talking ab-

Matt gets in the car and starts it.   Casey's breaking down,
openly crying now.

                    CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Matt please! MATT PLEASE, PLEASE
          DON'T GO, I'M AFRAID! MATT I'M
          SCARED, PLEASE!


INT. CASEY'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Casey's sitting shotgun as Matt drives. His face is
unreadable. They're driving on the I-5. More helicopters.
Downtown Portland is visible now, as are some fires.

Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap.

                    MATT
          This is all my fault.

                   CASEY
          No! No it isn't!   It isn't your
          fault!

We hear and see the lights of ambulances and police cars as
they zoom past, but Casey keeps the camera on Matt.
                    CASEY (CONT'D)
          Matt, it's not safe. It's not
          safe. What's going on. What's
          happening. Why are we doing this,
          Matt, please. Please take me home.
          You don't have your license, you
          can't drive without your license.

                                                      CUT.

They're getting into downtown now. We can hear sirens.
Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal,
until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to
reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed
on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.
                                                         82.


                    CASEY (CONT'D)
          How- how is that possible, that's
          not possible-

There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains
down onto the car. Matt slams on the brakes, looking up
through the windshield, searching the sky.

                    MATT
          Where are you, man?

There's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on
the passenger's side, next to Casey.

                    POLICE OFFICER
          Listen, you can't be here, I need
          you to turn this car around right
          now and-

The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight
for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away.
Casey screams.

                    CASEY
          What's...What is...What's...Matt
          please, please-

The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flipping
end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes
to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet. Casey's
breathing is painfully short and sharp. Matt stares out into
the night sky.

He flicks on the brights. There's Andrew, in his hospital
gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and
twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.
A news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a
moment, Andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight.

His eyes flash to the car.

                    ANDREW
              (screaming)
          WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?
The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED
OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his
seatbelt with him.
                     CASEY
          No NO NO
                                                         83.


The car goes into freefall, no longer important to Andrew,
plummeting down, down, down. Casey's screams are barely
audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush
past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to
her death.

And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting,
the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred
views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...

Stillness. Casey's camera is pointed down, showing her
adidas...and Matt's high-tops.

                    MATT (O.S.)
          Stay here, okay? You have to stay
          here.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
              (barely coherent)
          You can fly?

                       MATT (O.S.)
          Stay here.     I have to talk to
          Andrew.

                    CASEY (O.S.)
          Matt..what...

                    MATT (O.S.)
          Casey, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

Matt's feet suddenly go out of frame.

                       CASEY (O.S.)
          Matt wait!     WAIT PLEASE!   MATT!
NOTE: In the following sequence, everything is seen in
glimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing.
Much of what happens should be seen through implication,
rather than direct effect.

Everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras can
fully keep track.


FROM SEVERAL HELICAMS.

The feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio,
meaning no narration from the reporter. There are several
chopper's flying at different distances from the action, and
we intercut as necessary.
                                                        84.


EXT. DOWNTOWN PORTLAND

The news chopper at first shows Casey's destroyed car laying
in the street, then pans back up to show Andrew, who's
floating hunched over, vomiting.

Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew
shoves him away. We're too far away to hear anything that's
said.

Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something. Matt, clearly
upset, replies. Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures
towards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but
Andrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the
destruction, and says something gently.

Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a
radical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerned;
he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at
Matt.

Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents.
Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something
to his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING HIM
LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.
Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper;
a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.


FROM MICHAEL ERNESTO'S CAMERA.

MICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from his
building, out on his roof. He watches in horror as the
helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of
frame.
Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.

                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
          Oh, oh no, those people, man, those
          people, oh god-

                    ERNESTO'S NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
          Where's the other guy?

                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
          He's fucking dead man, you saw- oh
          shit oh shit-

Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded
bird, crashing into the roof. He vomits again, mostly bile;
everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in
pain and rolls over.
                                                        85.


He's bleeding badly from the nose and ears.

                    ANDREW
              (agonized, crying)
          No one's gonna help me...No one's
          gonna help me now...

We get some shots from other people's cameras, video phones,
etc on the roof. Some people scream and try to run past
Andrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins,
which leads to more screaming.

Andrew stands shakily, looking directly at Michael Ernesto.

                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
          Please man, please, I don't know
          you man-

                    ANDREW
              (mumbled)
          What type of camera is that?

                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
              (breaking down)
          What? I don't know, I don't know
          you man, I didn't- please okay,
          please-

Andrew starts to raise an arm, when he's suddenly NAILED BY
MATT, blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour.

FROM BANK SECURITY CAMERA.

The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when MATT AND
ANDREW COME CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF.

FROM POLICE CAR DASHBOARD CAM.

The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to a
halt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT OF
THE BANK.
The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's not
impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guys
fighting for their lives. Matt gets the upperhand, decking
Andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop
car (our POV), lifts off.

WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns
and creates a telekinetic wall.
                                                        86.


FROM CALA PRENTI'S CAMERA.

CALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and
horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent
FLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes her
window, lights still flaring.

Her sister rushes up, looking out the window.

                    CALA (O.S.)
          Sissy stay away from the window!

                    SISSY
          What's happening what's happening-

                    CALA (O.S.)
          They're right out there fighting!
          They're-

Andrew and Matt come BLASTING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IN THE
KITCHEN OFF TO THE RIGHT, AND THEN OUT THROUGH THE CEILING.

FROM KPR-PORTLAND'S HELICAM.

The two boys come smashing up through the roof of the
apartment building. Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase.
Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at
street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees,
etc...
...But Matt's too good a flyer. What he doesn't block he
simply dips and weaves around. Andrew, clearly still woozy,
is distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out on
the asphalt.
                    CAMERA-MAN
          They're down. One of them just
          went down. Jesus christ.

Matt slowly lands nearby. The camera zooms in and hits them
both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and
look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.

We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matt's
face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth
and ears. He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly
covered with injuries. He looks like he's been in a car
wreck.

                    CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)
          Oh shit, look at him.
                                                         87.


He approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently. Andrew
just shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to
stand, like a wounded dog.

Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading
and taking cover. One of them advances on Matt and Andrew,
gun raised. Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective,
pleading, raising his hands.

The cop is clearly panicked. He fires a shot.    Matt's arm
whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain,
holding his hand, which is gushing blood.

                                            Andrew blasts the
Matt falls, screaming, and Andrew stands.
officers backwards.
                     CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)
          OH SHIT!   Oh jesus christ!

Andrew approaches Matt, screaming and looking absolutely
terrifying. Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew
following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.


FROM KPR-PORTLAND'S LIVE-ON-THE-SCENE.

We're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely
everywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared
and looking for answers. A FIELD REPORTER fixes herself,
preparing to speak.

                    FIELD REPORTER
          Are we...Okay, yeah, gimme- two,
          one- We're live on the scene on
          Parson Boulevard just south of the
          center of downtown, and-
There's a rushing, screeching sound from around the corner.
The camera jerks, and moves towards the corner, the cameraman
man running to see what the sound is.

                    FIELD REPORTER (CONT'D)
          Shawn, wait, you're unplugged.
          Shawn-

Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying
past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging
at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man,
SLAMMING HIM INTO THE SIDE OF A SKYSCRAPER ON THE STREET.
Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against
buildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a
pinball until-
                                                           88.


FROM ABC 5'S HELICAM.

-Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a
massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing
downwards as though shot out of a cannon.
They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," a
trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves
building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to
the ground.

Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops
down at a broken, dead angle. Andrew lands nearly as badly,
lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and
screaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him.


FROM MICHAEL GRAVES' BUILDING EXTERIOR SECURITY CAMERA

The statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street.
Andrew writhes. Matt is motionless, blood pooling around
him, his back broken.


FROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS, HELICOPTER CAMERAS, HANDHELDS
FROM WINDOWS, EVERYTHING.

A bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the
front of the Michael Graves building and downed statue. Matt
and Andrew's bodies are painted by spotlights as police and
news helicopters hang overhead.

Police unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a
perimeter and pushing in. We're with them as they approach;
the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting
back and forth to each other.
Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots.

Andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the
bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and
he shakily raises both hands.

The all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are
telekinetically lifted into the air.

They hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their
limbs go rigid. We've seen this before.

Andrew screams, and then...It all happens in under two
seconds:
                                                         89.


Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of
Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard,
first through Andrew, then into the pavement.

Andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then
Matt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out,
striking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly.

All of the floating people drop, dazed.

Matt collapses.   After a moment, the police advance.

                                              CUT TO BLACK.


FROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS.

The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear,
with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the
top and bottom of the screens.

Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room. At the far
end is a blackened out two way mirror. There's a camera on
the inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits
reflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable
expressions.

There is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out of
the chair. It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of
the Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical
attention.

To this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things,
massive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes
and cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back.
He can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own
blood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the
cameras.

He is barely coherent, screeching in agony.

                    MATT
          Please...Help me. Help me, HELP ME,
          please...I'm sorry! I'm so sorry,
          I tried- help me, help me, I'm
          dying, I'm dying. Stars- I see
          stars, somebody- It hurts, please.
          I'm- the blood...I tried...

Two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some
kind of radiation sensors. They go over to Matt, scanning
him.
                                                          90.


                    MATT (CONT'D)
          Listen, help me, help me. I'm
          dying, you have to help me, don't
          just let me- PLEASE I'M SORRY! I'm
          SORRY! HELP ME! I-

The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, his
eyes going wide.

                    MATT (CONT'D)
          I can...I can hear the singing.

Matt entirely stops moving.   He lays there, not breathing,
completely still.

And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the
table and the chair. There are a series of grotesque popping
and snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and
writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.

The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we
realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.
His broken bones have already molded back into place. His
bruises are shrinking away to nothing.

The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its
frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking
military personnel, along with several men in civilian
clothes.

Matt stares at them.   They stare back at him.

                    4-STAR GENERAL
              (terrified)
          Listen...Son, you don't- I mean...
Matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off.
Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.

                    MATT
          Would you please...turn off the
          fucking cameras.
                                               CUT TO BLACK.

                                               HOLD ON BLACK
                                               FOR A MOMENT.

FROM INTERNATIONAL NEWS BROADCASTS.

We see a variety of international reporters covering a
breaking story, but only see little clips of each, in
multiple languages. Behind them are various shots of a huge
hydroelectric dam in South Korea.

                    REPORTERS
          -expected to burst at any moment-
          City officials blame the
          malfunctions on the terrorist
          bombing that occurred at the dam's
          control center last March.-
          Botched evacuation has left
          thousands of the Kyo-lee Valley's
          residents trapped, with only one
          major roadway leading in or out. A
          roadway that has not been repaired
          in over ten years- Again, the scale
          here is just unprecedented. Our
          hearts are with people of Kyo-Lee
          tonight.


FROM KIM HAI-SU'S CAMERA.


INT. KIM HAI-SU'S HOUSE

Kim Hai-Su, 17, is behind the camera filming his father, 40s,
as his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle.
Kim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room,
crying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down
the camera.

                                                     CUT.
They're in the car, driving fast through town. All around we
can see people panicking, and we see two cars collide on the
road up ahead.

                                                     CUT.

They pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped
into gridlocked, dead-end traffic. Kim Hai-Su's father
begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which
triggers his younger brother crying again. Kim shouts to
calm down.

                                                     CUT.

Kim is climbing out of the car; people all around are getting
out of their cars, hopelessly trapped. Someone screams, and
Kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away.
                                                        92.


Rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack, which
splits further. Kim yells in fear. The crack widens, an
enormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down the
side of the hills into the valley.
Kim's father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange,
when suddenly there's the sound of a sonic boom overhead.

All around them people EXPLODE into cheers. It's not fear,
but rather a kind of frantic ovation. The camera sweeps up,
panning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to rest
on

Matt Garrety.

Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway. He
pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!" This gets the
intended response, and he pumps a fist shouting "FUCK YEAH
KOREA!"

He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the
first time, mouths "Oh shit!" Points at the flood casually
as it closes in: "I should deal with this." Another huge
ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!"
and turns.

There's a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less
than a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearing
into the distance over the flood.

After a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to
stop, slowing and freezing in place, and then...SLOWLY BEGINS
TO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM.
The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane,
embracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars. Kim's
father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car, and
Kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his
lungs.

The camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going
positively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and
down, screaming, smiling...

An unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to
rise, rise, singing and we-

          FADE UP ON:
          SPACE. Infinite stars. A TITLE:

          1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY.
          We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within.
          Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON...

          A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS
          Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses --
          a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND...
          A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more
          beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO --
          A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the
          baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes.
          But.
          The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF
          LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET:
          FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!

          THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND
          HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts
          to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR --
          Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some
          superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we
          WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS --
          And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE

          DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING

          FLEEING PEOPLE.
          Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap
          open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE --
          faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND.
          THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her
          baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read:
          C--() ... .-4ï¿½_ s A N D A

          EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

          burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN.
          Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD.
          We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a
          MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet.
          COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where
          the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...
          .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve
          this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist:
          A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the
          surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
          And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to
          shield his eyes... but STOFS:
          A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young,
          beautiful. SMILING.
          The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat?
          The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches
          toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.

          THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE:
          THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough.
          Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          Howdy.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          We're riding towards Absolution. You
          know how far west we are?
          The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          Maybe he's a dummy.
          Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          There a reason you don't wanna answer my
          question, friend?
          And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --

                         MOSE CLAIBORNE
          Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and
          he's been shot.

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          Bet he's a chain jumper.
          Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         LUKE
          If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
          Let's bring him with us.
          Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
          scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --

                         WES CLAIBORNE
          Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn
          round and start walking.
          But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
          steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --

          WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)
          Dead or alive, no difference. I said

                         WALK OR--
          THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle
          forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE
          MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
          As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again --
          SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
          Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
          his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:

                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
          -- P-please, God -- d-don't --
          -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY.
          Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down,
          knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
          This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't
          seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at
          his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.
          The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES
          on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks
          it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --

          "TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY

          OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP

          -- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP"

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (a hoarse whisper)
          Absolution...

          SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER:
          With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the
          third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off...
          sees the dog following...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
          Get outta here. Leave me alone.
          But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man
          turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
          VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is:

          EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY

          A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten.
          Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in --
          dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.
          His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man
          looks at the dog and says --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Stay.
          The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's
          moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
          uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound --
          then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
          Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:

                         MEACHAM
          Palms to heaven, Friend.
          The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Been shot.

                         MEACHAM
          Only two kinds of men get shot --
          criminals and victims.
          (steps forward; hard)
          Which one're you?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          don't know.
          Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when
          he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...

                         MEACHAM
          Got a name, son?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Don't know that either.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         MEACHAM
          What do you know?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (a beat; then)
          ... English.
          Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO:

          INT. CHURCH RECTORY - LATER

          A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and
          Meacham's studying The Man's wound:

                         MEACHAM
          Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.
          (off The Man's look)
          Means somethin' burned it half closed.
          The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
          over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
          twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the
          strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet?
          The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?"
          Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Try'n hold still.
          He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
          slightly, but bears the pain.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Where'd you ride in from?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          West. Woke up in the desert.
          Looking up at the sun like I'd been
          dropped outta the sky.

                         MEACHAM
          Seems I remember a story about that
          happening once... fella by the name of
          Lucifer.

                         (GRINS)
          How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for
          short.
          But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror:
          his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          That blood yours or somebody else's?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Three men rode up. Drew on me.

                         (STILL CONFUSED)
          My hands... moved on their own.

                         MEACHAM

                         (A BEAT)
          Anything else you wanna confess to while
          you got my attention?
          And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Everything that happened before I woke
          up...
          (shakes his head)
          It's gone.

                         MEACHAM
          Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for
          your sins if you don't recall 'em. That
          bein' said...
          Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n'
          brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          I seen bad men do good things and good
          men do bad things. Whether you end up in
          heaven or hell... it's not God's plan...
          it's yours.

                         (BEAT)
          You just got to remember what it was.
          The Man considers. Darkly --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          What if I don't want to remember?

                         MEACHAM

                         (BEAT; GRINS)
          Then you're probl'y goin' to hell.
          On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a
          MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around
          the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the
          confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men!
          WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside! The Man whirls to see
          A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Their leader is PERCY DOLARHYDE, a cocky, hot-tempered bastard --
          he ignites another Molotov, hurls it at the CLAIMS OFFICE --

                         PERCY

          THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER! ONLY

          CLAIM TO LAND AROUND HERE'S THE ONE WITH
          HiS NAME ON IT!
          The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING -- Percy cocks another
          Molotov, aiming for the SALOON --
          But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Percy! N2t the saloon!

                         PERCY
          Why the goddamn hell not?!

                         NAT COLORADO
          Cause your dady said so.
          Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES
          -- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS
          OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:

          INT. MEACHAN'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple
          blankets as he moves past The Man --

                         MEACHAM
          You wanna help or are you just gonna
          stand there and burn?!

          EXT. CHURCH - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

          FRIGHTENED TOWNSPEOPLE run for the sanctuary of the church,
          Meacham SWATS OUT the fire on the steps --

                         MEACHAM
          All right, folks -- don't panic! Get
          inside and you'll be fine... C'mon...
          Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the
          street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Put it out before it gets goin'!
          ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire
          brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to --

          THE GENERAL STORE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          WHIPS open the blanket, beats at the flames advancing toward the
          roof -- PUTS THE FIRE OUT as the door FLIES OPEN and out steps:
          A KID. 11. Rough n' tumble. And right now, mouth full of
           LICORICE. Two FULL JARS of CANDY in his hands. OOPS:

                         KID
          Just tryin' to save the candy.
          (SWALLOWS, worried now)
          You one of my Pa's hired guns?
          Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY.
          He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man --

                         PERCY
          Who the hell're yam?
          Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:

                         THE MAN
          Nobody.

                         PERCY
          Nobody is right. You think you can just
          collect your fifty dollars and ride off?
          You signed up for the wrong side, boy.
          The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          Tell you what. You get down on your
          knees and kiss my boot.
          The Man's eyes narrow --

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          You do that and I'll let you run back to

          Absolution belongs -tg..th-e- 1Dolar es.

                         THE MAN
          You want me to kiss your boot?
          Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:

                         PERCY
          Tongue's just fine if you're feelin'
          amorous. Don't hold ba --
          THWIP! The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick
          move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE!
          Percy FLIES off the HORSE -- The Man grabbing his rifle -- the
          moment Percy lands, it's STICKING into his NECK:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         THE MAN
          Kiss this, you sonofa --

          NAT COLORADO (O.S.)

          -- PUT IT DOWN !
          -- Nat Colorado gallops around the corner, SHOTGUN RAISED.

                         PERCY
          Goddamnit, Nat -- SHOOT HIM!!!
          -- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a
          SHIELD between himself and Colorado. Eerily calm --

                         THE MAN
          Wherever you came from? Go back.
          Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL. MORE GANG
          MEMBERS ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:

                         GREAVEY
          Sheriff's right behind us, Nat!

                         PERCY
          You goddamned shitheels! Don't you even
          THINK about leavin' me!!!!
          Colorado -- DECISION -- doesn't take long -- glares at The Man --

                         NAT COLORADO
          Be seeing you.

                         THE MAN
          Look forward to it.
          With that, Nat spurs his horse -- YA! The others follow him as
          he RIDES HARD out of town. Percy growls at The Man --

                         PERCY
          You are a dead man. You hear me? So
          help me God I will kill you my--
          DM! The Man's SMASHES Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him
          OUT COLD, as LAWMEN approach on horseback --

                         KID
          FA! He caught Percy Dolarhyde!
          SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse. Tall, dark and
          handsome despite a SADNESS in his eyes, already dismounting:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Emmett -- you all right?
          The Kid (now EMMETT) strides towards his father excitedly:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          a-f lap jack- then-stared-down-Nat-Colorado-
          like-he-wasn't-even-scared!!!!
          Taggart turns to The Man now, cautious, but grateful --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Pardon my boy, mister. He can be
          excitable.
          (puts out his hand)
          Kyle Taggart.
          The Man shakes Taggart's hand. A beat. Then --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          . Luke.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of
          fifty dollars, actually.
          (off The Man's look)
          Our advert? The telegram?
          The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT.

           SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Could use a man like you in case any of
          'em come back...

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          -- I'm just passing through.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Fair enough. You don't mind spending the
          night, bank opens in the morning... I'll
          get you your money then.
          (nods down the street)
          Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria
          I sent you.
          The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still STARSTRUCK), turns
          to go. Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          You here with the prospector woman?
          The Man stops. Intrigued. Turns back --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          woman?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yup. Real looker. Came into town
          yesterday with that there dog. She a
          friend of yours?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          ON THE MAN. His first real LEAD.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Maybe.
          And as The Man heads off, we HOLD ON TAGGART, his spidey-sense
          tingling that all is not RIGHT with this...

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Somethin' wrong, Kyle?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's that French sayin' where you swear
          you seen someone before?

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Don't speak French.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          No... you sure's hell don't.
          Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we CUT TO:

          EXT. CATTLE RANGE - MAGIC HOUR

          300 head of CATTLE under a blood red sky -- BOOM DOWN to THREE
          RANCH HANDS by a fire. One's drinking liberally from a BOTTLE;
          call him ROY CLANTON. The other two trade glances, nervous:

                         RANCH HAND #1
          Should take it easy there, Pal --

                         RANCH HAND #2
          Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink
          on the job.

                         ROY CLANTON
          I don't give a damn what he don't like --
          gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of
          cattle. Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat.
          (rises; grabs his

                         CROTCH)
          Gotta see a man about a buffalo...
          He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More
          THUNDER. Something doesn't feel right. A sudden WHOOSH and --

          A COW'S PULLED INTO THE AIR BEHIND THEM BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE,
          JUST LIKE THE APACHES IN OUR OPENING! Flies STRAIGHT UP, out of
          FRAME. Its PLAINTIVE MOO blending into all the others:

                         RANCH HAND #1
          You hear that?

                         RANCH HAND #2
          Hear what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          ANOTHER COW zips up from the herd behind them. And ANOTHER.
          MANY OF THE SWSSHS. The men slowly turn toward the sound as --

          ALL AT ONCE, HUNDREDS OF COWS FLY OFF INTO THE SKY!

                         RANCH HAND #1

          SWEET JESUS!!!

          THE DARKNESS EXPLODES WITH EERILY BRILLIANT BLUE LIGHT! THE MEN

          SCREAM AS THEY'RE ENGULFED IN IT AND --
          ROY CLANTON -- comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his
          pants as the light DISAPPEARS -- to find the men GONE. So are
          the COWS. PULL BACK... he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range.

          INT. GOLD LEAF SALOON - NIGHT

          THE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the
          dog, tips his hat to a couple WHORES. They GRIN, liking what
          they see. RANCH HANDS drink their pay. Behind the bar, a MAN
          and WOMAN argue. DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty;
          he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY:

                         DOC
          -- I know you are, don't lie to me!

                         MARIA
          How many times do we have to do this,
          Arturo? J. love you.

                         DOC
          Really? Do you?!?
          (holds up a POCKETWATCH)
          I found this in our bed! And I don't
          k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a
          watch because y insisted we buy this
          saloon!
          She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The
          Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this:

                         MARIA
          We have customers.
          And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the
          back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses:

                         DOC

          AFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!!
          Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS.
          The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate:

                         ATTICUS
          That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll
          drill him down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         MARIA
          Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who
          took out Percy Dolarhyde.
          Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before
          sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria
          rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          I'm looking for a woman.
          She gestures to the WHORES --

                          MARIA
          What kind?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          This kind.
          He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN.

                         MARIA
          Never seen her before. But she is
          beautiful.
          (pours him whiskey; then
          one for herself)
          Here's to you finding her, Senor.
          ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK
          glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another:

                         MARIA (CONT'D)
          You have any idea what kind of mess you
          just stepped into?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          No. But I figured I'd be safe in here
          seein' as how that boy I tossed off his
          horse didn't wanna burn your saloon.
          Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then:

                          - -

                         MARIA
          It's not the boy you should worry about.

                         (OMINOUS)
          It's his papa.

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          POV: UPSIDE DOWN, A MAN, surrounded by his RANCH HANDS -- his
          FACE just out of the light, hat brim lowered under an oil lamp:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you
          might call, the Tall Hog at the trough.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          His face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather
          Wellington boots that bespeak wealth. HARD. Exudes POWER:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been
          working for me two weeks now, and I
          haven't had the pleasure.
          Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow
          abductions. TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES
          OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE:

                         CLANTON
          Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't

                         STEAL YOUR--
          -- a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses --
          STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the
          horses skittish.

                         (THEN)
          You partial to history? Here's a primer,

                         LISTEN CLOSE:
          He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE.
          Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Following the War Of Northern Aggression
          -- what some ironically refer to as the
          "Civil" War -- came a prodigious nation-
          wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up
          all along these prairies, Roy; populated
          by enterprising young drovers -- among
          'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold
          six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted
          to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the
          scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then
          turned 'em into the fattest herd West of
          the Chisholm Trail.
          (stops: the WHIP)
          Watched him work this lash, driving those
          steer til his fingers bled... but what
          good's a whip without a herd, Roy?
          And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt...

                         ROY CLANTON
          Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me
          -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a
          light in the sky -- blue -- and when I
          ran back the cows and fellas were gone!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         DOLARHYDE
          The sky. Opened up. And took my cows.
          Incoming HOOFBEATS -- Dolarhyde looks up to see COLORADO and the
          rest of the GANG returning from Absolution.
          A WOMAN emerges from the servant's quarters. APACHE. 50's.
          Beautiful. As the men REAR, Nat Colorado MEETS EYES with her.
          A relationship we don't understand yet as Dolar strides up --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Where's Percy?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Jail. Sheriff locked him up.
          Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy:

                         DOLARHYDE
          When're these people gonna lgarn?
          He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's
          FEET. His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH:

                         ROY CLANTON

                         THANK Y--
          Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is
          tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to
          kill.
          As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman.
          Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED.

                         NAT COLORADO
          Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It
          was a stranger.
          That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark:

                         DOLARHYDE
          ... What stranger?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Usually a man gives off a scent. Where
          he's been. What he's done.

                         (STILL SPOOKED)
          He didn't have one.

          OFF DOLARHYDE, EYES BURNING --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          INT. SHERIFF TAGGART'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          A BULLET, in close up, twirling between the thumb and forefinger
          of SHERIFF TAGGART. Boots up on his desk, TROUBLED.
          Deputy Wade pours himself a cup from a TIN POT OF COFFEE:

          DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE
          Percy wouldn't've come in shooting
          without his daddy's say-so, Kyle. You
          best get ready for a war 'cause that's
          what's comin'.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Tomorrow we ride the little shit up
          Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's
          got a beef, he can take it up with the
          6th cavalry.
          Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door --

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Goddamn tired of this... fatass rancher
          scaring good people off their lan--
          He STOPS. Something catches his eye on the posting board.
          YANKS a piece of paper off, a mixture of CONFUSION and CONCERN

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Sonofabitch.
          WHAT DOES HE SEE? Before we get a chance to KNOW --

          EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

          EMMETT'S FACE rises into frame, peering into the saloon from
          below a windowsill. Sees THE MAN IN BLACK at the bar as ---

          INT. SALOON - NIGHT

          -- he SLUGS back a shot, the dog at his feet, still eyeing that
          steak on Atticus' plate. The Man points to his GLASS:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Another.

                         MARIA
          You drink like a man who wants to forget.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (haunted; the irony)
          Other way round.
          The dog WHINES AGAIN for the steak. Atticus SLAMS down his
          silverware. Draws his GUN --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         ATTICUS
          You got three seconds to get your dog
          outta here or I blow his balls off.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (without a blink)
          Not my dog.

                         ATTICUS
          Q=... two...
          -- and just before "three"... CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES,
          because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Give you odds you don't get to 'three.'
          RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN.
          Beautiful. EXOTIC. Dressed in leather. Meet ELLA SWENSON.
          ON THE MAN IN BLACK. Can't help himself. immediate and
          undeniable CHEMISTRY. But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST
          sound and the dog snaps to her side. Atticus uncocks his gun,
          slowly slides it back in the holster --

                         ATTICUS
          I was just havin' some fun, Miss --

                         ELLA
          Give- him, the steak.
          Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE
          GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him -- and his plate -- to
          the floor. Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Now say you're sorry.

                         ATTICUS
          (biting his tongue)
          I'm-- sorry.

                         ELLA
          His name's 'Happy.'
          HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face

                         ATTICUS
          I'm sorry... 'Happy.'

                         ELLA
          Alright then.
          (lowers her rifle)
          You're right. That was fun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          -- Atticus scrambles back to his feet and OUT the door, as Ella
          looks at the Man In Black:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          What're you doing with my dog?

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          I was hoping you could tell me.

                         ELLA
          The hell're you talking ab--?
          WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Where... did you get that?
          Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY
          WADE (carrying a SHOTGUN), and 5 other deputies. They move
          cautiously to THE MAN, like he's a powder keg about to go off...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Hey there, "Luke." Mind following me
          down to the office so we can have us a
          chat...?

          THE MAN IN BLACK

                         (CONFUSED; ALERT)
          What for?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          All due respect, I'm the law, mister.
          That's what for.
          The men LOCK EYES:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Tell you what, Sheriff. How about you
          keep the fifty dollars you owe me and I
          just walk outta here like we. never met?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Because we did meet.
          ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man
          leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by
          holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL:

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          L can't be accountable for what happens
          if they draw on me.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          And what's gonna happen?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          Best you don't find out.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Now why'd you have to go and say that?
          Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE --

          THE MAN IN BLACK
          (low; genuine plea)
          Don't.
          But Charlie makes a MOVE and The Man SLAMS his head into a pole
          -- the NEXT GUNMAN reaches for his pistol -- The Man PUNCHES his
          THROAT -- SLAMS the third into a bench -- The FOURTH straight
          down on the Faro table --
          TAGGART levels his REPEATER -- but The Man just GRABS the barrel
          as Taggart FIRES a ROUND into the ceiling -- now the rifle's in
          THE MAN'S HANDS and just before he PULLS THE TRIGGER on Taggart:
          HE SEES EMMETT AT THE WINDOW. About to watch his father's
          MURDER... and The Man LOWERS the gun:

          THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
          I told you, I don't wanna hurt anyb--
          CRACK! The butt of a PISTOL WHIPS the side of his SKULL! The
          Man DROPS as we REVEAL who just knocked his ass OUT:
          ELLA! Taggart draws a gun and pins The Man, whipping out that
          piece of paper he pulled from his office...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yup -- looks just like him.

          NOW WE IT'S A WANTED POSTER WITH THE MAN'S FACE ON IT:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          "Jake Lonergan. Scourge a' The
          Territories. Wanted Dead or Alive."
          And The Man... now forever known as JAKE... stares WOOZILY into
          his OVERTURNED HAT... the photo tucked inside of the BEAUTIFUL
          WOMAN... her image goes BLURRY... then mil{:

                         AND WHAM:

          MEMORY FLASHCUTS1 STROBELIXE IMAGES --
          1.) A tilted, handmade trail sign: "SAGUARO PASS."
          2.) We're in a CABIN somewhere. BLINDING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT
          EXPLODES INTO THE CABIN, against which a DEMONIC SILHOUETTE
          appears -- it looks like an INDIAN IN FULL-FEATHER HEADDRESS --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          3.) A WOMAN'S FACE -- THE WOMAN FROM JAKE'S PHOTOGRAPH -- she
          looks at us and SCREAMS --
          4.) Now we're someplace VERY DARK -- a cave? As some kind of
          TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes --
          5.) Now we're RUNNING through the cave -- ESCAPE -- BREATHING
          HARD -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us
          as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:
          6.) A STRANGE ROCK FORMATION on the rim of a canyon -- like a
          STONE TOWER pointing to heaven as the SUN WHITEWASHES US TO:

          INT. JAIL CELL - PRE-DAWN

          JAKE'S EYES OPEN and he GASPS AIR! His POV: a FACE comes into
          FOCUS -- PERCY DOLARHYDE. GRINNING at him from the next cell:

                         PERCY
          You're a dead.
          Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality.

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          My daddy's comin' for me, Boy. You're
          gonna end up another dead shitheel under
          his spurs. I am gonna watch you suffer
          for a long, long --
          Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars,
          GRABBING PERCY'S COLLAR, YANKING FORWARDS -- SLAMMING Percy's
          head into the bars, KNOCKING hIM OUT COLD AGAIN. Percy DROPS.

                         JAKE
          Shut up.
          Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head.

          EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - JAIL - CONTINUOUS

          A PRISON WAGON pulls up in front of the Sheriff's office, along
          with Taggart's GUNMEN on horseback. ELLA takes frame as the men
          dismount and head into the office -- she pursues DEPUTY WADE
          with a real sense of PURPOSE:

                         ELLA
          I need to see Lonergan. It's important.

                         DEPUTY WADE
          'Fraid not, Miss -- we're preppin' him
          for transport.
          And pushes PAST her, into the office with the men. HOLD on Ella
          -- dammit, she NEEDS to find a way in there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS

          A KEY in the LOCK as the cell door OPENS: Sheriff Taggart, Wade,
          the gunmen. GLARING at Jake, then noticing Percy --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What happened to him?

                         JAKE

                         (DEADPAN)
          Man walked into a bar.
          Taggart shakes his head as Charlie and a deputy unlock Percy's
          cell, CUFF HIM, drag him out. Taggart points to Jake:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Step back against the wall there. Move
          and I shoot you dead.

                         JAKE
          (as he does)
          You should've let me go.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Yeah, I should've shot you in your knee.
          You put down six of my deputies.

                         JAKE
          Six was all you had.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Hell, they're gonna love you in Phoenix.

                         JAKE
          Yeah? What's in Phoenix?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What you got comin', Jake Lonergan.
          Taggart reaches into his shirt, pulls out a pair of GLASSES.
          Slips them on his nose. Takes out that WANTED poster and reads:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Aggravated banditry, 17 counts, Forgery,
          Blackmail, Hijacking, injurious use of a
          cattle prod, Arson, Incitement of
          Whorehouse Riot, and Trespassing with
          intent to deflower. You're also leader
          of a gang of outlaws includin' Creek
          Johnson and Bull McCade, which makes you
          accessory to every law they broke too.

                         JAKE
          (after a long BEAT:)
          That it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Saved the best for last... 'Murder.'
          That LANDS on Jake. Wondering if this is TRUE. Evenly --

                         JAKE
          It say who I killed?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Prostitute outta Mojave, name of Alice
          Wills.
          Taggart rises, removes Jake's BLACK STETSON from a hook on the
          wall, pulls that PHOTOGRAPH OF THE WOMAN from the inner brim:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          If I were a bettin' man, I'd say this
          would be Ms. Wills, would it not?
          Jake just stares, CONFUSED. SHAKEN.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          They found her dead in a cabin round
          Saguaro Pass, twenty miles west of here.
          With that, a CLUE falls into place: SAGUARO PASS.

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Deed was in your name.
          He slips the photo back in the brim, tosses the hat to Jake:

          SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
          Dead hooker with a hole in her chest, in
          your cabin, plus your sterling reputation
          equals guilty as goddamned sin.
          (draws his GUN)
          And you're gonna hang for it.
          At gunpoint, Taggart PUSHES Jake out the door --

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - DAWN

          Against the RISING SUN, Dolarhyde and 15 GUNMEN ride hard, armed
          to the teems. They REAR in the hills above Absolution. Dolar
          looks down through BINOCULARS as NAT COLORADO turns to...
          an incoming WIND. Across the valley, a massive BLACK CLOUD
          is starting to SWIRL. Violent BLUE FLASHES within. Eerie.

                         GREAVEY
          blue light... Clanton said he saw
          blue light before the cows disappeared...

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just a storm.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         COLORADO
          No storm I've ever seen... I say we wait
          'til it passes.
          But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees
          PERCY being carried into the prison wagon. Followed by Jake.

                         DOLARHYDE
          No time, they put him in an iron coach.
          With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks
          -- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          As Jake's loaded into the prison wagon after the still-
          unconscious Percy, he SEES MEACHAM through the barred window.
          The preacher flashes SYMPATHY as Wade takes out the cuff key:

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Gimme your wrist.
          Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a
          cuff... then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.

                         JAKE
          What're you --?

                         CHARLIE
          Best way to make a man stay put: chain
          him to his enemy.

                         (A GRIN)
          You lovebirds have a nice trip now.
          SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit
          back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit.
          Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down:
          HIS BRACELET. Has started PULSING RED. And it's getting WARM.
          Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening? As --
          OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard. EMMETT feeds the horses:

                         EMMETT
          You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give
          Percy a lickin'.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          He's bad enough.

                         EMMETT
          (not so sure, but --)
          . can I come with you?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Too dangerous.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         EMMETT
          Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why
          can't Charlie just take him?

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what
          these people pay me to do. And your
          mother would kill me if I brought you.
          Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --

                         EMMETT
          Good thing she's already dead then.
          And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing
          he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS:
          THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster
          toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE.
          IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing
          growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE:

          ELLA (0.S. )

          HEY!
          Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Tell me where you got that bracelet...

                         JAKE
          Maybe you should'a asked before you
          knocked me out..

                         ELLA
          Please... I need to know. Just tell me
          where you got it.

                         JAKE
          Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my
          name or where I've been or any of the
          things they said I done, so leave me the
          hell alone.
          And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the
          dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback
          cover the coach in a protective ring.
          Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:

                         DEPUTY WADE

          KYLE!!!
          Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

                         DAMNIT --
          He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons --
          ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too --
          This is about to get UGLY. BUT... from the OTHER end of town,
          the WIND picks up --
          As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A
          H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and... TWO BOLTS OF BLUE
          LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella
          sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear:

                         ELLA
          NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS! EVERYONE

          UNDERGROUND NAT!
          But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!!

          A LONG, NARROW FUNNEL SHOOTS FROM THE CHURNING CLOUD: A TORNADO!

          BREAKING THE MOMENTUM OF THE SHOWDOWN --
          The stagecoach UPENDS, FLIPPING SIDEWAYS as the animals try to
          break free -- Taggart and his men are THROWN --
          Inside, Jake and Percy TUMBLE end-over-end -- SLAMMING into
          walls, LOCKED TOGETHER -- JARRING Percy back to consciousness --
          Dolarhyde's men are THROWN from their horses too as the animals
          STAMPEDE OFF in different directions --
          THE 1Q8k=O ENGULFS THE TOWN! THE CONCUSSIVE BLAST BUCKLES

          BUILDINGS, PULLING WHOLE SECTIONS OF THEM INTO THE SKY!

          THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE. SHERIFF'S STATION. BROTHEL. WOOD

          STRIPPED RIGHT OFF THEIR FALSE FRONTS LIKE PIANO KEYS!
          Okay, wait. Just wait. Take a breath. 'Cause it's
          about ... . to get... . MORE insane...

          TEN MANTA RAY-SHAPED HOVER-SPEEDERS BURST FROM THE CYCLONE!
          ROARING into the town, FLYING just above ground --

          TOWNSPEOPLE'S FACES -- GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE -- 19TH

          CENTURY BRAINS TRYING TO PROCESS THE IMPOSSIBLE --

                         MEACHAM
          Jesus God!!
          STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out --
          KA-CHING! -- SNAP OPEN and CLAMP around necks, arms, legs -- and
          from these steel collars, CABLES LASH OUT, whip-snapping back to
          the speeders and TETHERING MAGNETICALLY to them --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Yeah-these are HIGH-TECH LASSOS:

          HELPLESS VICTIMS ARE YANKED OFF THE GROUND AND PULLED BEHIND THE
          SPEEDERS LIKE ROPED STEER! Two of TAGGART'S GUNMEN. Now some
          of DOLARYHYDE' S. Screaming, just gone. THIS IS A...Qlp lam.
          EMMETT -- stunned -- as SHERIFF TAGGART runs for him --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          EMMETT !
          Emmett runs into his dad's embrace --

          EMMETT SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's happening?! -- Stay _by-mvside!
           A_LIVERY_STABLE -- the HORSES stamp in their stalls as Taggart
           tears the door open and rushes Emmett inside; as he's about to
          follow... am c1:t lU 01 If

                          EMMETT

          PA!!
          -- a STEEL CABLE fires from the collar, SNAPS TAUT as it
          connects to a speeder and WHOOSH! Taggart's RIPPED off his
          feet, dragged away -- ELLA tackles the boy as ANOTHER RING zooms
          overhead, locks around a FLEEING WOMAN -- she's TAKEN --

                         EMMETT (CONT'D)

          THEY TOOK HIM! LEMME 9Q11!!

                         ELLA

          THERE A CELLAR?! TAKE ME TO IT!

          -- HE'S COMING INTO FOCUS -- TEARS IN HIS EYES --

                         EMMETT

          BIRDCAGE THEATER!
          With a "C'MON!!!" she rushes him through the FRENZIED CROWD --

          INT. PRISON WAGON - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE AND !MERCY -- TRAPPED IN THE UPSIDE-DOWN COACH -- Jake sees
          DEPUTY WADE on the ground just a few feet away, head bleeding --

                         JAKE

          HEY!! LET US OUT!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          -- but WHOOSH! A METAL COLLAR CLAMPS AROUND WADE AND YANKS HIM
          AWAY! Percy STRUGGLES wildly against Jake in a TUG-O'-WAR:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

          STOP PULLING AND GIMME YOUR HAND--!

                         PERCY JAKE

          -- THE HELL FOR-- ?! -- I CAN GET US FREE! GIMME

          YOUR DAMN HAND!!!
          Percy RELENTS. Offers up his hand. Jake grabs all of Percy's

          FINGERS, TIGHTENS HIS FIST AROUND THEM -- CRRRRAAACKI
          SNAPS THEM BACKWARDS!!!!! Percy SHRIEKS as Jake KICKS him back
          against the wall, FORCING Percy's hand out of the cuff -- and
          now Jake's UNTETHERED too!
          THROUGH THE CROWD -- DOLARHYDE hears his son SCREAM. SEES the
          overturned coach and TWO-FINGER WHISTLES to:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Colorado!
          Nat Colorado RACES IN as Dolar draws his .45 -- BANG! --
          shatters the coach lock -- they PULL Percy out:

                         PERCY

          MY FINGERS!! HZ BE= MY FINGERS!!!

                         DOLARHYDE

          QUIT WHININ' AND FIND A HORSE!
          As Dolar runs for his horse, Percy sees a PISTOL left on the
          ground -- grabs it with his good hand and FIRES at Jake who
          JUKES behind the coach for cover, Percy SHOOTING in a FURY but:
          -- KLINK! A collar CLAMPS around Percy's neck and he's YANKED
          OFF TOO! Dolarhyde turns and SEES HIS SON DISAPPEAR:

          INT. MEACHAM' S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham ushers people into the church as WALLS SHAKE, PEWS JUMP:

          INT. BLACKSMITH'S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          DOC AND MARIA burst in, huddle under a window. Across the room,
          a YOUNG MAN clamps a hand over his TERRIFIED WIFE's mouth --

          CRAAASFI! MORE RINGS SMASH THROUGH THE WALL, YANKING THE YOUNG

          COUPLE THROUGH IT! ANOTHER RING CLAMPS AROUND MARIA'S NECK!

                         MARIA

          AYUDAMEEEEEEE!
          Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out,
          TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR --

          MARIA!!!

          EXT. BIRDCAGE THEATER - CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

          ELLA -- hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a
          SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them --
          ON JAKE. He SEES this -- and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much
          as OURS... HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! METAL COMING TO LIFE,
          coiling up around his arm -- WHAT? HOW? -- as it becomes...

          A SMART GUN BLASTER WE PON! A HOLOGRAPHIC SCOPE MATERIALIZES,
          tracking that speeder as it DESCENDS on Ella and the mother and:

          BALLLLAMMMI THE BLASTER FIRES A PULSE, VAPORIZING THE SPEEDER

          MID-AIR! THE RECOIL HURTLES JAKE BACK 15 FEET, INTO A WALL.
          Ella reaches the CELLAR DOOR with Emmett. LOCKED. Sees a
          HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits:

                         ELLA
          Everyone inside! GO GO GO!!
          Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT --

          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE stumbles up... as a speeder FIRES A RING AT HIM. But
          reflexively, his WRIST WEAPON FIRES ANOTHER BLAST, vaporizing
          it! He looks down at the blaster: "Hell y ."
          Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM! The blaster's
          incredible firepower SPIRALS THE SPEEDER OUT OF CONTROL, it

                         CRASHES INTO:

          INT. MEACHAM'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          The speeder PLOWS through, parishioners flee -- the CHURCH BELL
          breaks from the BELL TOWER -- CRASHES DOWN ON THE SPEEDER --

          EXT. TOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          As Jake keeps FIRING, the last speeders turn tail and RETREAT --
          disappearing back INTO THE TORNADO as the cloud overhead OPENS
          UP and INHALES the swirling mass, which spirals to the heavens.
          ... GONE. The massive cloud seems to VAPORIZE and the DESERT
          SUN returns... debris flutters... smoke clears...
          And all... is... STILL.
          As our CAMERA RISES to reveal... HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN

          SUCKED INTO THE SKY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          From the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the
          cellar with inhabitants. DOLARHYDE. DOC. Al in SHOCK:

                         DOC
          Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What
          just...?
          MOANS, WAILS... desperate cries as people search for loved ones.
          JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down
          to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are
          the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Who the hell're ?

                         NAT COLORADO
          He's the one who caged Percy.
          Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Whatwere__tho_se__thinae?

                         JAKE
          -- why're you asking m&?!
          Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET:

                         DOLARHYDE
          This! Where'd you get this?! It was
          shooting the same light beams they were --

                         JAKE
          Let go of my wrist.

                         DOLARHYDE
          -- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you
          tell me what the he--
          KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the
          church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out
          of the church stumbles...
          AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted --
           limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and
          Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES:
          WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET ---

          SCHLUCK!!!! -- EMBEDDING IN THE ALIEN'S HEAD! WHIP TO --
          ELLA, hang iust hurled it. The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE
          then FALLS FORWARD, the hatchet embedding deeper as it HITS THE
          DIRT. Holy SHIT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          Ella's adrenaline dynamo starts to die down, replaced now by
          SHOCK. And for what seems like the first time, FEAR. She
          EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back... as slowly... people
          converge around the corpse:

                         EMMETT
          Is it... dead?
          Jake KICKS the alien. It doesn't move. Happy BARKS --

                         DOLARHYDE
          . The hell j,,a it?

          MEACHAM (O.S.)
          A demon.
          They all turn to see MEACHAM. TERRIFIED.

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          Revelations 16:14: "For there are
          spirits of demons, showing signs."
          (points to the alien)
          Escaped from hell itself.

                         EMMETT
          Lookit its wrist! It's got one'a those
          bracelet things too!
          Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET.
          ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as
          EAGER as his to understand this and now... BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
          What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado
          bends closer to the corpse... SCARED...

                         NAT COLORADO
          I think... it's comin' from somewhere
          inside it.
          People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near-
          hysteria they all feel. Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH --
          more BRAVADO than actual courage:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Only one way to find out. We need to cut
          it open.

                         (TO DOC)
          You're a doctor. Got a bone saw?
          DOC snaps out of his stupor, looks up, FREAKED --

                         DOC
          . Are you... serious?
          (looks to them all)

          WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Wake u Those things took your wife --

                         DOC

          I KNOW THAT!!

                         DOLARHYDE
          Well this one here's our only chance of
          findin' where they went.
          That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the
          thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head...

                         DOLLARHYDE
          So you got a bone saw or don't you?

          INT. GOLD LBAP SALOON - DAY

          THUD! The alien corpse is DROPPED onto the bar by Doc and
          Meacham. As Dolarhyde and Colorado follow through the batwings
          -- Doc WHIPS a SHOTGUN from under the bar:

                         DOC
          Stay outside. You're not welcome in
          here!
          Dolar brings up his COLT -- so does COLORADO --

                         DOLARRYDE
          I own more of this town than any man in
          it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn
          please. And for the record? You ain't
          welcome in my country, Mexican.
          Ella steps between them, BAD ASS --

                         ELLA
          Whatever troubles you had don't mean a
          damn thing against the ones we got now.
          We wanna see our way through 'em, your
          guns better start pointing in the same
          direction, Goddammit.
          Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS.
          Finally... Dolar LOWERS his. So does Doc. People BREATHE.
          Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and
          muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns
          his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE
          SAW. Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR...
          SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST.
          Looks at Meacham, AFRAID --

          Meacham hesitates a beat, then CROSSES the air in front of Doc --

                         MEACHAM
          That should cover ya.
          ON DOC. Little relief. BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning
          blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN -- VRRRRZZ -- HESITATES --

          Excuse me.

                         EMMETT
          Jesus, Doc!!!
          Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT --

          This is not normal. I'm entitled to
          vomit. We should XU be vomiting.

          Just cut, Lardass.
          Doc GLARES... with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business --

          VRRRRZ -- CUTS THROUGH THE STERNUM -- ORANGE BLOOD SPRAYING --
          and... SHUNK! Doc looks up at Jake, gestures to the carcass:

                         DOC
          Senor? A hand?

                         (TO DOLARHYDE)
          You too, maricon.
          The men all grip the chest plate and PULL -- A DISGUSTING CRACK.
          Everyone turns away, scowling, Emmett wafting the air:

                         EMMETT
          Damn! Smells like a dead dog's ass.

                         MEACHAM

          33.
          SUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN
          Dolarhyde against the wall! Everyone tries to PRY the claws
          from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the
          alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP. Dolarhyde drops, GASPING...

                         DOC
          Spinal reflex.
          And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around
          Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:

                         MEACHAM
          Something on your neck. Hold still.
          Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb
          and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
          I'll be damned... gold.
          They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath
          'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet:

          (looks to Dolar)
          This much ore... could only have come
          from a digging in a mine.
          That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up
          to see Jake READING her in this moment.

          In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in
          time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.

          Gimme my scalpel.
          In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he
          pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE
          dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB:
          -- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the
          light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion.
          Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Where'd it go? The hell'd you do?

                         DOC
          Nothing, just pulled it off --
          He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS:

          No matter how you move it, it points in
          the same direction.

          Compasses point north. That's west.

          (realizing; to Jake)
          West's where 141 came from.
          ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place.

                         EMMETT
          If you're right, what's it pointing to?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Then that's where I'm goin'.
          He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          One of my ranchers said my herd
          disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten

          Your b was taken too.
          A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION?
          But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I noticed.

                         NAT COLORADO
          What if they're already dead?

                         EMMETT
          They're not dead.

                         ELLA
          Kid's right. If all they wanted was to
          kill us, they would've.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Looked to me like... they were ropin'
          people.

                         (THEN)
          Means they need 'em for something.
          Whatever it is, we can either stand here
          guessin'... or go find out.
          His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon." And they EXIT. Everyone looks
          at each other, working up the courage to face what they know
          they must. Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells:

                         DOC
          If she's alive -- if there's even a

          Lord hates a coward... but our bullets
          were useless against those things. Other
          than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and
          outnumbered.
          As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has
          been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy
          to potential savior in a heartbeat.

                         JAKE
          Whoa, I got nothing to do with this --

                         ELLA
          You got everything to do with it. If you
          can remember where you got that thing --

                         JAKE
          I remember you all wantin' me on the end
          of a damned rope. Whatever's happenin'

          You sure. about that?
          He LOOKS at her. No, he isn't. But he sure as hell won't stay
          to debate it -- turns to go --

                         EMMETT
          Mr. Lonergan? Sir?
          The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.

                         EMMETT (CONT'D)
          My mother died last year. My Paw... he's

          36.
          And despite a fleeting moment of SYMPATHY, Jake darkens --

                         JAKE
          Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere
          near you, your Pa... or anyone else in
          this goddamned town.
          OUT the door. Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:

          EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

          Jake moves FAST past blown-out STOREFRONTS as Ella PURSUES:

                         ELLA
          That's it? You're just gonna run away?

                         JAKE
          No, Sister. I'm walking away.

                         ELLA
          Well s w.
          As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the
          back of his HEAD -- WHAMI Jake stumbles forward, TURNS AROUND --

                         JAKE ELLA
          SONOVA-- -- I told you to gyp.
          Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move --

                         JAKE
          What's your damn problem?!

                         ELLA
          You're comin' with us.

                         JAKE
          I'm not coming anywhere. And you throw
          that rock I swear I'll--
          WHAM! The rock glances off his shoulder --

                         ELLA
          If you're walkin' away from here, what
          the hell're you walking tsQ?
          That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW. And
          that's the last thing he's gonna admit --

                         JAKE
          What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady?
          'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like
          suicide to me.
          -- now it's her turn to pause. Cryptically:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         ELLA
          I... just wanna help these people.

                         JAKE
          Bullshit. You wanna help yourself. Saw
          your face light up the minute you knew
          that thing might lead you to gold.
          And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up --

                         ELLA
          It's not gold I want, you dumb
          sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.

                         JAKE
          And what's that?

                         ELLA
          Remange.
          Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She
          stares at him, DEAD ON:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          And lookin' at you? I'd bet a silver
          dollar... its what you want, too.
          With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face
          knotted in conflict. As her words RESONATE.

          scared. They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort.
          Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN (6) load the ALIEN
          CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances --
          DAMN WORRIED about staying. Dolarhyde sees it:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Somebody got something to say?
          His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and
          Meacham climb onto the wagon:

                         MEACHAM

                         (THE ALIEN)
          Sure we need to bring that thing along?
          Doc nods as he TWISTS the forceps in the Alien's eye, the
          COMPASS HOLOGRAM flickering to life before them:

                         DOC
          If this arrow points me back to Maria?
          Yeah -- J'm sure.
          Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung
          around his back:

                         MEACHAM
          Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.

                         EMMETT

          Somethin' tells me these things don't
          carry nickels, son. Answers's no.

                         EMMETT
          You want me to ride off with the
          chickenshits, then double back, be happy
          to. But let's just skip that part and
          get to it, Padre.
          And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally:

                         MEACHAM
          Go fill your canteen, dammit.
          He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and
          mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from
          Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:

                         ELLA
          C'mon, Happy.
          But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking
          up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?

                         JAKE
          Oh shut up.
          Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
          VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I was ridin' into town to kill you for
          what you done to my son. You owe me your
          life, Boy.

                         (BEAT)
          Ride with us, we'll call it square.
          His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38. Eyes gleaming cruelly.

                         JAKE
          You that fast?

                         DOLARHYDE

                         FAST ENOU--
          -- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having
          drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:

                         JAKE
          Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square.
          In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point
          made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out-
          drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Follow him. Soon as he's got his back
          turned... kill him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          Shit. Colorado hesitates. Dolar GLARES: "Do it." Finally
          Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off...
          JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and
          Doc on the WAGON:

                         MEACHAM
          Figure out which way you're headed yet?

                         JAKE
          West. Saguaro Pass.

                         MEACHAM
          That's not what I meant.
          The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off.
          Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS


          JAKE -- RIDING HARD THROUGH THE DESERT:
          A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through
          plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN:
          "SAGUARO PASS." Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS...
          Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE
          CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL:

          EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY

          A DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in
          Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED. Dismounts, tentatively... walks up to
          the PORCH. Boots CRUNCH over broken window glass as they ENTER:

          INT. ABANDONED CABIN - CONTINUOUS

          LIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet.
          Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot --
          DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE.
          Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS:
          MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B&
          FROM JAKE'S PICTURE. She smiles at him --

                         THE WOMAN
          You shouldn't have.
          She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's
          talking to JAKE.

                         JAKE
          Got you somethin' else.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          CLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase.
          A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED:

                         THE WOMAN
          Where'd you get this?

                         JAKE
          Where do you think?
          The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins.
          TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.

                         THE WOMAN
          Your boys '11 come after you.
          ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED:

                         JAKE
          Let 'em come.
          She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft.
          Tender. Soulful.
          But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window:
          A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town.
          The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch
          slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and --

          BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
          REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman?
          Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be:

          ONE OF THE GOLD COINS
          EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand
          questions in his eyes. Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and --
          MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the
          floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY
          -- WHOOSH! -- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE!

                         THE WOMAN
          What's happening?!!!

          WINDOWS EXPLODE! THE ROOF'S RIPPED AWAY BY SOME NSANE VACUUM
          FORCE AS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT CRASHES IN! The Woman SCREAMS and --

          KA-CHINNNG! A STEEL COLLAR SHOOTS DOWN FROM THE LIGHT, CLAMPING

          AROUND HER NECK! A CABLE SNAPS OUT FROM IT AND WHIPS UPWARD,

          PULLING HER INTO THE LIGHT --
          She manages to GRAB a doorknob and DANGLES UPWARD, CHOKING as --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          A DEMONIC SILHOUETTE drops in front of them!
          JESUS!! Jake draws his pistol and FIRES!
           The demon SHRIEKS IN RAGE as SPIKED PLUMES fan out from its
           huge, elongated skull... making it look like a SILHOUETTED
          It QIAï¿½1.-L 2 A T EI! R HEADDRESS!
           Its HIDEOUS FACE comes into the light -- AN AIJIE -- as it
           raises its arm, wearing a WRIST BRACELET that reshapes into a

                         BLASTER --
           JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his
          side (now we know how he woke up with it in the desert) --

          THE PULSE PASSES THROUGH JAKE AND HITS THE WOMAN SQUARE IN THE
          C-Mr-M. She 's HURLED backward into the wall, Jake. CRIES OUT:

                         JAKE
          Alice!
          As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS... and FLIES AT JAKE,
          clamping HE'S PULLED INTO THE LIGHT, CHOKING, SCREAMING --

          BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
          As he STUMBLES back -- GASPING -- touching his neck --
          Catches his breath. ROCKED. Sees "Alice's" BLOOD STAIN on the
          wall. His shaking hand reaches out, brushes over it...

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          (trying out the name)
          "Alice"...
          Whoever she was to him, he feels sledgehammered with GRIEF. All
          he knows is, it was THEM. The creatures killed her. And this
          revelation... well, it galvanizes him with RAGE.
          Rage that gives him NEW PURPOSE... then--

          SUDDENLY -- INSTINCT -- JAKE SENSING SOMETHING IS HERE -- GRABS

          A CHIMNEY STONE AND SPINS, HURLS IT...

          AT COLORADO, IN THE DOORWAY BEHIND HIM AIMING A GUN:
          The stone HITS Colorado as he FIRES, the bullet tears PAST Jake
          -- as Colorado recovers, Jake BODYSLAMS HIM -- the GUN goes
          flying, they go hurling THROUGH THE WALL -- LANDING HARD on the
          other side -- aaballs-out. messy. close-quarter death match --
          Jake takes a PUNCH -- Colorado LOOPS an arm around his throat,
          YANKS -- they TUMBLE/SLAM to the floor, Jake LANDING on top of
          Colorado who holds the arm lock, CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          Jake -- EYES POPPING -- SEES THE GUN just out of reach --
          fingers GRASP for it -- seconds before he PASSES OUT
          He GRABS the gun and swings it back -- BLAMMII!Colorado ROLLS
          aside as the WALL where his head just was BLOWSOPEN--and
          Jake's ON HIM, PISTOL WHIPPING HIM MERCILESSLYuntilheSPINS
          the gun back around and POINTS IT between Colorado's eyes:
          ON JAKE -- quaking with rage -- he wants to kill this guy so bad
          he can taste it... but something's HOLDING HIM BACK -- GRITS his
          teeth, COCKS the trigger and:

          EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY

          -- we CUT WIDE on the cabin as a GUNSHOT CRACKS. A flock of
          BIRDS screech into the sky from the overgrown corn field...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - DAY

          The rest of our people RIDE along, following the ever-tilting
          HOLOGRAPHIC ARROW, their COMPASS, floating from the dead alien's
          eye in the back of the wagon.
          Greavey, Dolar's ranch hand, heels up to ELLA. COCKY SWAGGER:

                         GREAVEY
          So... what's a pretty lady like y--

                         ELLA
          -- you finish that sentence, I shoot you
          in your beef whistle.
          Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes
          DRILL Greavey. Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced:

                         GREAVEY
          Ma'am.
          And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Tell me somethin', Kid... why didn't your
          father just take my money?

                         EMMETT

                         (CONFUSED)
          What money?

                         UOLARHY DE
          offered him a thousand dollars to leave
          town. He could's taken you outta harm's
          way, relocated... found you a new momma.
          And this just BURNS Emmett. A beat; then:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         EMMETT
          Is it true Percy's momma died givin'
          birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde?
          Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Yeah.

                         EMMETT
          Then maybe you should use that thousand
          dollars to buy yourself a new wife.
          Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and
          UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but
          it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:

                         DOC
          Madre Dios...
          And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's
          reacting to --
          AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even
          Dolarhyde looks nervous now:

                         DOLARYHYDE
          What the... hell is it?

                         MEACHAM
          It was Winfield's Landing.
          They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN:
          Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133."
          ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?

                         GREAVEY
          You tryin' to tell me those... things
          pulled the whole damn town into the sky?
          And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND
          BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where:
          SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the
          tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at
          the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --

                         MEACHAM
          That can't be good.
          The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND

          PLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Scatter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          -- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over
          rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP.
          They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly...
          DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING:
          It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of
          TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a
          GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH.
          The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK
          and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE.

                         DOC
          Should we... open it?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn--

                         EMMETT
          -- oops --
          -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a
          Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks --
          then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING
          the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out.
          BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
          FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:

          A COW. YES, A COW.
          Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth,
          connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
          Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D":

                         GREAVEY
          Boss... it's one'a yours.
          Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:

                         EMMETT
          Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
          Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
          with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:

                         DOC
          This was stuck down its throat... to help
          it breathe. That means they wanted to
          keep it alive, Emmett.
          (forces a small smile)
          I'm sure your father is fine.
          But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         MEACHAM
          Why'd they dump it?

                         ELLA
          Whatever they needed from it, they
          must've got.

                         (THEN)
          Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving.
          She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is
          DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - DUSK

          Now our people APPEAR riding up a ridge... Dolarhyde shoots up a
          HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP. Once again, SHOCK:

                         EMMETT
          Ho-ly shit.
          BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below:
          AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels
          facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the
          desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --

          EXT. DESERT - THE PADDLEBOAT - MINUTES LATER

          TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides
          around it. Trying to make SENSE. STENCILED on the stern is...

                         DOC
          "Colorado Queen."

                         (THEN)
          The river's two hundred miles from here.
          But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In
          fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up
          over the DUNES... the barest flicker of a smile --

                         ELLA
          Son of a bitch.
          IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with
          COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides
          to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS
          the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:

                         JAKE
          Your man got it in his head that he was
          s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his
          ear 'til he says sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar
          notices his BLOODY EAR. The LOBE has been SHOT OFF. He looks
          up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED --

                         DOLARHYDE
          Why'd you let him live?
          Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now --

                         JAKE
          Gonna need him.
          He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Nice boat.
          (then... SNIFFS)
          What's that smell?

                         ELLA
          That'd be me.
          He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.

                         JAKE
          Why're you blue?

                         ELLA

                         (DRYLY)
          Cause I missed ya.
          Their look HOLDS. A MOMENT. Something REAL between them.

                         DOLARHYDE
          We better keep movin'.
          A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.

                         JAKE
          Storm's comin'. I say we dig in here til
          it passes.
          (to Colorado; fucking

                         WITH HIM)
          How's that sound, Nat?
          Nat BURNS. Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'.
          Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Too hard tracking anything in the rain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.
          Dolarhyde GLARES at Colorado, who GLARES BACK: his loyalty now
          in QUESTION. The tide IS turning against the rancher.

          EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - NIGHT - LATER

          RAIN POURS on the overturned boat. Horses tethered. The ALIEN
          CORPSE has been moved onto a slanted deck, covered by a TARP...
          WE TILT TO THE ALIEN'S HAND. Poking out. Motionless. HOLD on
          it, longer than we're comfortable.

          INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A RATTLESNAKE is coiled around a CHANDELIER... except the
          chandelier is on the floor and the floor is the CEILING.
          Upended gambling tables. WOODRATS scurry over FOOD. Every
          window's SMASHED... as if something just TOOK everyone.
          Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a
          WHISKEY FLASK. Colorado opposite, rubbing his MANGLED EAR.

                         DOLARHYDE
          You okay?

                         COLORADO
          (low, eyes averted)
          Yeah.
          Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado --

                         DOLARHYDE COLORADO
          Lemme clean it for you or
          it'll get -- -- I'm fine.
          Dolarhyde backs away. Colorado GLARES.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Say it.

                         COLORADO
          (after a beat)
          Is Percy worth dyin' for?
          Dolar's eyes flash. A mixture of anger and PAIN. Then --

                         DOLARHYDE
          He's my son.

                         (POINTED)
          I take care of my kin, Nat.
          ON COLORADO as that lands. Clearly, there's something here...
          a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee. But
          WHAT? Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES.
          Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG. Hears a WHIMPER.
          Looks over and sees... EMMETT, huddled in a corner. CRYING.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          ON DOLARHYDE. The kid's naked emotion AFFECTING him, but the
          fact Dolar might have a conscience makes him ANGRY too. Low:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Hey. Kid.
          Emmett looks up, SNIFFLES. Dolar tosses him the WHISKEY FLASK:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Take a drink and shut p.
          He gets up, walks off. Leaving the kid with the flask. As
          Emmett looks at it confusedly, stuffs it in his POCKET --

          INT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Meacham has set out TIN PANS under holes to collect RAIN WATER.
          Dumps a pan into his CANTEEN as Doc enters with COFFEE for him:

                         DOC
          (re: the tin plates)
          We brought enough water.

                         MEACHAM
          Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'.
          Doc nods: ah. Turns to go... STOPS. Turns back. Intense eyes:

                         DOC
          Padre... Maria came to see you in
          confession every Sunday. It seemed...
          she had a lot to talk about.
          (beat, this is hard)
          Was she having an affair?
          Meacham removes his spectacles. Looks at Doc --

                         MEACHAM
          You know I can't say.
          And Doc DOES know. But there's a quiet DESPERATION here --

                         DOC
          The last thing I said to her... I...
          (shakes his head; then)
          Please. If I'm wrong about my wife... I
          don't want to die angry.
          Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.

                         MEACHAM
          You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on
          you once we get her back. 'Til then?
          (bit of a grin)
          Don't die.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          And OFF DOC, thunder CRACKS --

          INT. RIVERBOAT - COMMODORE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

          RAIN pours down through an open gash in the roof, splashing the
          floor. Ella enters, glances back toward the door to make sure
          she's alone, then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool.
          Upper body NAKED in the moonlight. We catch only a FLASH of
          this, and for a moment it's PURE HOTNESS...
          . until she turns and something ELSE is revealed: criss-
          crossed LASH MARKS on her back.
          She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water, erasing
          the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face... then: A MATCH
          ignites behind her. She WHIRLS, startled, covering her breasts
          with her arms -- JAKE is sitting in a chair at the Commodore's
          desk, casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth:

                         JAKE
          You missed a spot.

                         ELLA
          The hell,-re- you doing here?

                         JAKE
          Mindin' my own business.
          (snaps out the match)
          Then you decided to take a shower.

                         ELLA
          Why didn't you say anything?

                         JAKE
          Givin' you privacy.
          She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues
          to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
          Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a
          bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.

                         ELLA
          . she's pretty.
          (Jake says NOTHING)
          Who was she?
          Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:

                         JAKE
          only thing I know's her name was Alice...

                         (THEN; DISTANT)
          And she's dead.
          Ella looks up at him. INTO him --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         ELLA
          Maybe you loved her.
          Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:

                         JAKE
          All you women are the same -- Always
          wanna make it about Goddamn "love."

                         ELLA

                         (A BEAT)
          Trust me, Lonergan. I'm not the same.
          There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he
          connects with. But remains, true to character, ALOOF:

                         JAKE
          Don't matter.
          She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate.

                         ELLA
          So what dj= matter?
          Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips,
          the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light...

                         JAKE
          What matters is I find the thing that
          killed her.
          (dark as hell)
          And make it pay.
          And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his

                         BRACELET:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Where'd you see this before?
          A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie.
          But he cuts her off --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          -- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've
          asked me if you didn't recognize it.
          Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Those things... they the ones who put
          those marks on your back?
          She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and
          ANGER at what was done to her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         ELLA
          They took my people. Destroyed where I'm
          from.

                         JAKE
          Where's that?

                         ELLA
          North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever
          since, town to town. Best I figure,
          they're hidin' in a mine.
          Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little:

                         JAKE
          Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead
          of throwin' rocks at me --

                         ELLA
          -- what, you would've stuck around?
          Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away
          from what you had to do, any more than I
          could've stopped these people from going
          after their kin.

                         (BEAT)
          Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake... and
          we're gonna need all the guns we can get.
          Their look HOLDS... until Jake SMIRKS. Likes her style:

                         JAKE
          So that's the only reason you wanted me
          to come with you? Cause of my gun?
          There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back:

                         ELLA
          No, not your gun.

                         (BEAT)
          What you do with it.
          Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately
          and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION.
          Confusing as it is for him. The pregnant moment LINGERS...
          Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something
          outside. ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER as:

          INT. STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The horses STAMP NERVOUSLY out the window as Greavey and the
          rest of Dolarhyde's men (COBBETT and 4 others) HUDDLE in secret
          conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         GREAVEY
          What the hell're we doin' here? We
          should be ridin' in the opposite
          direction of those things --

                         COBBETT
          We do that, the old man's likely to shoot
          us himself. Only way outta this is --
          And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:

                         GREAVEY
          . what's that smell?
          -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY

          FIND IS AN EMPTY TARP FLAPPING AIMLESSLY:

                         COBBETT

                         AW SH--
          LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN
          behind them. a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!!
          Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett -- LIFTS HIM off his
          feet -- SLAMS HIM into the ceiling -- TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll:
          The men SHOUT -- a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the
          alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE --
          GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY:

          INT. RIVERBOAT - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS


          JAKE AND ELLA
          HEAR the SCREAMS -- Happy takes off -- they RACE after him --

          DOC AND MEACHAM
          Hear them too -- grabs their PISTOLS -- and Doc, his CANTEEN --
          DQIRHXPE_. 9oWQ n
          Colorado snatches up a WINCHESTER, LOADS IT, throws another one
          to Dolar -- who's suddenly, surprisingly, PROTECTIVE of Emmett:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Get behind me, Boy --
          THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM -- landing upside down on the
          ceiling. Dolar FIRES at it --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)

          RUN, KID! GIT!
          Emmett SCRAMBLES down a FLOOR HATCH, disappears as Dolar keeps
          FIRING -- but the alien BATS the gun away and LIFTS Dolar UP --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Paralyzed with FEAR, he EXHALES a terrified GASP and --
          THE CREATURE RECOILS FROM HIS BREATH! HURLS Dolar aside --
          THROUGH THE FIRE -- embers catch CURTAINS and FLAMES SPREAD --
          COLORADO races in, throws a TOMAHAWK -- it PINS the alien's claw
          to the wall, the monster SHRIEKS as Nat draws a PISTOL but --
          The alien SPITS A STICKY RESIN GOB -- it HARDENS, pinning NAT'S
          hand with the pistol to the wall in return. He STRUGGLES as the
          alien ADVANCES --
          BOOM! The Alien's shoulder EXPLODES ORANGE FLUORESCENT BLOOD as
          a GUNSHOT rings out -- it's Dolarhyde, back on his feet aid
          FIRING -- the monster SCREECHES and leaps down, DISAPPEARING
          through the hatch where Emmett fled --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)

          GODDAMMITT!!!
          And the fire's GROWING around the boat --

          INT. CRAWLSPACE - CONTINUOUS

          EMMETT moves FAST on hands-and-knees through a narrow CRAWLSPACE
          -- around a corner here -- another there -- a MAZE --

          SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM -- THE ALIEN -- CRAWLING FAST --
          EMMETT -- reaches another HATCH -- pushes through and OUT:

          INT. RIVERBOAT BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

          -- DROPPING onto the floor -- as we WHIP TO Jake racing in from
          around a corner -- but suddenly: THE ALIEN BURSTS FROM THE HATCH

          BEHIND EMMETT, SWEEPING HIM UP IN ITS CLUTCHES:
          Jake's bracelet OPENS UP into that BLASTER and it's AIMED at The
          Alien but the creature CUPS a hand around Emmett and LIFTS HIM
          off the floor, a TALONED FINGER pressed to the boy's THROAT:
          STANDOFF. ELLA rushes in. The creature sees her -- HISSES --

                         JAKE
          Don't know if you understand me... but
          you hurt that boy and I hurt you.

          CLOSE, EMMETT -- MUFFLED, TEARS LEAKING FROM HIS TERRIFIED EYES:

          BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, GO BACK TO

          HELL, DEMON!
          Meacham brings his CANTEEN down like a HATCHET, SPRAYING the
          alien with HOLY WATER... but NOTHING happens! And then --
          The Alien STRIKES -- SLAMMING MEACHAM BACK INTO A JUTTING PIECE

          OF IRON, IMPALING HIM --

                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)

          ! ! !
          The Alien SPRINGS through a doorway, TAKING EMMETT WITH IT.
          Ella RUSHES after it as Jake RUNS to Meacham, hanging impaled:

                         JAKE
          Easy, now... Don't move, dammit --

                         (TURNS; SHOUTING)

          DOC -- GET IN HERE NOW!

                         MEACHAM
          Go after the boy... then you get our
          people back...

                         JAKE
          Stop talking. DQW! GET YOUR ASS--
          But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE. GASPING:

                         MEACHAM
           Listen up... 'cause I'm not gonna be able
          to say it again --
          (pulls Jake CLOSE)
          God don't care who you were, Son... only
          who you Mg.
          ON JAKE. AFFECTED. With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC
          races through the growing FLAMES -- REACTS -- no time to mourn --

                         DOC

          JAKE -- WE GOTTA GO M!
          But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM
          away -- Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's
          forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES --

          EXT. UPENDED RIVERBOAT - DESERT - NIGHT

          The boat is a BALL OF FIRE in the pouring rain, as what remains
          of our heroes stumble out, COUGHING, devastated... Jake, Doc,
          Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN... and Ella and Happy
          atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD
          streaking into the desert. Happy BARKING MADLY. Ella drops to
          a knee, touches the orange blood as it WASHES AWAY in the rain:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         ELLA

          RAIN'S GONNA COVER ITS TRACKS!

                         NAT COLORADO
          That thing... was dead... it was d-ead...
          DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face... VULNERABLE and GUILTY:

                         DOLARHYDE
          I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed
          the kid.
          ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX
          in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE:

                         JAKE
          Then we'd better get him back.

                         SMASH TO:

          INT. STALACTITE CAVERN - NIGHT

          STALACTITES loom from the ceiling -- BAM! EMMETT is DROPPED on
          the floor of a sinister cave -- scrambles back from THE ALIEN:

                         EMMETT
          Damn. You are one ugly bastar--
          PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST
          PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move --
          can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED --
          The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches
          a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like...
          .. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy.
          The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and
          starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a
          Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS:
          This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON.
          Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES...

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - SUNRISE

          Our people RIDE FAST against the rising sun, on the hunt for
          Emmett. Colorado REARS his horse, kneels by a trace of ORANGE
          BLOOD on some rocks.

                         NAT COLORADO
          (looks off --)
          West.
          Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         GREAVEY
          Boss, only took one of them things to
          kill four of us. We got no chance here.
          Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED --

                         DOLARHYDE
          You're a goddamn coward.
          (to the others)
           You work for me, dammit. You're my
          m e 1 1 Qyees.
          And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY:

                         GREAVEY
          Fine line between a coward and a fool.
          The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them --

                         DOLARHYDE
          You're all FIRED!
          Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife:

                         DOC
          Looks like they finally found something
          to be more scared of than you.
          Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man...
          Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS
          overhead with a bad feeling:

                         JAKE
          Clouds've been moving east since sun-
          up... 'cept that one.
          ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't
          saying. SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF:

          INT. BOX CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          As the group gallops into a BOX CANYON, Happy starts BARKING
          MADLY -- the horses SLOW --

                         ELLA

                         SOMETHING'S WRON--
          BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground --
          the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled --
          A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS
          with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         OUTLAW GUNMAN

          EVERYBODY DRAW YOUR GUNS SLOW AND TOSS

          'EM ON THE GODDAMNED GROUNDI

          SHIT.
          SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun... tosses it. Now the rest of them.
          As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of
          the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS...
          One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle --

                         OUTLAW
          I say we just shoot 'em and take their--
          But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN:

                         OUTLAW (CONT'D)
          . Boss?
          Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC
          -JAKE. Both outlaws
          and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE:

                         HUNT
          What the hell you doin' back here,
          Lonergan?
          Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA.
          COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't
          REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS:

                         BRONC
          Jesus, Boss... Creek's gonna shit when he
          sees you.
          (then; re: the others)
          And who the hell're they?
          ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him,
          SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY --

                         HUNT
          What's the matter, Jake. Cat got your--?
          SMACKI Jake moves LIGHTNING FAST, SLAPS Hunt across the face,
          stopping the question on his tongue -- CATCHES the gun as it
          drops and presses the barrel into Hunt's NECK:

                         JAKE
          Since when're Qy the one asking the
          goddamned questions!?!
          Ella and our people REACT as Jake plays it up, beat defense a
          good OFFENSE. The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they
          know. Hunt holds his BLOODY MOUTH:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         HUNT
          Christ, Jake... You broke my tooth

                         JAKE
          Quit whining. Now bring me to the rest
          of the boys, if that meets with your
          goddamn approval.
          Bronc and Hunt nod, mounting up, SHOUTING to the OUTLAWS above:

                         BRONC

          LONERGAN'S BACK. MEET US AT THE CAMP!
          As they RIDE OFF, Dolarhyde looks to Jake and mutters:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Nice company you keep.

                         ELLA
          What the hell're you doing? If we don't
          catch up to that kid, we're never gonna--

                         JAKE
          They called me "Boss." You wanna go
          after these things with five or fifty?
          (off her look)
          Like you said: we can use every gun we
          can get.
          Qh. That actually makes SENSE. But --

                         ELLA
          What exactly're you gonna say to 'em?

                         JAKE

                         (A BEAT)
          Tell you when I figure it out.
          And he SPURS onward, leaving her to follow uneasily --

          INT. STALACTITE CAVERN - DAY


          CLOSE -- RUBIK'S CUBE -- STILL SPINNING MID-AIR AS:
          OUR ALIEN HANGS UPSIDE DOWN from stalactites by four spindly
          limbs. Mid sleep cycle. And inches below its head...
          EMMETT, still webbed to the wall. Unable to move or speak,
          TERRIFIED. As suddenly... the cube DEACTIVATES. And DROPS --
          THE CREATURE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. It SPRINGS from the ceiling as
          FOUR DARK SHAPES blot out light, GLIDING IN...

          MANTRA RAY HOVER SPEEDERS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          A gang of FOUR MORE ALIENS dismounts. The biggest and STRONGEST
          -- their LEADER -- barks GUTTURAL CLICKS at the alien who
          kidnapped Emmett. Kidnapper explaining as it removes another
          STRANGE DEVICE. The device beams a HOLO-PROJECTION...
          OF ELLA'S FACE! The aliens HISS in furious RECOGNITION.
          JESUS... is this some kind of otherworldly WANTED POSTER?
          PLUMES fan out angrily from the Leader's HUGE, ELONGATED SKULL --
          like an indian headdress! The creature TURNS to Emmett --
          It's the alien who killed Jake's woman! We'll come to know it
          as... THE SLAVER.
          It MOVES OMINOUSLY for Emmett, grasping the HANDLE of something
          that UNCOILS with fluid, frightening speed:
          A WHITE-HOT LASER WHIP. This will be The Slaver's SIGNATURE
          WEAPON. It spirals to its full length, FLASHING out at --
          EMMETT -- MUFFLED SCREAM! But... the whip DOESN'T cut him,
          instead it SLICES THROUGH THE WEBBING that pins the boy to the
          wall. As Emmett FALLS, The Slaver SWEEPS HIM UP -- Emmett
          FLAILS, punching, kicking to no avail -- but then:

                         DOLARHYDE'S FLASK
          Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver
          -- IT.. S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING!
          EMMETT -- tumbles away. Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS
          the webbing from his mouth:

                         EMMETT
          Holy SHIT.
          Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with
          the flask -- the alien RECOILS, flesh BUBBLING --
          Emmett whirls -- sees the HOVERBIKES -- JUMPS onto one, twisting
           desperately at the controls --- IiON-DO , ï¿½'T THIS TURNS,__
          WO ?!! Another Alien SCUTTLES in FAST -- Emmett's scrambling
          boots slide into the foot supports, which automatically WHIR
          CLOSED as the bike THROTTLES FORWARD... DECAPITATING THE ALIEN!
          The bike SPINS UNCONTROLLABLY, plasma thrusters SCORCHING WALLS
          and setting two more aliens ABLAZE! The speeder KAMIKAZE
          BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming!
          The Slaver SCREECHES FURIOUSLY as the remaining creatures LEAP
          back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE!

          EXT. GANG ENCAMPMENT - DAY


                         A TARANTULA

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Climbing onto an old desert stump -- BLAM! It's SHOT OFF by a
          couple DRUNK OUTLAWS, swigging booze from STOLEN WHISKEY CRATES
          piled on a WAGON. We're in an OUTLAW CAMP: roughly 40 fast guns
          and saddle tramps. Tents. Horses. Ample weapons. And right
          now, most of them are GEARING UP to ride out for some reason...
          One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss
          cheese, slides a RIFLE into his saddle and shouts to the drunks:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Hey --- ï¿½s 4 Lay off that whiskey and
          saddle up. Flyer's on its way and we
          best damn be sober for it.

          HUNT (O.S.)
          Creek turns; sees HUNT and BRONC crest the hill with the other
          OUTLAWS from the cliffs. ANGRILY:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          'Bout time you got back.
          (re: Hunt's bloody nose)
          What the hell happened to you?!?
          Hunt nods over his shoulder --

                         HUNT
          He did.
          The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the
          rest of our people. Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          well, shit.
          It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing
          whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the
          gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is
          the man in charge. Dismounts:

                         JAKE
          You don't look happy to see me, Creek.
          Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          We're fixin' to rob us a train in about
          twenty minutes and you come ridin' in
          like nothin' ever happened?

                         (FUCK YOU)
          No. Lonergan. I ain't happy to see you.
          ON JAKE. How to navigate bad blood that he doesn't REMEMBER?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         JAKE
          Well I'm sure you'll get over it.
          Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the
          rest of the men. If he's their boss? Hï¿½ _gQDn&. CT LIR .ï¿½Tâ¢

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not
          going after a train -- We're going after
          something else.
          The men seem... . CONFUSED. Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.

                         BRONC
          But Jake... you-- you said you didn't
          wanna be in charge no more.
          And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep
          IMPROVISING to hold his ground:

                         JAKE
          Well, I-- changed my mind. So saddle the
          hell up.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          They're not going anywhere with you.
          Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          You got some balls on you -- walkin'
          outta here a week ago sayin' what you
          said and doin' what you did and then
          ridin' back in here and givin orders.
          Just who the hell do you think you are?
          The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks
          right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with
          a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          So. Are you her?

                         ELLA
          Am I who?

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          The whore Jake quit this gang for.
          OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes
          SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE... the men think she's
          " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:

                         JAKE
          Watch your mouth, Creek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Or what? These boys are with = now.
          jID in charge. You may be fast, but you
          are goddamned outgunned.
          ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men --

                         JAKE
          That a fact, Boys?
          But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Put your guns on the whore. He so much
          as twitches, blow her brains out her ear.
          AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
           the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:

                         JAKE
          Call her a whore again, that'll be the
          last word you ever say.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          You ain't in no position to make threats,
          asshole. Hunt: take his gun.
          Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls
          the PISTOL from Jake's holster:

                         HUNT
          Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal.
          Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Put him down, Bull.
          And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a
          JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI
          Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD --
          Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          Where the hell's our gold. Jake?
          "Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant:

                         JAKE
          Don't remember.
          Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA --
          at GUNPOINT. Wishing she could intervene. DOC too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was
          leavin' us high and dry because you were
          in love... You just left out the part
          about taking half our goddamned haul from
          the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one
          last time -- Where. Is. Our. Gold?
          -- WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET:

          CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
          Man can't run away from who he ja,
          Lonergan... you really think you could go
          straight just cause you were fool enough
          to fall in love with some woman?
          WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we:
          MEMORY FLASECUTi PEACEFUL SILENCE -- two FACES staring at each
          other across a pillow -- Jake and ALICE, naked, in a WHOREHOUSE

                         BEDROOM SOMEWHERE:

                         ALICE
          You sure you wanna give it all up?
          ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE.

                         JAKE
          What about you? Once we're gone, you
          ain't ever comin' back.
          She touches his face so gently. And whispers:

                         ALICE
          You're the first person ever believed I
          was better than this place... so I gotta
          believe in y=.
          (and she KISSES him)
          You're a good man, Jake Lonergan.
          PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_
          ]1â1n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist:

                         CREEK JOHNSON
          You figgered you could steal from us?
          All that gold was yours to take co you
          could go off and start a new life?
          Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another:
          TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he
          drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried:

                         ALICE
          Your boys'ii come after you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JAKE
          (dark, determined)
          Let 'em come.
          BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this
          moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at
          Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Okay... okay, I remember now...
          ("fuck you" grin)
          Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when
          you get to hell, you can ask for it back.

                         CREEK JOHNSON

                         (TSK'S)
          Okay then. That's the way you wanna do
          this...

                         (TURNS)
          Kill the whore.
          ON THE GANG. As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella --
          This is IT --
          JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as --

          HIS WRIST BRACELET ACTIVATES! BLAMMMM11! A SEARING PULSE BLAST

          FIRES, VAPORIZING CREEK JUST BEFORE HE PULLS THE TRIGGER!
          EVERYONE'S FACES. Holy shit. Jake spits on the around between
          the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek:

                         JAKE
          Told you not to call her that.
          ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of
          the (awestruck) gang -- through BLOODY TEETH:

                          JAKE (CONT'D)
          You're all riding with me. Any one of
          you decides otherwise? So help me God,
          I'll kill you where you stand.

                         (AND THEN)
          I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d
          The gang quickly flips: "Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say,
          Boss..." Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM
          IN THE BALLS as hard as he can, doubling him over.
          Now he meets eyes with ELLA. She can't help SMIRKING, grateful.
          DOC. Is the only one NOT looking at Jake. His attention drawn
          toward a SOUND coming from the distant DUNES --

                         DOC
          Dios mio.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

          A SPEEDER IS ROARING TOWARD THEM BOUNCING OVER DESERT:

                         DOLARHYDE
          (squints, realizing...)
          Jesus... it's the kid.
          As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER:

                         EMMETT

          THEY'RE COMING!!!! THEY'RE COMING!!!
          The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP,
          kicking up DIRT and UPENDING SUPPLIES. As Emmett scrambles up --

          VROOOM! FOUR MORE SPEEDERS ROAR OVER THE CREST IN PURSUIT OF

          EMMETT! THE ALIENS FROM THE CAVE!

                         JAKE

          EVERYBODY MOOOOVE!!!

          STEEL COLLARS START FLYING, ATTACHED TO ROPING CABLES -- BEFORE

          THE GANG KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY'RE BEING GRABBED AND

          DRAGGED AWAY!
          Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit
          the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION.

                         THE SLAVER
          His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker.
          ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd:
          QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is
          the one responsible for it. And we're:
          BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          You.

          BUT THE ACTION COMES ROARING BACK AS:
          Outlaws start FIRING at the Slaver, who REACTS in mere
          annoyance. Flicks open a POUCH on his bandolier for what look
          like THUMB TACKS -- throws them and they tan out, PIERCING THE
          NECKS of the outlaws, activating "Blue":
          !NTLY E ZE. TUR an
          The Slaver draws a ROL) that TELESCOPES into a SIX FOOT LANCE --
          KA-TCHING! BARBED ENDS snap out and the alien runs on two
          limbs, then FOUR -- LEOPARD-LIKE for speed -- rises back up and
          SMASH! SHATTERS each man into a million Pieces. Now he uses
          the bladed-ends to SKEWER five more outlaws and turns --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          MEETING JAKE'S EYES IN MUTUAL RECOGNITION -- SCREECHES:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

                         (TO DOLARHYDE)
          Find cover!!!
          Jake FIRES his pulse blaster, providing cover as DOLAR, DOC,
          EMMETT, and ELLA rush to hide behind the WAGON. The Aliens FIRE
          BACK as LASER CROSSFIRE shreds the camp -- EXPLOSIONS and CHAOS:
          THREE OUTLAWS scramble to form a GATLING CREW. It SPINS to
          life, MOWING DOWN tents as they try to hit the aliens --

                         ANOTHER ALIEN
          Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON." It circles past the
          GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as:

          THE TOP HALVES OFTHE_COWBOYS SLIDE OFF, SEVERED AT THE WAIST,'.
          An EXPLOSION blows one of whiskey crates open on the wagon:

                         EMMETT

          USE THE WHISKEY! IT BURNS EM!

                         ELLA

          -- WHAT?!

                         EMMETT

          LIKE ACID ON THEIR SKIN!!!
          Ella REACTS -- WHAT? As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs
          a bottle and HURLS IT -- it EXPLODES all over the creature! A
          HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically --

                         ELLA

                         (REVELATION)
          Oh my GOD --

                         DOLARHYDE

          LET'S GO!!!
          Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON
          buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him --
          As ELLA leaps on a horse --

                         THE SLAVER
          Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL
          COLLAR -- Jake turns -- SEES THIS. Starts RUNNING MADLY:

                         JAKE

          ELLA!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA
          OFF HER HORSE! The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the
          hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER

          SKIER BEHIND A SPEEDBOAT!
          ON JAKE -- FURY -- HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! And there's a LOGIC
          here we'll come to realize, as he KICKS his horse into a gallop:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)

          HYAA!

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

          ELLA'S DRAGGED BEHIND THE SPEEDER. Hands GRASPING at the
          magnetic collar as it HALF-CHOKES HER, yet keeps her upper body
          SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY --

          JAKE ON THE HORSE
          Riding hard -- aims his BLASTER, trying to get a TARGET on the
          CABLE linking Ella's collar to the speeder -- fires -- MISSES!
          The Slaver TILTS VERTICAL to fly through a narrow CANYON
          ENTRANCE as Ella's fingers reach wildly for THE BOWIE KNIFE on
          her belt. She starts CUTTING THE CABLE, trying to FREE HERSELF:
          WHOOSH! The speeder BLASTS out the other side of the canyon,
          Jake still in pursuit but suddenly...

          THE UNION PACIFIC LOCOMOTIVE IS CURVING AROUND A CORNER, RACING
          RIGHT FOR THEM! This is the train Jake's gang was gonna rob!

          INT. UNION PACIFIC EXPRESS CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Two PINKERTONS sit by a SAFE. LOOK UP at an unidentified ROAR --

                         PINKERTON #1
          You hear.that?

                         PINKERTON #2
          How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard.
          No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr--

          SWWWWWM. IN THE WINDOW BEHIND THEM... THE SPEEDER BLASTS BY.

          GOING AGAINST THE TRAIN, ELLA BOUNCING BEHIND IT.
          When the Pinkertons SNAP around, Ella's GONE... but now they SEE
          JAKE -- ON HORSEBACK -- FLASHING PAST in pursuit!

                          PINKERTON #2 (CONT'D)
          1 stand corrected.
          They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

          EXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - KID AIR AT 80 MPH - CONTINUOUS

          As the speeder SKIMS alongside the train, ELLA keeps struggling
          painfully to CUT HER COLLAR CABLE. Jake FIRES again, MISSES the
          cable but DETONATES THE SIDE OF A TRAIN CAR:

          INT. UNION PACIFIC - TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          The wall EXPLODES INWARD on the Pinkertons -- hurt, but ALIVE --

          EXT. UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          The speeder's SHAKEN. The Slaver GROWLS as he fights for
          balance. Reaches the TRAIN'S END, skims past the caboose and --

          DAMNIT. THE SLAVER ARCS BACK AROUND IN A WIDE U-TURN, SLOTTING

          IN FOR COVER BEHIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TMINâ¢,=_`T1.2AVF.LLING,.J

          THE SAME DIRECTION NOW!

          ELLA'S FLUNG WILDLY BY THE HAIRPIN TURN! SHE DROPS THE KNIFE,

          IT CLATTERS AWAY! HER ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE GONE!

                         JAKE'S POV:
          Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the
          opposite direction. Up ahead comes the CABOOSE. No more TRAIN:
          Thinking FAST, Jake LEAPS off his horse -- CATCHES A LADDER RUNG
          ON THE CABOOSE'. Teeth gritted, starts to CLIMB up onto:

          EXT. TOP OF UNION PACIFIC TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Jake JUMPS from car to car -- over LOGS in a TENDER CAR --
          BLAM BLAM!!! The PINKERTONS are climbing to the roof, WEAPONS
          FIRING -- Jake loses footing, ROLLING off the side --

          EXT. SIDE OF TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          -- but CATCHES another ladder rung and he DANGLES, looks DOWN:

          ELLA IS RIGHT UNDER HIM, DRAGGING BEHIND THE SPEEDER! HE

          REACHES OUT --

                         JAKE

          TAKE MY HAND!
          She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and
          The Slaver SNAPS AROUND. Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake -- no
          choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER -- HITS the ground PAINFULLY

          THE PINKERTONS RUSH TO THE ROOF EDGE
          -- SXLSKLISH! The disc VIVISECTS THEM THEN CIRCLES BACK AROUND,
          cutting the IRON STRAPS that secure the logs in the tender car --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          THE LOGS START ROLLING OFF THE TOP. CRASHING DOWN ON THE
          SPEEDER. It SPIRALS end-over-end, CRASHING into the desert!
          ON JAKE. He picks himself up, WINCING. Sees the SMOKING WRECK
          in the distance. Starts to limp, then RUN --

          EXT. CRASHED SPEEDER - CONTINUOUS

          Jake APPEARS through the smoke. No sign of The Slaver. Then --
          FALLING ROCKS turns his look upward. Though WOUNDED, the alien
          is SCALING a rock-face. Turns... a look that says "Next time."
          Then in a BLUR, it's GONE. Jake's blaster REVERTS into a
          bracelet. When the smoke clears:
          ELLA is revealed on the ground, thrown from the speeder. Jake
          REACTS -- EQ -- takes her in his arms.
          She desperately tries to SAY SOMETHING... but goes LIMP.

                         JAKE
          Ella...?
          Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's
          true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his
          dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as...
          HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado,
          Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:

                         EMMETT
          Aw no... is she --?
          Jake looks up -- unhinged --

                          NAT COLORADO
           We need to get out of here NOT.

          JAKE NAT COLORADO
          Not gonna leave her here -- L4Re.Xam --
          -- I'M NOT LEAVIN' HER! -- This is Apache territory!
          They catch us, they'll kill u--
          THHHHHHHUNKI The air SCREAMS as an ARROW pierces the ground
          inches from Jake's hand! Suddenly THIRTY MORE -- ALL AROUND
          THEM -- forming an instant circle perimeter as --
          APACHE WARRIORS FLASH DOWNHILL. Dolar dismounts, swings Emmett
          to the ground --

          NAT COLORADO (CONT'D)
          Nobody move.
          Jake and Emmett freeze. The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM.
          Fierce. BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          EXT. ARIZONA MOUNTAINS - TWILIGHT

          The sun DIPS behind the mountains... NIGHT FALLS...

          INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON ELLA'S DEAD FACE. Still. Beautiful. FIND JAKE, on
          his knees beside her, hands bound in front of him. An INDIAN
          WOMAN finishes wrapping the body in a shroud and LEAVES.
          Jake is alone. Overwhelmed. Raw. Something rising in him.
          Something he COULDN'T FACE... until this moment:.

                         JAKE
          I remember now.

                         (THEN; SOFTLY)
          I-- I did love her.
          And just saying it, saying those words, brings a swell of
          EMOTION to the surface... but he FIGHTS it. A losing battle, as
          his eyes WELL:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          She was like you. Seemed to think I was
          a good man.
          (finally, voice almost

                         CRACKS)
          But I couldn't save either of you.
          A beat... his bound hands gently touch her face...

          JAKE (CONT' D )
          Where's the good in that?
          His eyes CLOSE. Too much.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Ella.
          And that sits... then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES
          roughly enter, pull Jake up, FORCE HIM out:

          EXT. APACHE ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

          BAN! Our people are THROWN TO THEIR KNEES in a large CIRCLE OF
          APACHES. GUARDED by warriors with tomahawks and -- WHOOSH! A
          PYRE is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about Ella being
          dead, the BRAVES carry her roughly past --

                         JAKE

          HEY! GODDAMMIT DON'T YOU TOUCH--
          -- he's YANKED BACK and held in place as... ELLAIg BODY IS
          THROWN RIGHT INTO THE FLAMES. Jake helplessly watches her BURN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         EMMETT
          Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan.
          Those things... were lookin' for her.
          Had a picture and everything.
          That breaks the spell. Jake looks over --

                         JAKE
          What d'you mean... 'a picture'?

                         EMMETT
          Floatin', like that arrow thing we found
          in its eye.
          Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS
          and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF -- dark,
          wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS. He takes one look at his
          prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE.

                         DOC
          What'd he say?

                         COLORADO
          "Kill them. And make it quick."
          Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move
          for them, MENACING --

                         DOC
          Now'd be a good time to use your gun
          bracelet, my friend.
          But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him.
          His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE.
          Dolarhyde's grabbed first... PULLED FORWARD by one of the
          braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM --

                         DOLARRYDE

                         (SUBTITLED)

          SOP. DON'T DO THIS.
          SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides
          Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA
          ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          How is it that you speak our language?

                         UOLARHYUE (SUBTITLE)
          Because I'm a damn genius.
          Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS
          given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Forget about quick. Make him feel it.
          The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Two hundred head of cattle!
          Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow --

          DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)
          I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a
          here in a day's time if you let me go.
          ON GREY WOLF. Considering this.

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          And how do I know you'll come back?
          Dolarhyde nods to Colorado --

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          You can keep my associate here. if I
          don ' t come back, you can kill him.
          Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell
          these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches
          Dolar, looks right INTO HIM --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Why should I believe that you even care
          about this man?
          Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Because he's my son.
           Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado
          with those unyielding eyes --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Is this true?
          And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others:

                         COLORADO
          Yeah... he's my father.
          REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Three hundred head.
          Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's
          eyes. Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Two fifty.
          HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Cut him loose.
          The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go...

                         EMMETT
          Hey! What about =?!?
          ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast.

                         DOLARHYDE
          What about you, kid?
          And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind...
          GONE. And now, it's back to business --

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          Kill all of them except the half-breed.
          Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a
          Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with
          lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it:

                         JAKE
          What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT.
          And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH:

          FWOOM! THE PYRE SUDDENLY BILLOWS, TURNING FROM ORANGE TO GREEN

          TO WHITE -- EVERYONE BACKS AWAY AS --

          ELLA EMERGES FROM THE PYRE. WRAPPED IN A CAUL OF FIRE AND LIGHTI
          Except she isn't exactly Ella. She's a HUMANOID, incredibly
          close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely
          feminine, yet... ALJM.
          PANDEMONIUM. The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons
          as flames DISSIPATE off Ella's backlit form. Her skin RETURNS
          to human flesh-tone. Hair too. When she finally STOPS, she
          looks like the ELLA we've come to know and love. STANDS there:

                         ELLA
          . what... happened?
          ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED.

                         EMMETT
          You... died.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Ella looks around. Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her.

                         ELLA

                         (QUIETLY; CAUGHT)
          . oh.
          OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain --

          INT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          A deerskin shirt slips down over Ella's naked body.' A dark
          breechcloth is tied. She TURNS to us.: beautiful as ever.

          EXT. TEEPEE - NIGHT

          Ella emerges to find... JAKE. Standing outside.the teepee.
          HARD. And for a long moment, nothing is said. Until she takes
          a step TOWARD him:

                         ELLA
          If I'd told you on the boat, you never
          would'a trusted me --
          -- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he
          isn't showing it:

                         JAKE
          Did you hear what I said?

                         ELLA
          .. What?

                         JAKE
          When you were playin' possum. Did you
          hear what I mid?
          He's angry. Yes, even embarrassed. And because of it,
          something has SHUT DOWN in him again. That killer look is back.

                         ELLA
          No. I was mendin'.

                         (BEAT)
          It's like sleep.
          His eyes narrow, trying to understand:

                         JAKE
          How's it you look like one of us?

                         ELLA
          I can look like whatever I want to.

                         JAKE
          So you can't die?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         ELLA
          Sure I can. If my heart stops beating...
          just like you.

          .JAKE
          You're nothin' like me, Ella. You're
          one'a them.
          we can see that hurt her. But she deserved it, too. So
          desperately wants to reach him...

                         ELLA
          I'm not, Jake. I'm from a different
          place.
          He isn't sure what that means. Can he even trust her? Either
          way, she has ANSWER;. Darkly:

                         JAKE
          The one that took you.

                         (BEAT)
          It killed her.
          That LANDS on her. Knowing and painful.

                         ELLA
          They call him The Slaver. He's the one,
          gave me the scars. Broke me. And made
          me watch... while he killed my family
          too.
          Even with his guard up... Jake can't help but be STRUCK. As the
          sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to:

          EXT. BOX CANYON - RIM - NIGHT

          A SANDSTORM... through which a GHOSTLY FIGURE materializes...
          THE SLAVER. Moving with angry purpose toward the CANYON BLUFF.
          As he looks down into it, we hear the SOUNDS of MACHINERY below.
          But we DO__QT.YET_ REVEAL what it_ is__ he sees.
          He stalks down, LEAVING FRAME -- as we HOLD on the field of

          TWINKLING STARS ---

          ELLA (V.0.)
          For every drop of light in the sky,
          there's another world. Filled with
          life...

          EXT. APACHE CAMP - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

          Ella's in front of the campfire, surrounded by EVERYONE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         ELLA
          Our race was first to map the stars...
          that's why they came for us. Took our
          planet, piece by piece. Slaughtered
          anyone who fought hack. Ones who
          survived were turned into slaves.
          Trackers.
          She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF. There's immediate
          SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          They brought me aboard one of their scout
          ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to
          find other planets like mine. Planets
          they can take... people they can enslave.
          As the terrible gravity of all this HITS everyone, JAKE is first
          to understand...

                         JAKE
          X lead 'em here.
          Ella swallows. Wracked with GUILT.

                         EMMETT
          Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.

                         ELLA
          I never wanted this.
          (an EMOTIONAL beat)
          But they got... ways. Of making you do
          things.
          Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory. The inference is some kind of
          TORTURE. She pushes it away -- staying strong:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Been tryin' to make it right... tried to
          blow the ship to hell by burnin' up all
          their fuel, then escaped down here.

                         (BEAT)
          'Cept it didn't work... damn thing
          survived.

                         JAKE
          Where is it.
          Jake's determined -- he's got his OWN agenda. Ella looks up to
          that OMINOUS CLOUD. Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:

                         ELLA
          Hiding in that cloud. Way I figure,
          they'll find enough fuel to leave by
          tomorrow, midday. Then they'll bring
          back the others.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         DOC
          "others"?

                         ELLA
          The whole fleet. They'll take what they
          need. Everyone on this planet. Anything
          too weak to survive... they'll toss.
          Like that cow.
          Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.

                         NAT COLORADO
          What'd you mean, they're looking for
          "fuel"...?
          And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:

                         JAKE
          Gold. That's why they're in a mine.

                         ELLA
          (NODS, solemn)
          . wherever it is, that's where you
          escaped from -- and it's the only way
          back up to the ship.

                         (STEPS CLOSER)
          Even with your memory wiped, your
          instincts kicked in --

                         (HIS BRACELET:)
          That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet
          reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it
          reacts. Somehow you took it off one of
          'em... don't you remember any of it?
          ON JAKE. Deeply STIRRED. As he looks down at the BRACELET and:
          MEMORY FLASBCUTSI REPLAY POV as we're HELD DOWN in that CAVE
          the TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes
          One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to
          FLASH STEADILY -- HYPNOTICALLY -- PUvTNG OUR MIND --
          But our arm manages to BREAK FREE -- a BLADE hidden in our
          sleeve -- WE SLASH OFF THE. ALIEN'S HAND -- GRAB THE BRACELET off
          its severed limb -- it COILS around our wrist and ACTIVATES:
          BLAM SLAM! We BLAST the creature to oblivion -- we're FREE!
          JAKE IN PRESENT -- Eyes ALIVE with MEMORY:

                         JAKE
          I-- I blasted my way out...
          MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern --
          ESCAPE -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits
          us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          That STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON --
          the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven --
          JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          I remember seeing a tower... made of
          stone... on the rim of a canyon...
          Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated
          gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS:

                         ELLA
          What? What's he sayin'?!?
          Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:

                         COLORADO
          That rock you're talkin' about... he-
          knows where it is.

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT

          The Slaver ENTERS the gloom of an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. Two
          ALIENS melt from the dark to greet him with frightening HISSES.
          SENTRIES. We HOLD on the walls as something GLITTERS: GOLD.

          INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - SOMEWHERE

          CLOSE ON SHERIFF TAGGART'S REFLECTION IN MURKY WATER. As we
          TILT UP to reveal him hanging UPSIDE DOWN. Eyes flutter open.
          He's seen better days. Dazed. Turns his head slightly...

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          You... all right...?
          DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward.
          Groggy. Mostly SCARED:

                         MARIA

                         (BRAVE FACE)
          . Fantastic. You?

          CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS, ROTATING 180 DEGREES, TO REVEAL THEY'RE
          STUCK TO THE CEILING OVER A WATER GROTTO. The whole town of
          Absolution is here... a hundred others from the now-cratered
          town of Winfield's Landing, feet embedded in the ORANGE RESIN.
          Suddenly, PERCY DOLARHYDE sees a TERRIFYING SHADOW spread across
          the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE:

                         PERCY DOLARHYDE

          H-- HEY!!! THE HELL'S THA--?!
          -- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular
          beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART.
          Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED
          from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE:

          DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE

          KYLE!!!!
          ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging
          our men across the cavern where we reveal...
          . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE.
          Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating
          table. As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls.
          An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_
          seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe !
          WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT
          X-RAYS read their retinas -- HYPNOTIC -- as the men grow DOCILE
          and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI
          The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares.
          Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT
          CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their
          throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID.
          This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the
          COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert.
          More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS.
          We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING
          HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process.
          All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp
          behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear
          retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel...

          EXT. CANYON RIM - DANN

          Our people ride up a rocky slope with a few Apaches. Grey Wolf
          looks around and SPEAKS, Colorado translates:

                         NAT COLORADO
          This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe.
          As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts:

                         JAKE
          That's it.
          As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that
          MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          What looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below,
          amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels. Except this
          fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly
          bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun.
          DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for

          GOLD -- THESE ARE THE SAME DRILLS THAT LANDED IN OUR OPENING.
          Massive receptacles are FILLED with HUGE CHUNKS.
          ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive.

                         DOC
          Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort.
          Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          The Kiowa... they were taken too.
          Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a
          CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of
          the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky...

                         ELLA
          Transports. Way they get people and gold
          back and forth to the ship.

                         DOC
          Place is crawling with those things.
          We'll never even get close.
          Grey Wolf SPEAKS --

                         NAT COLORADO
          He says there's a back way in... The Twin
          Rivers run underneath this whole canyon.
          Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple
          miles East. Lead right down there.
          Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED.

                         JAKE
          The Slaver... he's up in that big cloud?
          Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE
          rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form:

          EXT. APACHE CAMP - DAY

          DOC. Skeptical, eyes narrow -- staring at Jake and Ella --
          surrounded by our team and the Apaches back at the APACHE CAMP:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         DOC
          Just so I got this straight... three of
          those things just kicked the shit out of
          your entire gang, took our whole town,
          and now you two're gonna ride right into
          that fort, try to hijack one'a those--
          He pauses on the word --

                         ELLA
          "Transports."

                         DOC

          Spaceshp.

                         DOC
          Then bring it down here and get everybody
          off alive? That's your big plan?
          Jake and Ella share a LOOK. Simply:

                         JAKE
          Yup.

                         DOC
          And just how do you figure on getting in
          there in the first place?

                         JAKE
          Poke a hornet's nest... they swarm
          at'cha.

                         ELLA
          You gotta draw 'em out. Buy us a
          distraction.
          A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:

                         DOC
          You want us to storm that fort? Against
          those things? With less than fifty men?
          It's suicide.

                         EMMETT
          It ain't, it's been done! I read at
          school how Ethan Allen and his Green
          Mountain Boys took Fort Ticonderoga, they
          weren't but a small garrison and they
          were outgunned --

                         ELLA
          We need all of you to make a stand.
          Together. It's the only way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         NAT COLORADO
          Make a stand with what?
          Jake turns to the WAGON they rode from Jake's gang camp -- the
          WHISKEY CRATES. Sweeps up a bottle:

                         JAKE
          This.
          An impossible mission. Sure death. Yet for the first time...
          they have an ADVANTAGE. Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:

                         EMMETT
          Hell, yeah. Let's squish some bugs.
          Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs. Jake looks to Nat for translation:

                         JAKE
          Somethin' funny?

                         NAT COLORADO
          Yeah... that you whites finally know what
          it feels like to face extinction. Now
          that we're on the same side, he says we
          can all die together.

                         (THEN)
          They're with us.
          The LOOK holds between them --

                         JAKE
          Guess that means you're not waitin' for
          your dad to come back.
          Colorado's face CLOUDS. Years of ANGER and RESENTMENT:

                         NAT COLORADO
          Been Woodrow Dolarhyde's son my whole
          life... first time he ever copped to it
          was to save his own ass.
          (not without emotion)
          He's not comin' back.
          And as Colorado TURNS away, the PERCUSSION finds another GEAR --

          MONTAGE -- OUR CLAN PREPARES FOR BATTLE:
          Pieces of CLOTH are RIPPED, stuffed inside the WHISKEY BOTTLES.

          MOLOTOV COCKTAILS...
          Emmett works with Apaches and their KIDS, roping WOOD together
          to build LADDERS and CATAPULTS...
          WAR PAINT is applied to faces in DARK STREAKS...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          Jake slips on his coat. Sees Emmett lead a horse to mount up
          with his BOW and ARROW QUIVER:

                         JAKE
          Not you, Kid.

                         EMMETT
          Aw, hell, we been through this. Ya can't
          stop me.
          Jake draws his gun, SPINS it in his palm, aims at Emmett's FOOT:

                         JAKE
          I can shoot you in the foot.

                         EMMETT
          Bu111i11SHIT.
          Jake SIGHS -- bluff called. Holsters the gun and takes a
          knee... but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment,
          he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:

                         JAKE
          You told me your daddy's all you got
          left. Want me to save his ass?
          Then park yours right there on the
          ground, you little shit. Got me?
          Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.

                         EMMETT
          Yeah. I gotcha.
          Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:

                         ELLA
          Stay with the kid, Happy.
          The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs
          on his horse. Looks back to the boy -- now he Ia tender:

                         JAKE
          I'll get your father back. Bastard still
          owes me fifty dollars.
          The hint of a SMIRK... long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK.
          Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount Â»p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE
          WAR PARTY. Jake meets eyes with GREY WOLF:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          You'll be ready?
          Grey Wolf NODS. Some part of the PLAN we have yet to learn.
          And now Jake starts to trot off, Ella beside him. This plays
          just between the two of them:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         ELLA
          That's a nice thing... what you said to
          the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say
          you got yourself a sweet side.
          She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:

                         JAKE
          There's nothin' sweet about me. I told
          that kid what he needed to hear so he
          wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care
          about is killin' that thing.
          And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:

                         ELLA
          I don't believe that.

                         JAKE
          Well believe it. I was playing a part.
          (straight at her)
          Just like you were.
          He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally
          follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS:

          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - CONTINUOUS


          JAKE, ELLA, COLORADO, DOC AND THE APACHE WARRIORS RIDE LIKE HELL

          TOWARD THEIR FATE, SLAMMING RIGHT INTO LENS -- AND WE MATCH TO:

          EXT. DOLARHYDE'S RANCH - DAY

          THUNDERING HOOVES -- but it's DOLARHYDE on his horse. REARS
          near the SERVANTS QUARTERS -- moving FAST toward a small hut:
          A HATCHET is embedded in a wood pile. Dolarhyde YANKS it out.

          INT. SERVANTS' QUARTERS - DAY

          The APACHE WOMAN we saw in the drawn-and-quartered scene earlier
          is washing clothes on a basin board. She turns as --
          Dolarhyde ENTERS. A menacing figure with a blade in the
          doorway. She stands, ALERT -- in SUBTITLED APACHE:

          THE WOMAN (SUBTITLE)
          What are you doing?
          Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the
          FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar
          REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill
          out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman:

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          Need it to save Nat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now:

                         THE WOMAN
          Is he okay?

                         DOLARHYDE
          He's gonna be.
          A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde
          veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to
          him... and TOUCHES his face.
          And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S
          MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          I won't let anything happen to him,
          Jenny.

                         THE WOMAN

                         (SOFTLY)
          Come back to me.
          With that, he's GONE with the gold. Leaving her full of DREAD.

          EXT. TWIN RIVER FALLS - CAVERN ENTRANCE - DAY

          A CASCADING WATERFALL flows over rock face into the TWIN RIVERS.
          The water curtain covers a CAVERN ENTRANCE. The back way in.
          Jake, Ella, Doc, Colorado and the Apaches cross slippery rocks
          and push through the water...

          INT. LIMESTONE CAVERN - CONTINUOUS

          Behind the curtain, they shake off the wet and remove TORCHES
          from waterproof buffalo-hide pouches. FIRELIGHT as our team
          creeps along in a column. TENSE. Jake glances at Colorado:

          You and Percy're brothers, huh?

          So... your momma and Dolarhyde---

                         NAT COLORADO
          We friends now? Last I checked, you shot
          my ear off.

                         JAKE
          (a beat; then)
          Want it back?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Colorado GRUMBLES, pushes ahead of Jake...

          EXT. FORT HUACHUCA - MORNING

          A BUZZARD picks at the EAR of a DEAD GANG MEMBER. More birds
          scavenge the dismembered remains of JAKE'S CREW as the rest of
          its LIVING MEMBERS -- roughly 30 -- tend wounds and get ready to
          move on. One of them looks up...
          .. and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon:

                         OUTLAW

          BRONC!
          BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of
          the gang... until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As
          he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE:

                         HUNT
          One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with!
          Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns

                         BRONC
          The hell you want?

                         DOLARHYDE
          It's about what you want.
          He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Lonergan stole your gold. That's a taste
          of what I got -- more'n you've ever seen.
          It's all yours if you help me get my boy
          back.
          The men trade LOOKS. Bronc eyes the coin. Alight with greed:

                         BRONC
          Who's got your boy?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Well, there's the rub.

                         (BEAT)
          I got two.

          Our team has travelled far into the bowels of the cavern. Jake
          STOPS, torchlight reflecting the GOLD in the cavern walls.
          Doc cracks off a piece. POCKETS it. Shrugs:

          They SNEAK on down the narrow shaft til they're funneled into...

          THE WATER GROTTO
          Where our TOWNSPEOPLE were hanging. Now, GONE. Around the
          corner, the sound of ENGINES POWERING UP...
          A TRANSPORT. A dozen WORKER-BEE ALIENS try to corral the HORSES
          from the pen -- cruelly jabbing the animals with ALIEN CATTLE
          PRODS. The mares REAR and WHINNY.

                         JAKE
          We're never gonna get close to that ship.
          Silently. a DRIPPING. GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER
          behind them. Swaying like a COBRA ready to strike:
          Our people TURN... the TUBE ALIEN snatches one of the Apaches,
          SWALLOWING HIM in its thorny snout! The indian SCREAMS --

                         JAKE
          Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM! It
          KEENS, BURNING, SPITTING OUT the Apache. ALERTED, the dozen
          aliens by the transport SWARM at our heroes!

                         NAT COLORADO
          C g_that shuttle.
          Colorado readies his TOMAHAWK -- Jake meets his eyes:

                         JAKE
          Knew there was a good reason I didn't
          kill you.

                         NAT COLORADO
          Just thinkin' the same thing.
          The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS... then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at
          the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM! Aliens TWIST and SCREAM --
          The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER
          and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS.
          The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern --
          And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run,
          for the transport -- up the loading ramp:

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - MINI CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

          Ella SLAMS a switch and the ramp DRAWS UP. Jake FREEZES:
          COCOONS hang all around, filled with motionless HUMAN BEINGS.

          JAKE.
          She slaps open an ENGINEERING HATCH, drops down a LADDER. He
          takes a last awful look and SLIDES down after her --

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

          -- the ladder funnels into the COCKPIT. Ella starts TAPPING the
          console and HOLO-DISPLAYS appear, Alien text, rotating
          graphics. She slides into a SEAT --

                         ELLA
          Strap in. dammit!!!

                         JAKE
          Into what?!?
          Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES. JAKE grabs
          WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the
          sensation of ELLQU as:

          INT. CAVERN TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

          Ella pilots the ship UPWARD, thrusters belching a WAKE OF FIRE
          that SCORCHES cavern walls and INCINERATES 6 ALIENS!
          As a HORSE streaks by, Colorado grabs a hunk of mane, LEAPS ON --

          LET'S GO!!!
          DOC comes RUNNING frantically:

                         DOC

          DON'T LEAVE ME!!!
          Colorado PULLS Doc up onto the horse's bare back -- no easy task
          with Doc's 300 POUNDS. The remaining Apaches (5) commandeer
          horses and GALLOP HARD down the tunnel --
          Two aliens jump on MANTA-SPEEDERS in pursuit!

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - DAY


          THE TRANSPORT SHUTTLE KAMIKAZES THROUGH BI-SECTING TUNNELS:
          Jake has NEVER moved this fast, BARELY avoiding walls as Ella
          expertly pilots the ship. LEFT -- RIGHT -- SIDEWAYS -- up
          ahead, DIM LIGHT spills from a FISSURE leading above ground:

                         ELLA
          Hold on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          She cranks back and the ship PITCHES upward --

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - OVER THE CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle BURSTS OUT into the canyon and skates the rim. Jake
          fights the G-FORCES and teeth-rattling TURBULENCE as --
          The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD.
          As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us:

          EXT. UPPER CLOUD LAYER - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal...

          THE ALIEN SCOUT
          -SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye
          of a hurricane.
          ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE.
          Trying to find a word to DESCRIBE this thing. Finally:

                         JAKE
          Sheee-it.

          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

          The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing
          tunnels -- KA-CHINNNG! Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS
          and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind!
          Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they:

          INT. ALIEN FORT - CANYON - CONTINUOUS

          GALLOP Out into daylight, rigb-t_through the CENTER of the fort --
          Doc THROWS his molotov and BOOM!!! Aliens go FLYING, on fire!
          Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE
          HARD for the fort's 30 FT. STEEL ENTRY GATES... which start
           SWINGING CLOSED to trap them!
          But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow
          opening as it THUNDERS CLOSED. Now the aliens are pissed off:

          EXT. ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS

          They start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit. A few mount
          SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH:

          ,INT. CANYON TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

          Colorado and Doc ZIG-ZAG around CURVES -- like mice navigatinga
          maze, so the speeders can't get a clear shot:

                         DOC
          They're gaining on us!

                         NAT COLORADO
          That's the point!
          And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS...
          BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN
          from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade
          CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING!
          A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES
          RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH!
          An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking
          WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY!
          The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets
          it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO
          FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING:

                         EMMETT

          YEAHHHHH!!!

                         THE ALIENS
          Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE
          END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP:

          GREY WOLF AND HIS 40 APACHES CHARGE IN. A MOVING HUMAN WALL
          CRASH! The Apaches HURTLE into the flank of aliens. LASERS are
          met with the CRACK of RIFLES and hatchets --

          TAKE THE FORT! ! !
          The Apache leader spurs his horse onward, leading men toward the
          alien bunker. An EXPLOSION CONSUMES FRAME, becoming the:

          EXT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - ABOVE THE CLOUDS - CONTINUOUS

          -- PLASMA FIRE of the shuttle's burners as it ROARS toward the
          ALIEN SHIP... a SPECK against the BEHEMOTH:

          INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          The shuttle sweeps past the command center's polarized window,
          where... THE SLAVER watches with EVIL EYES.
          He's on the UPPER LEVEL of a TWO-TIER COMMAND CENTER. A DOZEN
          ALIENS operate holo-consoles. Readying the ship to leave.

          INT. TRANSPORT SHUTTLE - SAME

          Ella settles down on a GLOWING DOCKING COLLAR. With the two
          ships CONNECTED, the DISPLAY flashes a DEPARTURE ALERT:

          They quickly CLIMB up the LADDER TUBE --

                         ELLA
          Engines are warming up -- got eight
          minutes til the ship leaves, and about
          one til automated retrieval --

          -- autojamated what --?

          INT. SHUTTLE - LOADING BAY - CONTINUOUS

          As they spill into the LOADING BAY, a CLANG reverberates:
          THE AIRLOCK DOOR -- AT THEIRFEyT
          The first EXPLOSIVE BOLT shoots off. Ella jams her SHOTGUN into
          a sheath on her back, presses herself flat:

                         ELLA
          Hug the wall.
          Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          When they come at us, aim for their
          heads. Only way to kill 'em for sure.
          He looks at his bracelet, adrenaline SURGING -- it ACTIVATES:

                         JAKE
          I'll aim just fine.
          THE LAST BOLT FIRES and the airlock door SHOOTS OFF:

          A MULTI- D HYDRAULIC "GRABBER" RISES INTO THE MECHANICAL

          LIMBS SWINGING AROUND INCHES FROM THEIR FACES!

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          SonofaBITCH!
          The manipulator arms SCOOP UP COCOONS, pulling them DOWN the

                         AIRLOCK:

                         ELLA

          C'MON!
          She JUMPS through the airlock -- Jake has no time to think:

                         DAMMIT --
          And JUMPS after her --

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - "THE FARM" - CONTINUOUS

          -- LANDING beside Ella. Starts to pick himself up... but what
          he sees ASSAULTS HIS MIND. We RISE UP UP UP, Ella and Jake
          growing SMALLER in what we now reveal is a MASSIVE HANGAR where:
          AUTOMATED -ARMS PLANT RECENT ARRIVALS INTO A VERITABLE FOREST of
          PEOPLE AND ANIMALS. Level after level, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS
          OF COCOONS are suspended from branch-like limbs.
          Jake picks himself up, looking around the massive hangar in AWE.

                         ELLA

                         Ï¿½CIDYAPLQLWJJ
          -- she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS
          overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons
          like the machine in the underground cave. As they CROUCH:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          We can't let that thing see us or they'll
          know we're here.
          She turns -- hits buttons on a console -- a door SLIDES UP
          leading to a series of CORRIDORS. She starts to MOVE --

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          This'll take us to the bridge --
          But Jake doesn't follow. STARES at her --

                         JAKE
          Slaver's up there--?

                         ELLA
          I sure as hell hope not.

                         JAKE
          Then I'm not goin' with you.
          And now she HARDENS --

                         ELLA
          You got any idea how big this ship is?
          No ray you'll ever find him alone. Be
          like findin' a needle in a--
          -- SLAM!! Jake interrupts her by aiming at the LASER SCANNER
          and FIRING HIS BLASTER, blowing it apart. The scanner eye
          CRASHES to the floor, flaming. A KLAXON rings --

                         JAKE
          I ain't gonna find him. He's gonna find
          me.

                         ELLA'S FURIOUS:

                         ELLA
          Thanks for the head start.
          She turns and RUNS. Jake moves to that scanner eye on the
          floor, walks right up to it and STARES into the shattered IRIS:

                         JAKE
          Alright, you sonofabitch... come and get
          me.

          INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          JAKE'S FACE APPEARS AS A THERMAL HEAT SOURCE -- fritzing as he
          stares into the scanner. ALARMS scream.
          THE SLAVER fills with RAGE. And RECOGNITION.
          Aliens begin grabbing WEAPONS but The Slaver SHRIEKS for them to
          STOP. We don't need to speak alien to understand:
          "He's mine. "

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

          Jake has moved out into the corridors -- blaster ready -- eyes
          darting -- suddenly -- WHAM:
          A STEEL BARRICADE SLAMS DOWN BEHIND HIM. WHAM! Another in
          front -- WHAM! He's TRAPPED, shut off from the passageways...
          .. except ONE. A long, dark tunnel. A DOOR at the far end
          HISSES open: THE TURBOLIFT ELEVATOR.

                         (QUIETLY; HARD)
          Okay.
          And starts walking to the elevator... as a SCREAM takes us to:

          to SCALE the wall, but are BLOWN BACK by ALIEN PARAPET SENTRIES.
          ON DOC -- running TRIAGE on wounded warriors:

          I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and
          splint that leg!

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          We're losing ranks ! ! !
           And then, out of nowhere... the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols
          fills the air as --
          DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG! A renewed SURGE of energy
          as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks:

                         NAT COLORADO
          You came back!

                         DOLARHYDE
          Told you: I take care of my kin.
          Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever
          get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as:
          A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits
          open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces
          hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming:
          THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to
          life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction.
          CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One
          LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS:

                         GANG MEMBER

          HELP ME!!! GET IT OFF!
          A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM!

          SEARING WHITE LIGHT TURNS THE OFFICER TOAASH -- AN ALIEN
          GRENADE! Doc goes FLYING from the kickback, landing near:
          GREY WOLF -- FWWWWTWHCK!!! Another claw-ball CLAMPS into the
          Apache's SHOULDER -- he SHOUTS, struggles to pull it out --

                         DOC

          DON'T. STOP, DAMMIT!!!!
          The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER
          RETJff&H_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP. Now he's stopped it from
          exploding, but if he pulls his finger out... HE DIES TOO.
          DOC and GREY WOLF lock eyes. Their fates suddenly ENTWINED as --

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - TURBOLIFT - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

          Bars of light move rhythmically across Jake's face -- BURNING
          with determination -- as he travels up in the turbolift. It
          slows to a STOP. The door cycles open and --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          -- the STRANGEST THING happens. DESERT SAND billows in a gust
          of ventilated air. SAND?! Jake emerges, blocking his eyes:

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - JUNKPILE CARGO HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

          -- the sand swirls and eddies. Visibility reduced to ZERO. As
          Jake pushes through, the air clears a little...
          His eyes WIDEN. Trying to make SENSE of what he sees:
          Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the
          tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they
          found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"? It-'-s all-HE
          in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front
          facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED
          AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up
          along with it all.
          A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage.
          Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting
          fragments of a HORSE CORRAL. A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like
          a pendulum, CLANKS EERILY.
          A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM. Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons...
          5 ALIENS emerge. Slowly. Fanning out, taking positions as...
          THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake. aAd_h@--
          is holding ELLA hostage. WRIST BLASTER pressed to her throat.
          Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
          His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready.

                         JAKE
          Drop the woman. We both know this ain't
          about her.
          But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck.
          Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          She says you're as bad as they come.
          Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say
          the same about me.
          A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Could'a had your boys kill me five times
          over, instead you rolled out the red
          carpet... so let's get it over with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          The Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge. PUSHES Ella roughly
          off to one of his GANG, who keeps a blaster pressed to her side.
          Vow ' O right the a ter of the "town" junkpile.
          THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching.
          JAKE -- his hand is still.

          A PIPE SPRAYS STEAM AGAIN, SCREAMINGLY LOUD AND --
          Everyone DRAWS! But Jake's INSANELY FAST as he drops to a knee
          and FIRES gunsmoke-style -- BLAM SLAM! The Slaver's HIT and --
          ELLA -- WRENCHES her captor's arm backward and he fires USELESS
          ROUNDS into the air -- she takes a HIT in the leg as Jake SHOOTS
          the captor with a SHOT to the temple --
          Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE
          FRONT, taking cover -- lasers PUNCHING through the building
          walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner:

                         ELLA

          BEHIND YOU!!!
          Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.

                         JAKE
          Stay down.
          Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS

          THEM ALL DOWN WITH PERFECT AIM.
          The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a
          turbine HOWL.
          Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail
          of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner...
          Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded --

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          -- you alright?
          In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien:

                         ELLA
          Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship
          on the ground soon, we're all dead...
          (tries to STAND, WINCES)
          Get me over to that turbolift.
          He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her
          to the elevator --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          Put me inside.
          He does. She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          I can manage the rest without you.
          (tough... but with

                         COMPASSION)
          Go do what you came up here to do.
          He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR.
          And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:

                         JAKE
          Goddamnit.
          -- he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her. She SLAMS the control
          pad, doors CLOSE -- they start rocketing upward. She half-grins
          as her eyes hold on him. And within them... trust. AND FAITH.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Stop smiling.

          EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD - OUTSIDE ALIEN FORT - CONTINUOUS

          As the FORT SIEGE continues, DOLARHYDE and COLORADO gallop back
          and forth between their men:

                         DOLARHYDE

          DON'T BREAK RANKS! HOLD YOUR LINES

          GODDAMIT! WE CAN TAKE THIS FOR--
          -- KATHWAM! An EXPLOSION throws them off their horses.
          Colorado picks up his father and they start RUNNING LOW under
          stray beams of PLASMA FIRE, reaching Doc and Grey Wolf:

          THE FOUR MEN -- PINNED BEHIND THE ROCK EMBANKMENT:
          Doc's finger is still STUCK in that ALIEN GRENADE, clamped to
          the bleeding Apache's shoulder:

          DOL.ARHYDE (CONT'D)
          The hell iz that?
          Grey Wolf MOANS in pain. Doc SHOUTS to Dolar:

                         DOC
          Tell him to hold still! If I have this
          thing figured right, long as t keep my
          finger under the red pin we won't blow
          up!

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
          What's he saying?:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
          He says we're all gonna die.

                         COLORADO
          We need to pull it out of his shoulder!

                         DOLARHYDE
          I'm not pullin' anything!

                         (RE: DOC)
          He's the damn doctor!
          ZZZZZZAM! MORE people are CUT DOWN by the Alien GRENADE CANNON
          -- the BLOWBACK nearly KNOCKS the grenade out of Doe's hand --

                         DOC

          SHIT!
          Dolarhyde gets an IDEA. HARDENS. Looks Doc right in the eye:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Alright, listen -- you slide your finger
          from under that pin, I'll slip mine in
          and hold it in place. Then you pull it
          out and I'll throw it.
          Doc NODS fearfully. Dolar carefully SLIPS his finger under the
          pin as Doc SLIPS it out. PHEW. Now Doc takes hold of the
          grenade itself, nods "ready" to pull it out. Grey Wolf braces

                         FOR PAIN:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Tell your wife we're clear.

                         DOC
          What?

                         DOLARHYDE
          -- your wife. Maria. We had an
          arrangement. I left your saloon alone
          and she paid me off.
          ON DOC. Reeling, now REALLY confused --

                         DOC
          We're broke. Paid you off with what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         DOLARHYDE
          She stole from the people in your morgue.
          Gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches --
          It LANDS on Doc: that's why he fond the watch under their bed.

                         DOC
          I thought she was cheating!

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just robbin' corpses.

                         DOC
          Thank God!
          (and then -- )
          Wait. You hate me. Why're you telling
          me this?
          With GENUINE REMORSE:

                         DOLARHYDE
          May not get another chance --

                         (THEN)
          -- and I still hate ya.
          A MOMENT. Forgiveness and atonement.

          GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)

          WILL YOU GET ON WITH IT?111

          DOC AND DOLARHYDE
          One... two... three!
          And Doc RIPS the grenade from Grey Wolf's shoulder -- he HOWLS,
          CLAMPS tearing out of his flesh. But they did it!
          As more EXPLOSIONS decimate men, Dolarhyde PULLS the grenade out
          of Doc's hands, still holding his finger under the FIRING PIN --

                         DOC

                         WHAT'RE YOU--
          Dolarhyde looks at Colorado:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Tell your mother I love her.
          With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos

                         NAT COLORADO

          WAIT!
          -- but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through
          the debris, he sees his father running toward...

                         THE SUPERCANNON

          Dolarhyde HURLS the grenade -- BOOM!!! IT DETONATES IN A

          MILLION PIECES! DOLARHYDE DISAPPEARS IN THE BLAST!

          A CRY OF VICTORY as the humans STORM THROUGH! Aliens hurtle
          back in DISORDER --

          INT. SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

          The small ALIEN BRIDGE CREW scrambles to control the damaged
          ship. The WHIR of the lift arriving, doors OPEN and --
          WHOOSH! The SMART WEAPON blurs out of the elevator, SLICING
          HALF A DOZEN ALIENS IN HALF -- circles back around to ELLA, who
          skillfully catches it as she RUN/LIMPS from the lift with JAKE --
          LASER FIRE IGNITES THE BRIDGE as he makes QUICK WORK of the rest
          and Ella mans a console, getting to work --

                         ELLA
          We're going down fast.
          She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The
          BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way:
          A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives... AND THE SLAVER STEPS
          QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella:

                         JAKE
          No matter what.
          Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a
          catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below.
          Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into
          the water. PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm -- CRUSHING IT.
          Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH
          MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK
          CODE -- and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E.
          The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP
          -- WHUP-SNAP! The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his
          shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK!
          Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY --

          The Scout Ship SCREAMS down out of the cloud, toward the CANYON:

          A MONSTROUS SHADOW spreads over the battlefield. Everyone looks
          up to see the SCOUT SHIP PLUMMETING DOWN --

          Another LASER WHIP SNAP and Jake seems DONE. Now The Slaver
          LIFTS Jake from the water, CRUSHING his wind-pipe.
          Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME... finally GRABS
          and STABS it into The Slaver's side. The Alien ROARS in pain
          and looks down to see --

          ONE OF HIS OWN "ICE TACKS" FROM HIS BANDOLIER EMBEDDED IN HIS

          SIDE. IT STARTS TO GLOW BLUE WITH A HIGH-PITCH WHINE:

                         JAKE
          Go to hell.

          THE SLAVER'S ROAR OF DEFEAT IS CUT SHORT AS THE MOTHERFUCKER

          FREEZES TO GREY STONE. EXPLODING IN A MILLION PIECES!!!

          Jake FALLS into the seat beside Ella, straps in. Fighting the
          controls, she SEES THE WHIP MARKS on his back. It TEARS her
          heart open. And because this might be the end... she ADMITS:

                         ELLA
          I lied.

                         JAKE
          ... I know.

                         ELLA
          No, I heard what you said when I was
          layin' there...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          JAKE. Taken aback. LAID BARE. As she says:

                         ELLA (CONT'D)
          You are a good man. At least... to me.
          The ground GROWS BIGGER out the window. Her HAND reaches over
          for his. JAKE'S HAND clasps hers and --

          EXT. BADLANDS - THE BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS


          THE SHIP PLUNGES INTO THE CANYON AND CLEAR THROUGH THE ALIEN

          FORT, RIPPING IT INTO TIDAL-WAVE MOUNDS OF SHRAPNEL... CHEWS UP

          A HALF-MILE BEFORE SLOWLY COMING TO A FINAL, WRENCHING... STOP.
          The frame is WHITE with dust and SUNSHINE. As from the ether
          comes...
          EMMETT, HAPPY, and DOC, with GREY WOLF's arm slung over his
          shoulder. Among other faces, White and Apache... all of them
          PROUD WARRIORS. Staring in awe at:

          THE CRASHED ALIEN SHIP. DUG DEEP INTO THE CANYON FLOOR.
          Something starts to rain down. Looks at first like glitter...
          until we realize it's GOLD DUST.
          From an OPENING in the Scout Ship, the sound of THUNDERING
          HOOVES as... ALL THE ANIMALS STAMPEDE OUT. Then, slowly...
          HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE emerge, dazed -- their minds slowly WAKING
          UP. White and Kiowa-Apache ABDUCTEES.
          DOC RUSHES IN, searching faces -- no -- no -- no -- n--
          THERE she is, his BELOVED MARIA, stumbling weakly toward him as
          tears runs down her cheek. He EMBRACES her madly, kissing every
          inch of her face as...
          EMMETT pushes through the crowd, sees SHERIFF TAGGART --

                         EMMETT

          PAW!!!! PAW!!!!
          The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart
          stares back in a daze --

                         EMMETT (CONT'D)
          It's me -- it's Emmett.
          And somewhere in there, RECOGNITION comes to the Sheriff's
          eyes... Emmett SMILES and throws his arms around his father
          again as --

          THE TOWNSFOLK OF ABSOLUTION AND THE APACHES FIND EACH OTHER.
          Families, lovers, friends... reunited.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         COLORADO
          Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of
          Dolarhyde, his FATHER. Eyes welling, he drops to his knees...

          A VOICE (O.S.)
          Nat?
          Colorado turns -- it's PERCY. Confused. Like waking from a
          dream. Sees his father on the ground...

                         PERCY
          What... happened?
          And all Colorado can say is...

                         NAT COLORADO
          He's dead.
          That HANGS there. Percy blinks. And then --

                         PERCY
          Who's gettin' the ranch?
          ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE
          BLIND RAGE takes hold and his FISTS FLY, PUNCHING PERCY:

          NAT COLORADO PERCY

          YOU SONOFABITCH! HE JUST STOP! NAT, STOP!!!

          SAVED YOUR WORTHLESS LITTLE

          LIFE!

          DOLARHYDE (O.S.)

          HEY!
          Colorado WHIRLS -- DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          No one's gettin' my ranch.
          Stunned, Colorado GRINS. Percy spits blood, points accusingly --

                         PERCY
          Paw, he--
          Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face:

                         PERCY (CONT'D)
          OW!!! What'd you do that for?

                         UOLARHYUE
          For being an ungrateful little bastard.
          Now shake your brother's hand and thank
          him for saving your ass, cause it's more
          than you ever would'a done bjM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          Chastened, Percy glowers at Colorado. Grudgingly reaches out a
          hand. So does Nat. As they SHAKE --

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          That's better.

                         JAKE
          Staggers through the crowd. And sees ELLA. Thgy did it. But
          she still looks TROUBLED. Staring out at the vast desert...

                         JAKE
          . what is it?

                         ELLA
          We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft.
          That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon.
          HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note...
          We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until
          Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd...

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. TOWN OF ABSOLUTION - DAY

          A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that
          GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE.
          We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two
          APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride
          in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          EMMETT! GET OVER HERE!!!

                         EMMETT
          -- what? What'd I dQ?

          SHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT
          Get outta the road before
          you're run down! If your (overlapping)
          momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the
          street she'd roll over in her
          grave and shoot lightnin'
          bolts outta her eyes," I know,
          I know!
          He runs off. Taggart SMIRKS:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Kid's got a mouth on him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         DEPUTY WADE
          Well, Kyle, considering he saved your
          life, guess you'll just have to grin'n
          bear it.
          Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Woodrow.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Kyle.
          Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:

                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
          Go_ _on.
          Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's this?

                         DOLARHYDE
          Claims to the land 50 miles west of here.
          I've signed it over to the township of
          Absolution.
          (off Taggart's LOOK)
          Considering I'm a businessman, I figure
          expansion's in both our interests. Needs
          the Sheriff's signature to be official.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Fifty miles west of here is where the
          goldmine is, Woodrow.

                         DOLARHYDE

                         (A BEAT)
          That so.
          With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          What's this about twenty percent going to
          the Apaches?
          Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened
          rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:

                         DOLARHYDE
          Figure the only way not to piss 'em off
          is to buy 'em.

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          Since when'd you worry about pissin'
          anyone off?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Just sign it, Goddamnit.
          With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
          flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:

                         SHERIFF TAGGART
          I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow,
          but I know you'd just be insulted.

                         DOLARHYDE
          Damn right.
          Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE
          UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of
          being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:

          INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each
          other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck:

                         DOC MARIA
          SHH! The workers will hear
          us!!! Let them hear!
          As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under
          his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.

                         DOC
          What is this?

                         MARIA
          Look at the inscription.
          He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR
          SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:

                         DOC
          This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...

                         MARIA
          Shut up and kiss me.
          She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME --

          EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

          A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle
          bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for
          Jake to FOLLOW. He GRINS. As MUSIC begins to RISE -- HOPEFUL:

          EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

          In a LONG SHOT -- the distant SILHOUETTES of Happy BOUNDING
          through the shallow TWIN RIVERS, Jake following on horseback...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          EXT. RIM OF CANYON - DAY

          As Jake approaches, APACHE SENTRIES emerge from rocks to keep
          outsiders away. Jake TIPS his hat and they nod, let him pass.
          He nears the bluff where ELLA, GREY WOLF, and the rest of the
          Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into
          the canyon. Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog
          with Jake. She smiles as he rides up, dismounts:

                         ELLA
          Second damn time that dog ran off on me.

                         JAKE
          Second time he brought me to you.
          Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And
          it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it --
          glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite,
          and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Looks like you got everything set.
          Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly

                         DISAPPOINTED:

                         ELLA
          Where you headed?

                         JAKE

                         (A BEAT)
          Got some messes to clean up.
          But she looks at him. fEADI.NG liim. wryly:

                         ELLA
          Messes.

                         JAKE
          ... Yep.
          (then; off her look)
          What.
          She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:

                         ELLA
          I think you're ridin' off cause you're
          just scared of what'll happen if you
          stay.
          An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his
          horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:

                         JAKE
          And what's gonna happen?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          She steps CLOSER to him... INTIMATE:

                         ELLA
          You know.
          A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS...
          But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't
          quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:

                         JAKE
          If I stay... it's not gonna be good for
          anybody, Ella.
          A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he
          slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:

                         ELLA
          Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird
          noises at night. Cattle mutilations.
          Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down
          there. Give it a look-see.

                         JAKE
          (his eyes narrow)
          What's 'phenomena'?

                         ELLA
          Big storms in places that don't get big
          storms.
          ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
          though he plays it down:

                         JAKE
          You goin' down there yourself?

                         ELLA
          Why? You worried about me?
          You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--

                         JAKE
          No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself
          just fine.
          (then; tips his hat)
          Be seein' you around.

                         ELLA
          goodbye, Jake.
          He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and
          trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't
          be an idiot." Jake glances over --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         JAKE
          Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.

          (BARK, BARK)
          Go on, GET.
          He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
          Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his
          chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...
          But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.
          TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap
          between them.
          Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best
          effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Abilene happens to be on my way.
          He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO
          THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
          around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
          Stop smiling, Goddammit.
          He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye
          look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT:
          The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the
          canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF
          DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE:
          ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The
          THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...

          THE TWIN RIVERS GEYSERING UP INTO THE CANYON. COVERING ALL

          EVIDENCE OF THE ALIEN SHIP AND 'Q T.
          Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a
          nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI
