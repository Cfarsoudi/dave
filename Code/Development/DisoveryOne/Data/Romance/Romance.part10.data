          1. THE CHILD
          Gradually more and more visible in the darkness, the face
          of a child, Sam. He is 6 years old, blond, pale and
          miserably thin. As we move in on his eyes, we see his lids
          quickly contracting.
          Under his eyelids: vestiges of the day's lights and
          shadows, of the day's noise.

          2. EXT. - NORTHWEST LANDSCAPES. DAY

          A grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can
          knock a man off his feet.
          On the side of the highway, a large, muscular man with
          spiked blond hair: Ali Van Versh, 25.
          He has a big bag in one hand and a cell phone in the other.
          He talks on the phone as he continues walking:

                         ALI
          It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid
          with me. She can't take care of him anymore.
          I got into a fight with the guy she's with.
          I don't know where to go. What do I do with
          the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more
          credit... Call me back!
          He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam.

                         ALI
          Move it!
          His phone rings. He immediately answers.

                         ALI
          Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do
          I get there? I don't know. Today or
          tomorrow. Yeah...
          Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny,
          he looks like a squirrel on his father's back.

                         2

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3. INT. TRAIN.DAY

          There is a map of the French rail system near the toilets
          in a regional train. While Sam pees, Ali examines it. He
          follows the lines to plot out their trip. He arrives where
          France ends, at the Mediterranean. Sam comes out of the
          bathroom, straightening his pants.

                         SAM
          I'm thirsty.

                         ALI
          We don't have any money.

                         SAM
          I'm thirsty!

          4. INT. TGV. DAY

          A different speed, different countryside.
          Ali notices a half-empty bottle of Evian water left on a
          tray. He takes it. He searches through the garbage under
          other empty seats.
          Ali and Sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit, and finish
          off abandoned bottles of water.

          5. INT. TGV. DAY

          Another TGV. Rain evaporates off the windows. Ali has
          fallen asleep. He's too big for his seat. Sam watches the
          landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat. Ali
          opens one eye.

                         ALI
          Stop it.
          Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their
          banging.

                         ALI
          I said to stop it.
          The sandals freeze.
          Cut.

                         3

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6. THE CHILD
          All of a sudden, Sam is asleep, his eyelids blinking
          quickly.

          7. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY

          Ali's face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon
          sun.
          Ali and Sam look at the sea, the beaches and hotels. It's
          hot and beautiful. They walk by tanned people in shorts,
          short skirts, sandals...
          In their shapeless grey track pants, they look like hoboes.
          Ali drags his sport bag with one hand and Sam with the
          other.
          Ali is on the phone:

                         ALI
          I don't know. A big street that started at
          the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We
          just came from there!
          Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to
          the beach...

                         SAM
          I'm tired.

                         ALI
          So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on!
          Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder.

          8. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY

          A four-lane avenue near the outskirts of town.
          Ali is walking on the shoulder of the road, with Sam piggy-
          back. A horn beeps. A refrigerated truck, blinking to get
          to the side of the road. The window rolls down to reveal a
          moustache and a cap: Richard.

                         4

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9. INT. RICHARD'S TRUCK. DAY

          While driving...

                         RICHARD
          (Southern accent)... A couple miles back I
          saw a blond guy. (Imitates screeching
          brakes) I stop short! "You Ali?" I ask. He
          says "No, me Kurt". Another few hundred
          feet, another big blond guy! (Screech) I
          ask "You Ali?" again. This time I didn't
          even understand what he answered. Another
          few hundred feet... Ten of them! Ten! Every
          Kraut and Flemish guy on the coast! So I go
          call your sister...
          Ali is thrown for a loop.

                         ALI
          (uncertain) You kidding?

                         RICHARD
          A little.

                         SAM
          (to Ali) Is he a little crazy?

                         RICHARD
          (to Sam) What? You don't like my truck?

                         SAM
          Yeah I do.

                         RICHARD
          (pretending to be shocked) He doesn't like
          my truck!

                         SAM
          I do too like it!
          Worked up, Sam shrieks, holding his hands over his ears:

                         SAM
          (screaming) I like your truck!
          The road hugs the seashore. Ali watches beaches, homes, a
          railway line pass by... Voice over, we hear Richard's

                         5

                         

                         

                         

                         
          distant voice.

          10. EXT. SUBURBAN KITCHEN. DAY

          A kitchen with mismatched furnishings. China and cheesy
          wallpaper. Sam devours the cookies and Coke that Richard
          gives him.

                         RICHARD
          We all got fired after some Spanish guy
          bought out the trucking company... Eight
          truckers. I thought it over, discussed it
          with your sister and figured I could do it
          on my own. So I bought this truck with my
          severance pay...
          Ali has finished his cream cheese sandwiches. He gets up
          and opens the old fridge.

                         RICHARD
          Oops, poor man, not those! She'll kill you!
          Start with the expired ones, on the top
          shelf! They're organized by date. First the
          top shelf, then move down.... Anna brings it
          home from the supermarket where she works.
          As soon as they reach their expiration date,
          those idiots throw it all away, even if you
          can still eat it for a week! (to Sam) You
          want some more?

          11. INT. SUBURBAN HOME. DAY

          Anna empties Sam's Spiderman bag onto the table, spilling
          out old, dirty, crumpled clothes.

                         ANNA
          (with a hint of Southern accent) Is this all
          you have for him?
          Anna Van Versh, Ali's sister, is in her thirties. She is a
          huge woman, very tall with a pretty face. She wears
          leggings that make her ass look like a workhorse's and a
          pair of flip flops. At the bottom of the bag, Anna finds a
          passport and opens it. It is Sam's.

                         6

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ANNA
          She remembered his passport!

                         ALI
          She didn't remember anything. It was already
          in there. She forgot about it, that's all.
          When they went to Amsterdam, they'd use the
          kid to smuggle dope...

                         ANNA
          You got to be kidding!

                         ALI
          That's what she told me.
          Anna shakes her head in disbelief. A beat.

                         ANNA
          How will you tend to the kid? I won't be
          able to all the time. I work, and so does
          Richard... Was he in school there?

                         ALI
          I don't know.

                         ANNA
          You don't know if your kid's in school?

                         ALI
          Um, no. (turns to Sam) You in school?
          No answer. Sam is watching TV.

                         ANNA
          Back at your mom's place, did you go to
          school?

                         SAM
          Yes.

                         ANNA
          I can try to enroll him at the school. I'll
          see... We also need to get him some clothes.
          He can't go like that... I'll ask the
          neighbors.
          (gives the child her hand) Come with me to

                         7

                         

                         

                         

                         
          the backyard. I have to feed my babies.

          12. EXT. GARDEN. EVENING

          Evening is falling. At the back of the garden are a home-
          made pen and doghouse. Four puppies come running. Sam
          touches them through the chicken wire.

                         ANNA
          You want to pet them?
          She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh.

                         ANNA
          Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws.
          They're just babies.
          Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up.

                         ANNA
          (to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next
          month. Brings in some money. Otherwise,
          Richard and I were thinking 300 a month for
          you and the kid... That okay?

                         ALI
          Yeah.

                         ANNA
          "Yeah" what? Is that too much?

                         ALI
          It's not too much, but I don't have it. I
          had to pay for the train...

                         ANNA
          So what are you going to do?

                         ALI
          I don't know. Find a job. Whatever.

                         ANNA
          Yeah, whatever... You think there's any work
          around here? You think there's any more here
          than there? Where has that ever been the
          case? When you told me you were coming down,

                         8

                         

                         

                         

                         
          I said we couldn't afford houseguests!

                         ALI
          What should I have done with the kid? Where
          should I have gone?

                         ANNA
          I have no idea, but if you stay here you
          have to pay your share, or else go somewhere
          else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy:
          we can't! How long were you thinking of
          staying?

                         ALI
          I don't know.
          She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house,
          calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel,
          giggling in delight.
          He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to
          one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special
          50 moped, plastic junk, etc.
          Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights
          shining.

          13. INT. BASEMENT. NIGHT

          In the cluttered basement, Sam is rolled up in a sleeping
          bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the
          antique Special 50 moped by the light of a flashlight.

          14. INT. ELECTRONIC GOODS SHOP. DAY

          Ali wanders through an electronic goods shop, pretending to
          be interested in cameras. Through the shop window, he can
          see Sam waiting outside in the sun.

          15. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY

          Suddenly, Sam sees his father run out of the shop, trying
          to shake a security guard hot on his tail. Sam watches them
          disappear into a tiny lane.
          Sam looks around a bit frightened.

                         9

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Farther off, in a busy shopping districtâ¦
          Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists. The security
          guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a
          wall. They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          Unzip your jacket! Empty your pockets!
          Ali keeps his cool.

                         ALI
          Unzip it yourself!
          Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The
          guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges:
          The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right
          hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him
          flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the
          benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own
          biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off.

          16. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY

          Sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the
          terraces and ice-cream stores, looking for his father.
          Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot
          where they had left it chained up. He walks toward it. A
          voice calls out.

                         ALI
          Hey! Here I am!
          Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who
          is sniffling, tears in his eyes.

                         ALI
          No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all
          alone.
          Ali unlocks the moped.

                         10

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17. EXT. ALLEYWAY. DAY

          In a small side street, Sam watches Ali sell a camera for a
          few 20 Euro notes.

          18. EXT. ANTIBES - BEACH. DAY

          On the beach, Ali and Sam eat some McDonald's.

                         ALI
          Are you happy here?
          Sam nods.

                         SAM
          Mm.

                         ALI
          What do you like the most at Auntie's?

                         SAM
          The dogs.

                         ALI
          Is that all? Nothing else besides the dogs?

                         SAM
          The truck.

                         ALI
          The dogs and the truck. The house? Auntie?
          The ocean?

                         SAM
          The dogs and the truck.
          Ali nods. Sam watches his Dad's fat fingers assemble the
          plastic toy from his Happy Meal.

                         ALI
          We have it good here...
          Ali's fingers stop. Sam looks up to find his father
          watching some girls in swimsuits go by.
          They go for a swim, horsing around and making noise.

                         11

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19. INT. OFFICE - THE ALTA SECU COMPANY. DAY

          The logo is in the shape of a sheriff's badge and hangs
          over some filing cabinets on the wall of a modest office:
          "ALTA Securite".

                         OWNER
          No criminal record? You never fucked up?

                         ALI
          No.
          The boss is in his fifties. He sits behind some files. His
          hair is short and white, it looks like he's wearing a
          helmet. He is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie.
          He stares at Ali.

                         OWNER
          Is that the truth? We'll be checking
          anyway...
          Ali nods. The owner reaches out.

                         OWNER
          Your papers...
          Ali hands him his tattered paper ID. The owner writes down
          the number. Ali is 13-14 on the picture.

                         OWNER
          What was your last job?

                         ALI
          I worked in a slaughterhouse. Not for long.
          It closed.

                         OWNER
          Ever work in security?

                         ALI
          Yeah. I was a night watchman in a stadium
          for 6 months. Working for the city. In a
          parking lot too. I did replacements.

                         12

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         OWNER
          Ever do any combat sports?

                         ALI
          Karate, for 6 years. I even won Junior
          Division. And two years of boxing. Thai.

                         OWNER
          You gave it up?

                         ALI
          It was my trainer who gave up.

                         OWNER
          Why?

                         ALI
          He died.
          A beat.

                         OWNER
          And how are you physically? You stay in
          shape?

                         ALI
          Yeah.

                         OWNER
          You don't smoke?

                         ALI
          No.

                         OWNER
          Drink?
          He shakes his head "no". The boss notes something in a
          file.

          20. INT. ALTA SECURITY OFFICE. DAY.

          Anna and Sam are waiting outside the office. The owner
          kisses Anna on the cheek. He asks how Richard is doing,
          then shows them to the door. Anna looks proud to know him.

                         13

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21. EXT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT

          Saturday evening. The door to the Fever Ray night club.
          Patrons wait, bouncers pick and choose. An imposing
          Caucasian maneuvers the red rope. Behind him, Ali Van
          Versch and Foued Latahoui, who looks like a lightweight
          boxer, guard the door.
          Ali wears a faded blue "ALTA Secu" jacket and stiff,
          matching pants. Looking well-groomed, Foued is wearing a
          white shirt and tie. Well-groomed.
          A group of girls passes through the security barrier. Foued
          acts like he's hesitating:

                         FOUED
          Okay, I'll let you through because I'm
          outnumbered. Four against one, I don't stand
          a chance!
          The girls smile and disappear inside. Ali watches them
          vanish.

                         FOUED
          You say something nice, anything. That way,
          when they leave, they remember you and you
          can hit on them. If they're a little
          plastered, if things didn't go too well for
          them, you're there with a nice thing to
          say...

                         ALI
          And it works?

                         FOUED
          Sometimes. But you can't be dressed like
          that. Like a parking lot attendant...
          They are interrupted by the bouncer.

                         THE CAUCASIAN
          (pointing) Fight!
          They go running. Three guys are fighting like savages. Ali
          and Foued clean house. Foued gets rid of gawkers. Ali
          delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off

                         14

                         

                         

                         

                         
          his feet and grabs another by the collar.
          While Foued chases the rowdy men toward the parking lot,
          Ali helps a girl back to her feet. She's a pretty blond,
          must be about 27 or 28, who has taken a punch in the face.
          It is Stephanie.

                         ALI
          Are you okay? Breathe out of your mouth. In
          and out. Put your head back. Walk a little.
          Walk and breathe...
          He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her
          to walk. She looks groggy.

                         STEPHANIE
          I have to go home...

                         ALI
          You have friends here?

                         STEPHANIE
          No, I came alone. I have my car in the lot.
          I'll be fine.

                         ALI
          You can't drive like that.

                         STEPHANIE
          I'm fine. I'm fine, I said. Thanks.

                         ALI
          You can't drive like that. I'll call you a
          cab.

                         STEPHANIE
          How do I get my car afterwards? Seriously,
          I'll be fine. Trust me!
          We hear a voice from the parking lot.

                         ANGRY MAN
          Bitch!
          Stephanie looks back.

                         15

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ANGRY MAN
          Yeah... you, you cunt. Bitch!
          She ignores him, pretending not to see him. She then
          notices the blood stains on her T-shirt.

                         STEPHANIE
          Shit.

                         ALI
          Where's your car?

          22. INT. STEPHANIE'S CAR. NIGHT

          Ali drives. His head seems to touch the roof of the little
          Fiat and his thighs are too thick for the seat. He glances
          over at Stephanie.

                         ALI
          Still bleeding? Keep your head back. Wait...
          He manipulates the knob to push her seat back. He grimaces
          in pain.

                         ALI
          Shit!

                         STEPHANIE
          Did you hurt yourself?
          He shows her his right wrist.

                         STEPHANIE
          It's swelling up.
          He rests his hand on the wheel. After a beat:

                         ALI
          You often go to the Fever?

                         STEPHANIE
          No.

                         ALI
          Why do you go alone?
          No answer.

                         16

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          To dance?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes.

                         ALI
          To find a guy?
          She turns and looks down her nose at him:

                         STEPHANIE
          Oh yeah?

                         ALI
          You're dressed like that just for dancing?

                         STEPHANIE
          How am I dressed?

                         ALI
          I don't know... Look.
          He points to her skirt, riding up her thighs.

                         STEPHANIE
          Yeah, so what?

                         ALI
          You look like a hooker.

                         STEPHANIE
          Excuse me?

                         ALI
          How would you call it?

                         STEPHANIE
          I don't believe this. Pull over here!

                         ALI
          What?

                         STEPHANIE
          Stop this car on the double!

                         17

                         

                         

                         

                         
          No reaction.

                         STEPHANIE
          It's MY car! If I tell you to stop, you
          stop!
          Still no reaction, as if she hadn't said a thing. She is
          about to scream again, but remains silent, although open-
          mouthed. She finally settles back down on the back of her
          seat and looks elsewhere.
          A beat.

                         ALI
          Dressed like that, it's no surprise that...

                         STEPHANIE
          That's enough now!
          They ride in silence.

          23. EXT. SIMON & STEPHANIE'S BUILDING. NIGHT

          The Fiat stops in front of a small building in a flowery
          residential neighborhood. They climb out.

                         STEPHANIE
          How will you get back?

                         ALI
          I don't know.
          She takes out her wallet.

                         ALI
          No, stop!

                         STEPHANIE
          For a taxi.

                         ALI
          Don't worry. Got any ice at your place?
          He shows her his wrist.

                         ALI
          Ice cubes.

                         18

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          Wait, I'll go check.

                         ALI
          I can come up.

                         STEPHANIE
          No!
          Even she is surprised by the brusqueness of her response.

                         STEPHANIE
          (embarrassed) Someone's up there.

                         ALI
          So what?

                         STEPHANIE
          Wait here. I'll be right back.
          She takes a few steps, fumbling for her keys. She
          hesitates, then looks back.

                         STEPHANIE
          Okay, come on up.

          24. INT. SIMON & STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

          They enter the apartment. The light is on. Simon comes out
          of the bedroom in his boxer shorts and a T-shirt. He's
          thirty, blond, and there is something commanding about his
          look that could be thought to resemble Stephanie's.
          He discovers Ali and the blood stains on Stephanie's T-

                         SHIRT:

                         SIMON
          What the hell? What's going on?

                         STEPHANIE
          Nothing. A fight...

                         SIMON
          Are you okay?

                         19

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          Yeah, I'm fine.

                         SIMON
          (pointing to Ali) Who's he?

                         STEPHANIE
          The bouncer from the Fever. He drove me
          home.

                         ALI
          (introducing himself)... Ali.

                         SIMON
          The Fever? What the hell were you doing
          there?
          Ali opens the refrigerator.

                         SIMON
          What are you looking for?

                         ALI
          Ice cubes.

                         STEPHANIE
          He hurt his hand...
          Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom.
          Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl. Ali's hand in the
          bowl. He looks around.
          There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back
          of a killer whale, Stephanie posing with a group of young
          people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo,
          Stephanie rising out of the water on Niska's rostrum, etc.
          From the nearby bedroom, he hears snatches of Simon's

                         REPROACHES:

                         SIMON (OFF)
          If you decide to go out, call me. That's
          all! Who were you with there?

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          Philippe and Christine.

                         20

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SIMON (OFF)
          I thought you went out to dinner.

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          We decided to go out for a drink after.

                         SIMON (OFF)
          You get my text messages? Why didn't you
          answer me?
          Stephanie comes back into the kitchen. She has changed her
          T-shirt. She seems tense.

                         STEPHANIE
          Feeling better?

                         ALI
          Is that you in the picture with the orcas?

                         STEPHANIE
          Not orcas. Just one orca. Her name is Niska.

                         ALI
          Is that your job?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yep...
          Ali nods vaguely admiringly.

                         ALI
          Fuck... I didn't think that...

                         STEPHANIE
          That what? A whore could train whales? Well,
          you see...
          Simon is at the door. He is wearing a jean.

                         SIMON
          (To Ali) Okay, are you done now? Can you
          leave us alone?
          Ali stares him down.

                         21

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          You talking to me?
          It's as if Ali's calm, peremptory tone suddenly let Simon
          know who he was dealing with.

                         SIMON
          Yes, but...

                         ALI
          But what?

                         SIMON
          Nothing, forget it...
          In one second, Stephanie sees Simon's face undergo a
          metamorphosis, his nervous authority suddenly disappear.
          She glances at Ali as if to say âPlease go now.'
          He gets up and wipes his hands on a dish rag.

                         ALI
          Okay, I'm going. So long. (pointing to a
          piece of paper on the table) I left you my
          number if ever you need it...

          25. INT. SIMON & STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          She dissolves an aspirin in a toothbrush glass. She checks
          her lip in the medicine chest mirror. She notices Simon
          watching her from the bathroom doorway.

                         SIMON
          Are you okay? Are you upset?

                         STEPHANIE
          No, I'm not upset.
          She drinks the aspirin.

                         STEPHANIE
          I saw your face before...

                         SIMON
          Before?

                         22

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          With that guy who dropped me off. I saw your
          face. I saw how you piped down.

                         SIMON
          I piped down? Me?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes, you piped down... (pause) Don't tell me
          what I should do, how I should live my life.
          Don't give me any more orders, Simon.

                         SIMON
          What does that mean?

                         STEPHANIE
          Don't give me any more orders, that's all.
          She turns on the faucet and runs her lips under the water.

                         CUT TO:

          26. INT. MARINELAND. TRAINERS' OFFICE. DAY

          Two rooms adjoining the locker room. Two desks, and on the
          walls pictures of the trainers with their orcas, laminated
          posters of various training methods, files for each animal.
          Stephanie is in her diving suit, sitting in front of
          Louise, a 23-year-old woman who is reading a document about
          her internship.
          A trainer leaves the locker room, his backpack slung over
          his shoulder.

                         TRAINER
          Coming?
          No answer. Tension. He leaves without a word.
          Louise looks up. She has been crying. Stephanie looks at
          her, impassive. Louise swallows her tears.

                         LOUISE
          Really... this isn't fair.

                         23

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          No, Louise, there are lots of things you can
          say but not that. The pools are my
          responsibility and all I care about are the
          animals. I have to see to their environment
          and that starts with their trainers. Do you
          understand?

                         LOUISE
          What are you trying to make me believe, that
          I wasn't up to par?

                         STEPHANIE
          No, listen.

                         LOUISE
          Lacking in maturity? Skills?

                         STEPHANIE
          You're not consistent. We've already
          discussed that. The foundation of the
          relationship with the orcas is stability.
          During your internship you've had your ups
          and downs. It's not your competence that...

                         LOUISE
          You know this has nothing to do with my
          internship. You couldn't care less if I was
          competent or not! It has to do with that I
          fucked Michael. Just say so.

                         STEPHANIE
          Oh, please...

                         LOUISE
          And in fact what really bothers you is not
          that we fucked, but that he told me about
          you. How you think you're so... How you've
          become such a bitch. That's why you're
          firing me. That's what you should write in
          your report.

                         STEPHANIE
          Okay, are you done? We can stop here. No
          need to spoil the rest of your internship.
          Louise stands up.

                         24

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27. EXT. MARINELAND. POOL - DAY

          The empty stadium above the pool. The trainers walk along
          the gangplanks busily.
          In her diving suit, Stephanie leans over the "beach" of
          pool 3. She taps on the surface of the water. A wave
          forms, whirling around the pool.
          The whale washes up on the "beach" beside her. She performs
          what looks like a daily ritual. She examines the whale,
          caresses it. The whale responds with uncanny gurgles.

          28. EXT. MARINELAND. DAY

          Stock shots of a show at Marineland, or images which we
          will film to resemble stock shots: wide-angle shots from
          the stadium.
          The sound equipment blares "Jump" by Van Halen, orcas shoot
          out of the water, the audience applaudsâ¦ Little kids clutch
          electric-blue dolphin balloons, getting splashed by the
          orcasâ¦ Images of the show are relayed on giant video
          screens, orcas shoot by like torpedoes behind the plastic
          protective wall in front of the main pool, etcâ¦

                         CUT TO:

          29. INT. MARINELAND POOL. DAY

          All at once, silence. Then surface noise, but muted by the
          cubic meters of waterâ¦
          Underwater shots from pool number 3.
          Overhead, the surface shines like a mirror. In pool number
          3, a five-ton black shadow bides its time: it is Niska.
          Behind the grate in pool number 3, Niska watches her mates
          diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles.
          A mechanical creak, then the grate slowly begins to lift.
          It's about to be her turn.

                         25

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Niska swims into the big pool, slowly at first, but then
          picks up speed. She surfaces, disappears for a long beat,
          then again reappears, churning up a whirlpool of bubbles.
          On the other side of the mirror, the music blares and the
          crowd cheers.
          What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into
          the pool. We recognize Stephanie. She caresses Niska's
          rostrum, then kisses it, hanging onto her fins, waltzing
          with her up to the surface. Her hands look ridiculously
          tiny on the huge black fins. We see her face mirrored in
          one of the orca's huge black, gentle eyes. A liquid world
          of greens and blues whirls around them.
          Now, with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum,
          Stephanie has Niska swim around the pool, accelerating the
          water pressure and speed. The plastic wall rushes by, a
          rush of adrenalineâ¦ clouds of sediment are lifted as if by
          a gust of wind.
          A young male, Tom, joins Niska in pool number 1. Niska
          immediately rushes him, as if riled by the intrusion, and
          flattens him against the plastic wall.
          In the shifting reflections at the water's surface, we can
          make out Stephanie and two other trainers' faces on the
          âbeach'. Their palms beat on the water, summoning the orcas
          for their next number.
          Tom gathers some momentum, then shoots around Niska to jump
          into first place. He disappears a moment, then is back into
          the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning.
          Niska then gets into place and takes a running start, but
          just as she is about to shoot out of the water, Tom appears
          out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him.
          We sense chaos up above. Then we see Niska crash back into
          the water, with, one after the other, a piece of the huge
          video screen that towered over the stage, bits of scenery,
          and all kinds of random objects, as if Niska had carried
          away half the platform in her wakeâ¦ It all seems to fall
          in slow motion, like flecks of snow in a snow globe.
          Something sinks toward usâ¦ a body, floating weightless and
          disjointed in a cloud of red.

                         26

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30. EXT. MARINELAND - WHALE POOL. DAY

          Stephanie is on the rim of the pool. All around her: the
          audience panics, a loudspeaker orders evacuation, Louise
          leans over her.

                         STEPHANIE
          What... What happened?

                         LOUISE
          Tom and Niska... They got in each other's
          way.
          Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving
          suit. She tries to find a pressure point.
          Stephanie sees Louise's face wet with tears:

                         STEPHANIE
          Stop it, calm down. I'm fine!
          Her hand searches for something at thigh level, without
          finding it.
          She faints.

          31. EXT. ROAD TO THE BEACH. DAY

          Ali is wearing his MP3 headset. He runs down the road to
          the beach, sweat dripping into his eyes.

          32. EXT. ANNA'S HOUSE. DAY

          Sam's toys are lying scattered in the garden, his half-
          eaten snack is on the table. Ali takes off his headset.

                         ALI
          Sam!
          No answer. There is some noise over at the kennel. He goes
          and finds Sam in the kennel, talking to the puppies.

                         ALI
          What are you doing here?

                         27

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Sam jumps and scuttles to the back of the kennel, but Ali
          reaches in and grabs him by the arm. Sam is covered in mud,
          straw and dog shit.

                         ALI
          You're gross! You stink! Who's taking care
          of you?
          Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down. The
          water is freezing cold. Sam hops from one foot to the other
          and screams.

                         SAM
          Stop it, Dad! It's cold. Stop!
          Sam shrieks. An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee-
          shirt comes out of a neighboring house: Joelle, the
          neighbors' daughter.

                         ALI
          Aren't you supposed to be taking care of
          him? What the fuck are you up to?

                         JOELLE
          I was next doing the laundry.

                         ALI
          Take a look at him!

                         JOELLE
          I'll put him in the shower.

                         ALI
          (to Sam, crying) Don't go in there. It's
          disgusting. You hear?
          Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside.
          Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open
          door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel.
          Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset
          photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on
          the back of a killer whale. ïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïï

                         JOELLE
          There was an accident at Marineland.
          Ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen.

                         ALI
          I know her.
          Sam pulls off his towel. He watches his father who is
          riveted to the screen, glued to the looping footage of the
          accident.

          33. INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' LOUNGE. NIGHT

          Silence.
          The silence of an on-duty nurses' lounge: a table, a
          microwave on a mini-fridge, and Louise, standing by the
          window sipping coffee.
          She is wearing a fleece jacket, her hair messily pulled
          back. She hasn't had any sleep.
          She hears a scream. She rushes into the corridor.

          34. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. NIGHT

          Chaos. Louise rushes into the room. She finds Stephanie
          crawling on the floor, dragging her IVs.
          She hesitates, overwhelmed, then calls for help.

                         LOUISE
          Help! Help! Please!
          On the linoleum, two stumps stick out of Stephanie's
          nightshirt: two thick bandages surround her thighs that
          look like two wrapped hams.

                         STEPHANIE
          My legs! What did you do with my legs?
          Two nurses arrive.
          Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms. Louise rocks
          her gently. Stephanie's eyes struggle against sleep. She
          wants to scream again, but doesn't have the strength. She

                         29

                         

                         

                         

                         
          falls asleep in Louise's arms. She feels eight years old.
          Black.

          35. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY/NIGHT

          A series of scenes, day and night, fade into one another,
          always from the same POV.
          In the foreground, looking our way, is Stephanie's face
          and, behind, the visitors who succeed one another.
          Stephanie's eyes are shut.
          She opens them:
          - The other trainers from Marineland, holding bouquets.
          They are silent and look devastated. They occasionally
          speak to each other in whispers.
          Stephanie closes her eyes.
          Black.
          Stephanie opens her eyes:
          - Louise is seated nearby

                         LOUISE
          I stopped by your place. I saw the cleaning
          woman. She didn't want me to pay her. She
          was... in shock. She's scared to come here.
          She sends her regards.
          She closes her eyes.
          Black.
          She opens them.
          - A blonde, pretty woman in her fifties is sitting
          behind Stephanie, her face is close to hers. It is her
          mother. She speaks with a slight accent.

                         MOTHER
          I spoke to your brothers. They wanted to
          talk to you but I didn't think it was the
          right time. We'll all come with Hugo during
          the next school break... I was afraid I
          might lose you. I don't know what I'd have

                         30

                         

                         

                         

                         
          done... It may seem selfish. In any case,
          you've always done whatever you wanted. But
          this time I was so scared that I don't think
          I'll ever be scared again.
          Her eyes close.
          Black.
          Her eyes reopen.
          The surgeon and his assistants.
          The orthopedist and his assistants.
          Her eyes close.
          Black.
          Her eyes open.
          - Simon is there, looking stiff and ill at ease.
          He tries not to make any noise as he puts a bunch of keys
          on the night stand. He leans over and kisses her hair.
          Her eyes close.
          Black.
          It's her mother again, but this time accompanied by a tall,
          uncomfortable looking blond teenage boy. She leans over to
          kiss her.

                         MOTHER
          (in German) Hugo wanted to say goodbye to
          you. We're leaving tomorrow but we'll pray
          for you, honey.
          Her eyes remain open.
          Black.

          36. EXT. MARINELAND. NIGHT

          The bluish light at the bottom the main pool at Marineland.
          A diver is raking its bottom, wiping away sludge composed
          of micro algae, paint chips and fish bones. He examines the
          replacement mud and then, inside the drain, the mud being
          replaced. He digs his hand into the sediment and feels
          something there. He surfaces and deposits his find on the
          rim of the pool: It is one of Stephanie's diving flippers,
          with her foot cut off at the ankle.

                         31

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CUT TO:

          37. INT. STEPHANIE'S NEW APARTMENT - BATHROOM. NIGHT

          Stephanie wakes up with a start in her handicapped bathtub.
          She tries to grab the bars but can't find them. She rolls
          over on herself like a floating log. She panics.

                         CUT TO:

          38. INT. HOSPITAL - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - EVENING

          There are several rows of parallel bars, with amputees
          hanging on to them as they relearn to walk with their
          prosthetics. Most of them are old. Nurses help them along.
          From her wheelchair, Stephanie watches, looking glum and as
          if at a great distance. Her hair is greasy and her face
          swollen by her medication and induced sleep.
          She looks through the big window that opens onto the
          exterior. Outside, amputees smoke and chat. She notices one
          group, livelier than the rest. At its center, a guy is
          smoking a cigarette he holds in a pincer in the place of
          his hand. His name is Gilles.

          39. INT. GILLES' CAR. EVENING

          Four of them are smoking a joint in Gilles' Megane.
          Outside, evening is falling over the convalescent center's
          parking lot.
          Stephanie is sitting up front. She passes the joint to
          Gilles, who takes it in his chrome pincer. She notices the
          scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth.
          There is a couple in the backseat, making out: Raphael (his
          arms are missing and his sleeves are pinned up at his
          shoulders) and Julia.

                         GILLES
          (to Stephanie) Want me to tell you
          something?

                         32

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE

                         Â¦

                         GILLES
          You haven't finished mourning, that's all!

                         STEPHANIE
          Really? Mourning who?

                         GILLES
          Your legs.

                         STEPHANIE
          Mourning my legs?

                         GILLES
          Yes.
          He sounds as serious as a civics teacher. She looks at him,
          incredulous. Raphael sticks his head up front.

                         RAPHAEL
          Pass me the joint...
          Gilles' pincer and joint go for Raphael's lips. He takes a
          long hit.

                         GILLES
          They were a part of you. When a man dies, he
          gets buried. There's a ceremony, a prayer...
          Now a piece of you ended up in a hospital
          trashcan without a prayer, without any time
          for meditation.
          A beat. She is dumbstruck. She cannot believe what she's
          hearing. In the backseat, Raphael exhales some smoke into
          Julia's open mouth.
          GILLES (cont'd)
          You have to think about it symbolically...

                         STEPHANIE
          Yeah, it's really symbolic...

                         33

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GILLES
          I know where my arm is. We buried it under a
          nice oak tree behind my house in the
          scrubland. My wife and kids came and we
          sang...
          Stephanie has a fit of the giggles.

                         GILLES
          (a bit vexed) You think I'm kidding?

                         STEPHANIE
          No, it's the grass. I'll stop...
          She laughs so hard she cries.

                         RAPHAEL
          Shit, it's a laugh riot up there. (to
          Gilles) Can you take us home?
          She looks back and, between the seats, notices the girl
          toying with Raphael's fly.

                         GILLES
          I'm too beat. I'll take a nap, then go. (to
          Stephanie) How are you getting home?

          40. EXT/INT. HYPERBRICO. NIGHT

          A HyperBrico DIY store in an industrial zone in Cannes. Its
          windows shine in the night like an aquarium.

          41. INT. HYPERBRICO. NIGHT

          Ali and Kadhi, a huge guard accompanied by a dog, make
          their rounds. They open doors with a magnetic key, each
          time recording their passage on electronic terminals.
          A bit before midnight, someone knocks at the main entrance.
          Ali goes to look. It's a guy in a leather jacket and
          baseball cap, with a backpack and a shoulder bag.

                         ALI
          What do you want?

                         34

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARTIAL
          To come in.
          The guy takes out a card and presses it against the glass
          door: it's the business card of ALTA SECU, the security
          agency.

                         ALI
          Hey, Kadhi, come here!
          Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy.

                         KADHI
          Okay, okay... Are you Martial?

                         MARTIAL
          Yeah.

                         KADHI
          Give me your keys.

                         ALI
          Who's he?

                         KADHI
          It's fine. The boss told me he was coming.
          He works for the company.
          Ali hands him the bunch of keys.

          42. INT. HYPERBRICO - AISLES. NIGHT

          Ali goes down an aisle looking for something and finally
          finds what he was looking for: a folding ladder.

          43. INT. HYPERBRICO - STOCK ROOM. NIGHT

          Martial has spread out his material in a stock room at the
          back of the store at the end of a corridor formed by
          palettes: precision tools, drills, electronic mini-cameras
          still in their wrapping, cases equipped with antennae,
          packs of batteries... A small radio is playing a night
          program on Radio Monte Carlo.
          Equipped with a small headlamp, Martial carefully cuts a
          hole in a cardboard box with his Leatherman scissors. He
          conceals a tiny camera inside.

                         35

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ali arrives with the ladder over his shoulder.

                         ALI
          Will this do?

                         MARTIAL
          Perfect. Put it down there.
          Martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf.

                         MARTIAL
          Imagine you're the manager of a big store
          like this and the union reps have been
          busting your balls. What do you do?

                         ALI
          Fire them.

                         MARTIAL
          You think that's how it works? What do you
          do before you fire them?
          He checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole,
          then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket
          monitor.

                         MARTIAL
          Well, beforehand you try to see how long
          they spend in the restroom, if they take
          extra-long coffee breaks, smoke on the
          premises, steal from the stockroom, rip
          customers off with the sales receipts...
          When you know all that, you put the pressure
          on them and you fire the ones who don't
          leave.
          Can you give me a stroll down the aisle?

                         ALI
          A stroll?

                         MARTIAL
          Walk down the aisle. No, further down, like
          you came out of that door there. Good,
          perfect...
          Ali twice passes within the camera's field of vision.
          Martial climbs down his ladder.

                         36

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARTIAL
          That's it.

                         ALI
          Okay, then I'll be getting back.

                         MARTIAL
          Hold on!
          Martial pulls a 10 Euro bill from a jacket pocket.

                         ALI
          It's fine.

                         MARTIAL
          Take it.
          Angle on the bill in Ali's hand.

          44. INT. SUPERMARKET - SECURITY ROOM. NIGHT

          Ali is in the security room reading a kickboxing magazine.
          A small radio is playing a late evening program. Outside
          in the parking lot, Kadhi smokes while walking his dog. The
          dog takes its time. Ali watches Kadhi pull on the leash.
          Ali's cell phone rings. The screen reads âunknown'.

                         ALI
          Hello?

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          It's Stephanie. Remember me? We met at the
          Fever.
          Ali is taken by surprise.

                         ALI
          Yeah... How are you doing?
          She sniggers. Her speech sounds slow and thick.

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          You know what happened to me?

                         37

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Yeah... I saw the papersâ¦ the news on TVâ¦
          How are you?

                         STEPHANIE
          (sniggering) How do you think I am?
          A beat. Ali is at a loss to answer.

                         STEPHANIE
          How are you?

                         ALI
          Okay... normal.

                         STEPHANIE
          Still a bouncer?

                         ALI
          No, not really.

                         STEPHANIE
          You want to get together?

                         ALI
          Yeah, but nights are tough. I'm a security
          guard now. Three nights a week.

                         STEPHANIE
          I'm... crazy busy too. Every day and every
          night. I don't know how to manage...
          A beat.

                         STEPHANIE
          Now.

                         ALI
          Huh?

                         STEPHANIE
          Come now.

          45. EXT. ANTIBES - INDUSTRIAL ZONE AND STREETS - DAWN

          The Speciale 50 putt-putts in the early morning light. Ali
          drives through a neighborhood of chain stores, Conforama,

                         38

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Courtepaille, Leroy-Merlin...

          46. EXT. STEPHANIE'S RESIDENCE - DAY

          A gated community made up of four story buildings, lawns,
          bougainvillea and lavender. It looks pretty as a picture
          and squeaky clean.

          47. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. DAY

          The door opens automatically. He is surprised. He hears a
          tired voice from inside.

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          Come in.
          She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote
          control. She activates it and the door closes behind Ali.
          Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there
          are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T-
          shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom
          whose legs hang limp.

                         STEPHANIE
          Have you been waiting long?

                         ALI
          No... I just got here.

                         STEPHANIE
          Was that you who rang before?
          She looks exhausted but feverish.

                         ALI
          No.

                         STEPHANIE
          Come in. Sit down.
          He sits down on a small couch.

                         STEPHANIE
          Want something to drink? A coffee?

                         39

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Yes.

                         STEPHANIE
          I only have instant.

                         ALI
          That's fine.
          It takes two tries to activate the wheels on her
          wheelchair.

                         ALI
          Need any help?
          She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her
          wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen. He sees her pajama
          legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap.

                         ALI
          Have you been living here long?

                         STEPHANIE
          I don't know... Three or four months.

                         ALI
          (looking around)... It's nice.
          She comes back.

                         ALI
          Are you alone? You got no one to help you?

                         STEPHANIE
          Help me what? Walk?

                         ALI
          No, for the cleaning and everything...

                         STEPHANIE
          Yeah there are people. They come and go.
          Hold on.
          She manages to navigate from the living room into her
          bedroom. He stays in the living room. He hears a kettle
          whistle in the kitchen. He goes into the kitchen and pours
          water into the glass/mug. He finds her hunched over in her

                         40

                         

                         

                         

                         
          wheelchair. She is nodding off, high on her medication.

                         ALI
          Hey, are you okay?

                         STEPHANIE
          I'm fine.
          He opens the window.

                         STEPHANIE
          Does it stink here?

                         ALI
          Yeah, a little.

                         STEPHANIE
          It's me.
          He opens the curtains and looks outside. It is getting hot
          out. The automatic sprinklers have gone on.

                         ALI
          Let's go out. (No answer) Hey, you hear me?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes.

                         ALI
          Let's go out.

                         STEPHANIE
          No.

                         ALI
          Get dressed.

                         STEPHANIE
          Leave me alone.

                         ALI
          Where are your clothes?
          He opens the closet.

                         41

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48. EXT. STEPHANIE'S RESIDENCE - DAY

          When they come out of the building's lobby, the sun hits
          him on the head like a bad hangover.

                         ALI
          Here.
          Ali hands her a pair of sunglasses.

                         ALI
          Where should we go?

                         STEPHANIE
          I don't know. You're the one who wanted to
          go out...

                         ALI
          Should we go to the ocean?

                         STEPHANIE
          I don't care.
          He tries to push the wheelchair, but she stops him:

                         STEPHANIE
          Stop it. I want to puke.
          He notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a
          sprinkler area. He goes to free it and gets splashed...
          Heavy chain, padlock... he comes back with soiled hands.
          When he comes back, she's gone. He sees the wheelchair
          moving toward the seafront avenue. He goes to join her.

          49. EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

          They are sitting at a table on a terrace facing the beach.
          They remain silent. She looks at his huge fists, black with
          axle grease.

                         ALI
          I want to go in.

                         STEPHANIE

          â¦ ?

                         42

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          I feel like swimming!

                         STEPHANIE
          Go ahead.

                         ALI
          You don't want to?

                         STEPHANIE
          Huh?

                         ALI
          You don't feel like swimming?
          She looks daggers at him.

                         ALI
          You don't have a bathing suit?

                         STEPHANIE
          Do you realize what you're saying?

                         ALI
          Who the fuck cares? There's no one here!

                         STEPHANIE
          Forget it.
          He wavers a moment, then finally crosses the seafront
          avenue.

          50. EXT. PRIVATE BEACH. DAY

          Stephanie is at the top of the steps in her wheelchair.
          Ali is talking with the beach boy when he notices her.
          Ali and the beach boy carry her to the deck chair area.
          Ali rents the whole shebang: parasol, beach towel, deck
          chair and a small tube of sunscreen 50.
          Sheltered under a parasol, she pancakes her face with cream
          and watches him dive in, wearing his boxers, and noisily
          and clumsily crawl some laps. His body is pink and white.
          Huge and buff. Then she looks out to sea, the listless
          waves washing in and out. The fresh feel of it all makes

                         43

                         

                         

                         

                         
          her want to drink it all in.
          He comes back, enthusiastic and dripping wet.
          She looks around. The beach is deserted, other than for a
          far off, elderly couple broiling in the sun.

                         STEPHANIE
          Actually I think I will go in.
          He looks at her. She covers herself with a towel and
          wiggles out of her pants, revealing what remains of her
          legs. Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their
          extremities.

                         STEPHANIE
          You have to carry me. Help me...

                         ALI
          (makes a gesture)... How, like this?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes.
          He lifts her up and carries her to the water. He takes her
          far enough in until she begins to float.

                         ALI
          You okay?

                         STEPHANIE
          Don't let me go! Not right away... Do it
          gently.
          She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually.
          She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and
          grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread
          water. He joins her. She grabs onto him.

                         ALI
          So?

                         STEPHANIE
          I can't stop. If I do, I sink. Wait...
          She gesticulates...

                         44

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          This is bothering me!
          She takes off her T-shirt and hands it to him. Her breasts
          press against Ali's chest.

                         STEPHANIE
          Okay, you can let go.
          She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put,
          holding her t-shirt.
          Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a
          burst of laughter.
          Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time
          to see how she's doing.
          She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She
          motions for him to come and get her.
          He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on
          to him, still out of breath.

                         ALI
          You swim like a real pro!...
          She shuts her eyes.

                         STEPHANIE
          Fuck that's good!
          The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck
          chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away.
          They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her
          lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe.

                         STEPHANIE
          Thanks.

                         ALI
          Huh?

                         STEPHANIE
          Thanks.

                         45

                         

                         

                         

                         
          She rolls onto her back. He sees her breasts pointed
          heavenward.

          51. INT. GYM. DAY

          A decrepit, simple, functional, but reasonably clean
          workout room. Guys of every color work the punching bags,
          lift weights, do chin-ups... From the gym next door, we
          hear the booming music of an aerobics class.
          In a small ring at floor level, Ali and Foued, loaded down
          with protective gear, pound each other. Each of their blows
          lands right on target. They repeat the same series of moves
          several times at varying speeds.

          52. INT. GYM - CORRIDOR. DAY

          Ali and Foued are dripping wet. They have towels around
          their necks. They fill their small plastic bottles at a
          faucet in the workout room.
          Through a large window in the corridor, Ali watches the
          aerobic class going on in the gym: legs and feet moving in
          rhythm, red faces, sweaty underarms, butts, boobs and the
          braid of the instructor, who uses it to beat the measure,
          as she swings it from one shoulder to the other.

                         FOUED
          I have to get back. I need to train.
          Ali nods, without actually looking at him.

          53. EXT. GYM - STREET. DAY

          Outside, Ali has unwrapped the sandwich his sister had
          prepared for him. A bit farther off, the aerobics
          instructor is smoking in the sun. She has a short, buff
          body. She smokes her cigarette like someone who counts them
          out sparingly.
          They remain like that a while, he chewing ands she smoking.

                         CUT TO

                         46

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54. INT. GYM - EQUIPMENT ROOM. DAY

          A cell phone vibrates. Through a narrow transom, a ray of
          sun slices through the dark equipment room. They haven't
          bothered undressing. Ali and the aerobics instructor are
          making love on a pile of workout mats.
          Ali's cell phone continues to vibrate, goes silent,
          vibrates again. He answers. We hear a crackling voice.

                         ALI
          I'm still at the gym. I'm leaving... I said
          I'm leaving!
          He hangs up. They continue.

          55. EXT. NUSERY SCHOOL - SCHOOLYARD. DAY

          Sam is playing alone, perched up on monkey bars in the
          schoolyard.
          Through a wide window, he sees his father racing down a
          corridor that runs alongside the schoolyard. The principal
          is waiting for him at the door. Ali spurts out some quick
          apologies.
          Sam slowly slides off the structure. We hear the noise of
          his hands skidding on metal.

          56. EXT ANTIBES EVENING
          The moped wheezes and sputters.
          Ali and Sam are heading back home along the beach. Ali is
          so big, the moped looks like a kid's bike. Behind him on
          the luggage rack, he can feel Sam leaning into him. Sam's
          hand rummages in his coat pocket for a box of Choco-BN
          cookies. Ali takes one too.
          To their left, a train noisily speeds by.

          57. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. DAY

          Louise has a set of keys. She enters Stephanie's apartment
          with the mail.

                         47

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LOUISE
          Steph!
          Made up and well-groomed, she looks older than she actually
          is.
          Stephanie answers from the bathroom.

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          I'm in here!
          Louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters
          the bedroom. Stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom,
          her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel.

                         LOUISE
          Shit, you're not ready! The appointment is
          in a half hour!

                         STEPHANIE
          It's fine!

                         LOUISE
          What do you mean? You're a freaking pain! I
          have to get back to work. Come on, let me
          help you.
          She grabs the arms of the wheelchair and pushes Stephanie
          toward the closet.

                         STEPHANIE
          Let go of me! Stop, I can manage alone.

                         LOUISE
          Oh yeah? Okay, so manage then!
          She lets go of the wheelchair and leaves the bedroom.

          58. EXT. STÃPHANIE'S RESIDENCE. DAY

          Louise briskly pushes Stephanie's wheelchair across the
          residence garden. The warning lights on her 205 are
          blinking in front of the gate.
          Stephanie hangs onto Louise's neck. Louise lifts her out of
          her wheelchair as best she can and into the passenger seat.

                         48

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Louise bends down to buckle Stephanie's seat belt.

                         STEPHANIE
          (annoyed) I can do the seat belt!
          In front of the open trunk, Louise struggles to fold the
          wheelchair.

                         LOUISE
          Can't you call them to tell them we're going
          to be late?

          59. INT. PROSTHESIST'S OFFICE. DAY

          In CU: the brochures of prosthetic manufacturersâ¦ we see
          pictures of the various models go by.
          Stephanie is in the doctor's office with Doctor Vitias. He
          is in his fifties and is wearing a white jacket.

                         VITIAS
          We'll order two pairs of prosthetic devices,
          one for everyday life and one for the sport
          you do.
          Stephanie pages through the various brochures.

                         STEPHANIE
          Don't you have something simpler, classier?

                         VITIAS
          What do you mean by classier?

                         STEPHANIE
          I don't know... like a wooden leg with a
          piece of rubber at the end?

                         VITIAS
          (smiling) No, sorry. We don't make those
          models anymore.
          Louise shuts her eyes, visibly exasperated.

                         STEPHANIE
          Or just a plank. A plank with wheels and
          straps. And irons to move forward with.

                         49

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LOUISE
          (furious) Can you cut it out?

                         STEPHANIE
          What? If I want...

                         LOUISE
          I've had enough of your schtick, you hear
          me?

                         STEPHANIE
          Come on...

                         LOUISE
          Shut up!
          Stephanie shuts up. Vitias still looks patient as Job.

          60. INT. PROSTHESIST'S OFFICE. DAY

          Sitting on an examination table, Stephanie waits for the
          resin bands wrapped around her stumps to dry.
          Louise is sitting on a stool across from Stephanie. Their
          eyes meet.

                         STEPHANIE
          Go if you wantâ¦ I'll take a taxi.

                         LOUISE
          I told them I was with you.

                         STEPHANIE
          And that works? If you tell them you're with
          me, do they let you do what you want?

                         LOUISE
          Well...

                         STEPHANIE
          Cool. If ever you want a day off, just tell
          me. I'll write you a note.
          Louise looks at her. She's not going to let her get on her
          nerves.
          There is a knock at the door. A nurse enters.
          She checks the resin bands, looks at her watch.

                         50

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         NURSE
          10 more minutes, just to make sure. Then
          Doctor Vitias will come for you.
          She smiles and closes the door.
          The two young women are again left alone. Stephanie
          stretches out her hand. Louise takes it.
          And they remain like that.

          61. INT. HYPERBRICO - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

          In close up on the screen of a small DVD player: amateur
          images of two bare-chested guys fighting in the garden of a
          suburban house. It looks like a wild boxing match, free-
          for-all vale tudo in which anything goes.
          In the Bricorama security room, Ali, Kadhi and Martial,
          excited, are bent over the screen.
          A few blows to the face have one of the combatants KO on
          the lawn.

                         KADHI
          Look at the next one! Watch how he whacks
          him.
          A change of scene on the small screen: a courtyard between
          two tower blocks, with new combatants, but with the same
          amateur images and the same violence.

                         KADHI
          (pointing to the screen)... I know him. I
          fought him twice in Nationals. He's not bad.
          He was at the boxing club in Marseille.
          Martial watches Ali, fascinated by the images, as if he
          were sizing him up.

          62. INT. PROJECTS. DAY

          An apartment in a Golfe Juan housing project. After-dinner
          time. Kids are playing, women doing the dishes.
          On the living room couch, under a tapestry of a lion hunt
          in Technicolor, Martial blows on his glass of tea. His

                         51

                         

                         

                         

                         
          cousin is sitting across from him. Ali is on a stool at the
          end of the table.

                         MARTIAL
          He says he's done Thai boxing. He can fight.
          He's enormous. He's not afraid of taking
          punches, and he's white.

                         COUSIN
          I see.
          The cousin turns to Ali. He takes his time sizing him up.

                         COUSIN
          Is that true? You like to fight?

                         ALI
          Yeah.

                         COUSIN
          Okay, so I organize the fights. I pick the
          fighters. I see if the money's there. I ref.
          I collect the dough... I take a third of the
          bets. The rest goes to the winner...

                         MARTIAL
          A third of how much?

                         COUSIN
          We don't fight for less than 800.
          Ali does the division in his head.

                         MARTIAL
          So?
          Ali hesitates.

                         ALI
          (to Martial) There's something I don't get:
          how much do you take?

                         MARTIAL
          I don't know. You tell me. How much do you
          need? I'll take 20% of what you win. How's
          that?

                         52

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          And how much does your cousin give you?

                         MARTIAL
          Oh, I introduced you to him, didn't I? How's
          that?

                         ALI
          Okay.
          The cousin stands up. They all shake on it.

          63. INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY

          Ali is in a corner of the living room, sitting in front of
          Anna's old PC and watching some fight videos he's found.
          Anna rushes into the room.

                         ANNA
          Keep Sam with you for 5 minutes!
          She hurries to find some papers in the drawer of a commode.
          Ali hasn't budged.

                         ANNA
          Oh! Hear me? I don't want your son in the
          garden.

                         ALI
          Yeah, I heard.
          He gets up and goes to get Sam who is playing behind the
          house. Anna finds her papers and leaves in another
          direction.

                         ALI
          Sam! Come here! I want to show you some
          stuff!
          He lifts Sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer.

                         ALI
          Look how they fight...
          He clicks on an image and the fight continues... the
          audience's noise as well. Sam watches, intrigued. Ali

                         53

                         

                         

                         

                         
          commentates, pointing to guys onscreen.

                         ALI
          Look at him, in red. See how strong he is?

                         SAM
          Is he the good guy?

                         ALI
          No, he's the bad guy. Look how he tries to
          grab his legs. Wait.
          His phone vibrates. He takes it from his pocket. It's
          Martial. He answers.

                         ALI
          Hello? Yeah...

                         SAM
          Why is the red one the bad guy? Daddy?

                         ALI
          I don't know. Look and tell me who wins.
          He turns down the sound, settles Sam on the stool and gets
          up to go speak.

                         ALI
          (into the phone) So? What did he say? Which
          others? How many?
          Sam watches the fight in silence. Dogs bark in the garden.
          Sam feels something coming. He looks out the window, then
          goes running.
          Ali hasn't noticed a thing and continues his phone
          conversation.

                         ALI
          What is this bullshit? What do you mean, a
          tournament?

          64. INT. ARAB CAFÃ. DAY

          Martial is leaning on the bar of a noisy Arab cafe/betting
          office, talking into his phone.

                         54

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARTIAL
          Last one standing gets the money. I know,
          but he says it's better that way. Do you
          think you're in a position to negotiate a
          percentage? Where did you get that idea
          from? He gave me a website if you want to
          see the others.
          He takes out a small spiral notebook.

          65. INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY

          From the living room, Ali hears Sam screaming in the
          garden.

                         ALI
          Tell him to give the website to his mother.
          All I see is me doing more fights and him
          making more dough.
          Ali goes to the window.
          Outside, near the kennel, Sam has lunged at a guy in a
          jumpsuit who is helping Anna get the puppies into a metal
          cage. Sam is screaming. Anna tries to take him into her
          arms. Sam clutches the bars of the cage. The puppies bark.
          Anna finally manages to rip Sam free and drag him back into
          the house.

                         ALI
          (into the phone) He's changing the rules and
          so am I... I couldn't care less.
          Anna storms into the living room. Sam is shrieking, having
          a tantrum. He kicks and bites.

                         ALI
          I'm on the phone!

                         ANNA
          What the hell? I asked you to watch him for
          5 minutes!

                         ALI
          (into the phone) I'll call you back.
          Ali hangs up.

                         55

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Outside, the kennel keeper rolls the cage across the
          garden. Anna hugs Sam in her arms.

                         ANNA
          (to Sam) He's taking them to the country.
          They'll be so happy there.

                         SAM
          Leave me alone. They're my babies!
          Sam refuses to calm down. Anna looks at her brother.

                         ANNA
          What are you doing? Are you his father or
          not?

                         ALI
          You're such a pain in the ass.

                         ANNA
          Don't talk to me like that!
          Ali rips the child from his sister's grip. Sam struggles.

                         ALI
          Stop it now! I said stop! Calm the fuck
          down!

                         SAM
          Let go of me! Let go!
          Sam kicks out. Ali shakes him.

                         ALI
          Cut it out, dammit! You're such a pain!
          He flings the child away. Sam's head hits the coffee table.
          Silence.
          Anna rushes over and picks up Sam, who has stopped crying.
          He's been knocked out. Anna is frightened. She examines his
          scalp, she strokes his head. She trembles. A cut on his
          head begins to bleed. She kisses the wound. Ali comes over,
          upset.

                         56

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ANNA
          Don't touch him! Don't touch him I said! You
          know what? You're... you're a bad person.
          Huddled against Anna's breasts, Sam opens his eyes.

          66. EXT. BEACH. DAY

          The day is over. The beach boy has already packed away most
          of his paraphernalia. In the water, Ali and Stephanie are
          out with some of the last swimmers.
          Faithful to what by now seems to have become a habit, he
          carries her piggyback to their lounge chairs. They come out
          of the water in the middle of a discussion.

                         STEPHANIE
          What kind of boxing? Thai? Do you use your
          feet?

                         ALI
          No, just fists I think. We bash each other's
          faces and whoever's still standing at the
          end wins. Hey, you're strangling me!
          He puts her down on her chair.

                         STEPHANIE
          Is it the first time you're doing this?

                         ALI
          Yeah.

                         STEPHANIE
          And you're not scared?

                         ALI
          Of what?

                         STEPHANIE
          How much do they pay you for this?

                         ALI
          I don't know. About 500, 1000 maybe.

                         57

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          You're doing that for 500 euros?

                         ALI
          Um, yeah.

                         STEPHANIE
          You're going to get whacked on the face and
          risk your health for 500 euros?

                         ALI
          Risk my health? What are you talking about?
          Why are you getting so worked up?

                         STEPHANIE
          I'll give you the 500! Cancel it and I'll
          give it to you tomorrow.

                         ALI
          You can give it to me if you have too much
          money, but I said I was doing it and I am.
          That's all.

                         STEPHANIE
          If it's not for money, why then?

                         ALI
          I didn't say it's not for the money!

                         STEPHANIE
          Why are you doing it?

                         ALI
          Oh, stop driving me crazy! I'm doing it to
          fight. For fun. Why did you clown around on
          your fish? For the fun of it, right?
          She grins.

                         STEPHANIE
          Yeah and look how I ended up.

                         ALI
          Spare me. You turn on the waterworks when
          you feel like it.

                         58

                         

                         

                         

                         
          She dries her eyes. He begins to pack things up.

                         STEPHANIE
          Your fight, if you do it...

                         ALI
          Mm?

                         STEPHANIE
          You think I can come along?

          67. EXT/INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY

          A narrow road. Down below, a town. The Mercedes Vito with
          the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust.
          Stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the
          overhead strap to avoid hurting herself.
          At the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge
          homies. They signal Martial to over.
          He rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside.
          They see Ali and Stephanie in the back.

                         HOMEBOY 1
          Who's she?

                         MARTIAL
          His girlfriend.
          Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his
          reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial
          drives in.

          68. EXT / INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY

          Ali and Stephanie are alone in the car. Through the tinted
          windows, they can see a concrete yard with boats dry-docked
          around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding
          every balcony. Some men are over in one corner,
          discussing: Martial, his cousin and some other mean looking
          guys.
          In the shade, a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans,
          is a bare-chested, muscle-bound North African. He warms up,

                         59

                         

                         

                         

                         
          wagging his head from left to right.

                         ALI
          (under his breath) Motherfucker's acting
          like he's on Canal Plus.

                         STEPHANIE
          Who are the other guys?

                         ALI
          I don't know. Guys with money. Dealers.
          A beat.

                         STEPHANIE
          You okay?

                         ALI
          Great.
          Martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into
          the passenger seat.

                         MARTIAL
          It's okay. Let's go. Fall against the big
          one in black shorts. I told you. They're big
          guys.

                         ALI
          Okay. And the bets? How much is there?

                         MARTIAL
          A little over 2000 for the time being. But
          it'll go up during the final match.

                         STEPHANIE
          What do I do?

                         MARTIAL
          No girls. Stay in the car. (To Ali) You
          ready?
          Ali nods.

                         60

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69. EXT. PROJECTS COURTYARD. DAY

          The blazing sun is melting the asphalt. A coin bounces
          between pairs of basketball shoes.
          The cousin picks it up. He points to Ali and the guy in the
          black shorts.

                         COUSIN
          You and you.
          Ali pulls off his T-shirt, staring down his adversary.
          Martial takes the T shirt and leans over to Ali.

                         MARTIAL
          If you get into trouble, don't insist, just
          fall.
          Ali doesn't flinch. The cousin, the bettors and the other
          fighters move away.

          70. INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY

          Stephanie watches the faces leaning over the balconies
          overhead. She hears the spectators' hostility and cheers.
          A circle has formed around the fighters.
          She sees the shadow, and only the shadow, of his opponent's
          fist barely miss Ali's face.
          Then things speed up. Ali uses his feet, knees and fists.
          When his opponent begins to totter to one side, Ali hangs
          onto him like a pit bull. When he falls, Ali pounds on his
          face with his fists and elbows. The âref' has to enlist
          Cousin's help to pull Ali away.
          Ali returns to his place in the car. Stephanie looks at
          him: he can't sit still.

                         ALI
          I have to go.
          Another combat begins, while Ali jogs around the hangar.
          Stephanie watches other combats, whether featuring Ali or
          not.

                         61

                         

                         

                         

                         
          She sees feet dancing on the concrete.
          She sees the banknotes in people's hands.
          She sees heads leaning over balconies.
          She sees an opponent's fist hit Ali behind the ear.
          She sees another of Ali's opponents get back to his feet,
          and Ali's fist split open his nose like a ripe fig.
          She sees another opponent's head bounce off the concrete.
          She sees a tooth roll across the concrete, like dice in a
          crap game.
          She sees Ali perform three steps of a moonwalk and kiss his
          own biceps.

          71. EXT. ROAD. DAY

          A cloud of dust, a narrow, bumpy road. Martial's car is
          headed for the town below.

          72. INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY

          CU on a long cut behind Ali's ear. Stephanie's fingers use
          a Kleenex instead of cotton.
          Bare-chested with a towel around his neck, Ali leans
          forward to make his wound more easily accessible.

                         STEPHANIE
          It's nothing, just a cut. (to Martial) Got
          anything to disinfect it with?

                         MARTIAL
          (driving) No.

                         STEPHANIE
          (to Ali) Keep this on it. It's the only one
          I have.
          Ali looks up at her.

                         ALI
          You liked it.

                         62

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes.

                         ALI
          Me too.
          He again lowers his head.

                         STEPHANIE
          Put this on it. It's the only one I have.
          Ali straightens up, covers himself with the towel and
          remains like that: invisible, out of breath, clearing his
          throat and spitting out the window... Stephanie observes
          the welts on his body.
          A big service station appears a bit farther down the road.
          Ali sits back up.

                         ALI
          Pull over here. I'll go rinse off my face.
          (puts out his hand) Give me 50.
          Martial uses his turn signal.

          73. INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY

          Behind the wheel of his stopped car, Martial counts the
          bills spread out on his lap.

                         MARTIAL
          Have you known him for long?

                         STEPHANIE
          No, not very.
          Alone in the back seat, Stephanie looks out at the service
          station.

                         STEPHANIE
          What do you want to know? If I knew him
          before the accident?
          Martial looks back.

                         63

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARTIAL
          What?

                         STEPHANIE
          You find it weird that we're together? You
          wonder what he's doing with me?

                         MARTIAL
          No, since you know him, I just wanted to
          know if you've seen him like that before?

                         STEPHANIE
          No.
          Martial finishes counting the bills.

                         MARTIAL
          He freaks me out.
          He takes his share and hands Stephanie the envelope.

                         MARTIAL
          1200 for him.
          She looks at the envelope without taking it.

                         STEPHANIE
          Why are you giving me that?

                         MARTIAL
          It's for Ali.

                         STEPHANIE
          Exactly. So why give it to me?
          He looks at her, suddenly surprised.

                         MARTIAL
          Hey, you make it complicated. Either you
          take it or you don't. And either I talk or I
          keep my mouth shut.
          He tosses the envelope at her. She looks away. Ali finally
          gets back into the car with a big box. It's a toy: a green
          John Deere tractor with all the accessories.

                         64

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          For my kid.

                         STEPHANIE
          You have a kid?

                         ALI
          Yep.

          74. EXT. BEACH - ROAD. DAY

          The afternoon sun has the entire coast sparkling. Ali is on
          his moped, with the box between his knees, driving up the
          coastal road. He looks splendid, wearing new clothes.
          He finally sees what he was looking for: a group on the
          beach, Anna, Richard and their neighbors, having a picnic.

                         CUT TO:

          75. EXT. BEACH. DAY

          CU Ali and Anna are off to one side, talking.

                         ANNA
          You see what you're like with him? You're
          not around and when you are, you scream at
          him. Damn, you hit him! Why did you take him
          along if you act like that? You should have
          left him.

                         ALI
          Cut the shit. He's not dead. I didn't do it
          on purpose. I'm sorry about it.
          Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls
          out the envelope of money and hands it to her.

                         ALI
          Here.

                         ANNA
          What's that?

                         ALI
          Money. What I owe you plus the next few

                         65

                         

                         

                         

                         
          months. You can count it.
          She looks at the bills.

                         ANNA
          Where did you get this? (pointing to his new
          clothes) Same place?

                         ALI
          I won a fight.

                         ANNA
          A fight? What kind of fight? Is that the
          only job you could find?
          Is that why you have marks on your face?

                         ALI
          Hey, will you take the money or not? Why are
          you looking at me that way?

                         ANNA
          Nothing.
          He leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest
          of the group.
          They are packing away ice chests and folding things up. Sam
          and his little friends are playing in the sand with the
          John Deere tractor. Sam has a bandage on his forehead. Ali
          sits down in the sand next to him.

                         ALI
          (pointing to the tractor) You like it?
          Sam continues to play, ignoring him. Behind them, Richard
          is folding up parasols with the help of Che, a bearded
          neighbor who is also there with all his family.

                         RICHARD
          Have you eaten?

                         ALI
          Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

                         CHÃ
          You don't want to drink something before I

                         66

                         

                         

                         

                         
          pack up?
          Ali shakes his head âno'. He looks at Joelle, Che's
          daughter: a tomboy with boobs.

                         ALI
          (to Sam) You want to go for a swim?

          76. EXT. BEACH. DAY

          Ali and JoÃ«lle take turns tossing Sam into the waves. The
          child laughs so hard, he swallows water.
          Ali takes Sam into his arms.

                         ALI
          Give me a kiss.

                         SAM
          I don't want to.

                         ALI
          Give Daddy a kiss!

                         SAM
          No.

                         ALI
          (using a deep voice) Give Daddy a kiss!

                         SAM
          (deep voice too)... No!
          Ali kisses him and hugs him tight.

          77. INT. JOELLE'S ROOM. EVENING

          A nearby house. Evening is falling. Ali and JoÃ«lle make
          love in her bedroom. His cell phone rings. The screen
          reads: "Stef". He doesn't answer. JoÃ«lle comes noisily. Ali
          puts his hand over her mouth.
          Through the window, we see Sam in Anna's garden, playing
          with his new tractor. Richard is hanging towels and swim
          suits on the line to dry.

                         67

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. EVENING

          Sitting on the couch in a T-shirt and boxers, Stephanie
          finishes her dinner, watching TV distractedly.
          Balancing on her stumps, she puts her plate in the
          dishwasher. Then, supporting herself on her hands, she
          leaves the kitchen, wiggling her way into the bedroom. She
          lifts herself into bed as best she can.
          Evening falls over the bougainvilleas. Stephanie watches
          old people coming home in their wheelchairs or hanging on
          to their Zimmer frames.

          79. INT. FORMULE 1 - HOTEL ROOM. DAY

          Ali walks up a long standard hotel corridor lined with
          numbered doors. He stops and knocks at room 429.
          No answer. He knocks again. Finally, room 431 opens behind
          him. Martial looks out.

                         MARTIAL
          Hey! I'm here.

                         ALI
          They told me 429.
          Martial motions him in.

                         MARTIAL
          Normal. This one is for the equipment.
          Boxes of equipment are piled up under the window and the
          small table has been converted into a work surface. A
          camera is plugged into the TV set. It shows a still
          picture: an empty location, one sector of an industrial
          site filmed from above.

                         MARTIAL
          I have to watch this. Have a seat.
          You wanted to see me.
          Ali sits on the edge of the bed. Martial watches the screen
          out of the corner of his eye.

                         68

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          I need to find a coach. A real one. Someone
          who has me work on my takedowns.

                         MARTIAL
          Foued?

                         ALI
          Foued doesn't know jackshit. Just jiu-jitsu
          and rap stuff. You need to ask Cousin. His
          guys must train somewhere.

                         MARTIAL
          Think so?

                         ALI
          Yeah. And I'll need some time to train.

                         MARTIAL
          I'll talk with Alta Secu. We'll be able to
          work something out.

                         ALI
          Work it out how?

                         MARTIAL
          I'll have my company pay you and I'll bill
          them what you cost me. They'll keep paying
          you but now you'll work directly for me. You
          won't have to spend your nights there.
          There is some movement on the screen. He interrupts
          himself. Gray silhouettes cross the screen, open a door and
          disappear before coming back to cross the screen once
          again.

                         ALI
          Where's that?

                         MARTIAL
          At the Mousquetaires.
          Martial rewinds and zooms in on some faces.

                         MARTIAL
          I'll make a copy and you'll take it to the

          owner. Ask for Steve at Security. He'll tell
          you what to do.

          80. INT. RICHARD'S TRUCK. DAY

          Sam is on Richard's lap, âdriving' the truck. He is in
          seventh heaven. In front of them, a man is running down the
          shoulder of the road.

                         RICHARD
          Look who it is! Go on, honk!

          81. EXT. ROAD. DAY

          The horn beeps. Out of breath, in a sweat, Ali looks back
          and sees Richard and Sam in the truck. They slow down and
          pull up to him. Richard lowers his window.

                         RICHARD
          We're going to school. Want to come along?
          Ali shakes his head and continues jogging. The truck
          disappears.

          82. INT. NEW GYM. DAY

          This new gym is large, clean and light. In one corner there
          is a genuine ring, and on the other side, a piece of
          tatami.
          Ali is working out with Joao, a Brazilian in a kimono. They
          try out some foot-fist series. On the mat, Ali shadows and
          deconstructs Joao's gestures.

          83. EXT. ANTIBES. STREET. DAY

          A street near the beach. The weekend is beginning. The
          streets are crowded. Ali is on the phone.

                         ALI
          Where are you? I can't see you. Where?
          He looks every which way until he sees her, a few feet
          away. She is standing upright, in a light pair of pants,
          with her canes hidden behind her back. It takes some time
          to register. She smiles at him.

                         70

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          That's fucking amazing! I was looking for a
          wheelchair...

                         STEPHANIE
          Stop looking. No more wheelchairs!

                         ALI
          Since when?

                         STEPHANIE
          Two days.

                         ALI
          You could have told me!

                         STEPHANIE
          Why? Is it a problem?

                         ALI
          No, I don't know. You're like before.

                         STEPHANIE
          Well, not exactly.

                         ALI
          Go on, let's see.
          She takes a few steps forward, leaning on her canes. He
          whistles in admiration.

                         STEPHANIE
          I need to get my balance but supposedly that
          doesn't take long.

                         ALI
          It must be like walking on stilts...

                         STEPHANIE
          I don't know. I've never walked on stilts
          before.

                         ALI
          You look taller. Does it hurt?

                         71

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          A little, but it feels good too.

                         ALI
          Want to go for a swim?
          She stops.

                         STEPHANIE
          The beach... pff, I don't know... It's
          different today... I don't think I want to
          get undressed.

          84. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN. DAY

          They are at the kitchen table, eating salad. Stephanie is
          in her wheelchair. Ali has finished his plate.

                         ALI
          Is this all you have?

                         STEPHANIE
          Look in the fridge. There must be some
          cheese left.

                         ALI
          You don't have any pate?

                         STEPHANIE
          No, I don't have any pate.
          He gets up and opens the fridge. He takes the cheese,
          sniffs it, then takes some yoghurt too. He notices a box of
          cereal on a shelf and takes it. He returns to the fridge
          for some milk. She watches, her mouth open in suspense.

                         STEPHANIE
          You're a good eater, aren't you?

                         ALI
          I'm hungry.
          He begins with the cheese.

                         ALI
          No bread?

                         72

                         

                         

                         

                         
          She shakes her head "no" and points to a box of biscuits on
          the shelf.

                         STEPHANIE
          There are crackers up there. Do you have a
          girlfriend?
          He shakes his head.

                         STEPHANIE
          You don't have anyone?

                         ALI
          Yes, but they're not girlfriends.

                         STEPHANIE
          What are they? Quick fucks?

                         ALI
          Yeah.
          She hesitates.

                         STEPHANIE
          A lot?
          He looks at her.

                         STEPHANIE
          You mind talking about this?

                         ALI
          No, I don't care. (pause) How about you? Did
          you have a lot of boyfriends?

                         STEPHANIE
          When, before?

                         ALI
          Yeah.

                         STEPHANIE
          I was with Simon...

                         ALI
          That's all?

                         73

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          No, there were others. But not a lot either.
          I... I wasn't very... In fact, I liked it
          when guys looked at me... I liked to feel
          that I turned them on... Afterwards, I don't
          know... they bored me.
          Ali looks at her, strangely attentive, as if he didn't
          understand, or didn't believe her.

                         ALI
          And now?

                         STEPHANIE
          Um, nothing. I don't even know what it looks
          like anymore... I don't even know if it
          still works...

                         ALI
          You don't want to?

                         STEPHANIE
          Did I say I didn't want to anymore? Of
          course I still want to...

                         ALI
          How do you go about it?

                         STEPHANIE
          How do you think I go about it? If I were a
          guy I'd say I jerk off to a porn video...
          I'm a girl.
          Ali is dumbstruck.

                         STEPHANIE
          Okay, let's change the subject...
          She begins piling up plates and silverware.

                         ALI
          You want to fuck?
          She is thrown for a loop.

                         STEPHANIE
          Huh?

                         74

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          You want to know if it still works, so let's
          fuck and that way you'll know.
          He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous
          laugh.

                         STEPHANIE
          Just like that?

                         ALI
          Um, yeah. Give me that.
          He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the
          dishwasher.

                         STEPHANIE
          I... I don't know if I can like that...

                         ALI
          Whatever you want... You tell me...
          She hesitates.

                         STEPHANIE
          Wait.
          She wheels herself away from the table and into the
          bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table.

                         ALI
          What do I do?

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          Wait!
          He waits. Then:

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          Come here.

          85. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM. DAY

          He enters the room. The shutters are closed. She is in bed,
          under the covers. She watches him sit down on the bed, undo

                         75

                         

                         

                         

                         
          his pants and turn toward her.

                         ALI
          Okay? Ready?
          Unsure of herself, she pulls a face.

                         STEPHANIE
          Let's try.
          He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her,
          but she pushes him away gently.

                         STEPHANIE
          (a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't
          kiss?

                         ALI
          No. Your breasts... can I?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes.
          He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering
          her. She tries to wriggle herself free.

                         STEPHANIE
          You're crushing me!

                         ALI
          Maybe you should stop talking now...

                         STEPHANIE
          Okay, I'll stop.
          His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her
          thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets
          herself go.
          She grabs hold of him.

                         STEPHANIE
          Gently!

                         76

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN. DAY

          Ali opens the fridge. He is dressed again. Stephanie
          appears in a robe, sitting in her wheelchair. We can tell
          she feels too shy to look at him.

                         ALI
          Are you okay? How was it?
          She blushes.

                         ALI
          Is it still working?

                         STEPHANIE
          Um, yes... no... I don't really know. It's
          different... It's hard to tell after just
          one try...

                         ALI
          Yeah but I don't have time right now. I have
          to go!

                         STEPHANIE
          (blushing) No, no! That's not what I
          meant... I just meant that it's too soon to
          tell... like too many things are happening
          at once...
          Ali doesn't understand.

                         ALI
          But did you enjoy it or not?

                         STEPHANIE
          I did.
          A beat.

                         ALI
          When you're up for it and you can't find
          anyone, ask me. If I'm oper, we'll do it.

                         STEPHANIE
          What's "oper"?

                         77

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Operational... If I'm available. If I can, I
          mean!

                         STEPHANIE
          If you're "oper" we...

                         ALI
          Yeah.
          She sketches a vague gesture.

                         ALI
          What?
          Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer.

                         STEPHANIE
          Nothing. Great.

          87. EXT. MARINELAND - STAFFROOM. DAY

          Stephanie uses one of her canes to push open the door to
          the staff room. The room is apparently empty.

                         STEPHANIE
          Louise? Louise, are you here? Is anyone
          here?
          No answer.
          She looks over the office she once knew so well and that
          hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the
          wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names,
          etc...

          88. EXT. MARINELAND - BLEACHERS. DAY

          Up in the bleachers, Stephanie looks over all the pools,
          the big one as well as the others... suddenly, in nÂ° 3, a
          huge but limp black dorsal fin appears.

          89. EXT. POOL N3. DAY

          Weighed down by her prostheses, Stephanie has to lie down
          on the rim of pool nÂ° 3 to reach the water. She reaches out
          and slaps the water with the palm of her hand. Nothing

                         78

                         

                         

                         

                         
          really happens, a black mass just keeps circling at the
          bottom of the pool... She slaps again and the black mass
          swims faster and faster... a wave is formed around the
          sides of the pool, a wave that swells higher and higher...
          Stephanie's hand again slaps the water and, suddenly, Niska
          emerges.

                         CUT TO:

          90. EXT. POOL N3 - DAY

          Niska washes up. Stephanie caresses her and weeps softly,
          like someone caught unawares.

                         LOUISE (OFF)
          (gently) Stephanie?
          Stephanie looks back to discover Louise and three other ex-
          colleagues. They have been there a moment, surprised,
          unsettled and ill at ease.

                         STEPHANIE
          I stopped by the office but there wasn't
          anyone.
          Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes. The guys
          rush over to help her. They hug and kiss. All four remain
          like that for a moment.

          91. EXT. MARINELAND - CAFETERIA. DAY

          Sun and music. The public is beginning to invade the lanes
          and paths.
          Stephanie, Louise and the other keepers are on the terrace
          of the employees' cafeteria. They are thrilled and
          reassured to see her again. At times a hand touches her
          arm or shoulder. Sometimes an acquaintance comes over and
          kisses her.
          Under the table, Stephanie types âoper?' into her cell
          phone, then looks up and returns to her surroundings.
          We can imagine the "How are you?" "And you?" "Great". The
          "Let me get a look at you... You look wonderful!"...all a

                         79

                         

                         

                         

                         
          bit strained, but friendly. Louise, who is sitting next to
          her, leans over to her:

                         LOUISE
          (softly) See? It wasn't hard!
          They smile at each other and return to the conversation in
          progress. Stephanie's cell phone vibrates on the table. She
          discreetly checks the answer, and when she looks up,
          exchanges a glance with Louise.
          From that glance, we cut to:

          92. INT. SUPERMARKET. DAY

          Stephanie and Louise are out shopping. Stephanie holds
          herself up thanks to the shopping cart she is pushing. We
          join their conversation already in progress.

                         STEPHANIE
          When I feel like it, I send him a text
          message and ask if he's oper. If he is, we
          hook up.
          Louise reacts.

                         LOUISE
          What's oper?

                         STEPHANIE
          If he's up for it. If he's free. If he is,
          we fuck.

                         LOUISE
          Is that all?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes, that's all. What else do you want?

                         LOUISE
          I don't know. Is that enough?

                         STEPHANIE
          For me it is.

                         80

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LOUISE
          What does he do?
          Stephanie hesitates a moment, as if worried about how
          Louise will react.

                         STEPHANIE
          He fights.

                         LOUISE
          What kind? MMA?

                         STEPHANIE
          No. Illicit fights in the projects.
          Louise reacts.

                         STEPHANIE
          Whatever I say, you make a face.

                         LOUISE
          Just give me a second to react... Are you in
          love?
          She hesitates.

                         STEPHANIE
          He does me good.

          93. EXT. PARKING LOT. MARINELAND. DAY

          The group of trainers has accompanied Stephanie to a taxi.

          94. INT. TAXI/PARKING LOT - MARINELAND. DAY

          Stephanie waves good-bye. They return her wave.
          The taxi drives away. The group scatters.

                         CUT TO:

          95. INT. BASEMENT. DAY

          A dark cellar. We hear Ali and Stephanie labor and sigh. A
          door suddenly opens above and we hear voices.

                         81

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Shit!

                         STEPHANIE
          Who is it?
          He looks for his clothes...

          96. EXT. GARDEN. DAY

          ... then goes to the garden where he startles Anna:

                         ANNA
          I didn't know you were here. You scared me.
          What were you up to?

                         ALI
          I was talking?

                         ANNA
          You're not alone?

                         ALI
          I'm with a friend.

                         ANNA
          You bring girls back to my place now?

                         ALI
          She's a friend, I said.
          Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on
          her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie:

                         ALI
          (to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my
          sister! (to Anna) This is Stephanie. You
          know the girl from Marineland.
          Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then
          realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth:

                         ANNA
          Oh, my God. Poor thing!

                         82

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Sam arrives with his snack. Stephanie looks at him.

                         STEPHANIE
          So that's him?
          They are sitting around the garden table. Anna comes
          carrying a tray.

                         ANNA
          They were out of grapefruit. I took tropical
          fruit.
          She puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on
          the table. Through a hole in the oilcloth, Stephanie can
          watch Sam playing under the table.

                         ANNA
          I'll make tea. I have some cookies. You
          drink tea, don't you?

                         STEPHANIE
          Don't bother. This is perfect, I swear.
          Thanks.
          Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the
          way back to the kitchen.

                         ALI
          You don't want to get going?

                         STEPH
          Wait, your sister...

                         ALI
          You freak her out. Can't you see? She feels
          like a cashier with you. Pathetic with her
          tea and cookies. It's a pain.
          Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up.

                         ALI
          What are you doing?

                         STEPH
          I'm going to help her.

                         83

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          No need to overdo it.

          97. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE. DAY

          Later, Sam guides Stephanie up the narrow stairs of the
          house. She has a hard time with her âlegs' and canes.

          98. INT. SAM'S ROOM. DAY

          A child's room with cheap wall paper depicting dolphins.
          Stephanie is sitting on the edge of the bed.

                         STEPHANIE
          So this is where you sleep? It's a nice
          room.
          Sam nods in agreement. He gives her a strange look.

                         STEPHANIE
          Why are you looking at me like that? Does it
          scare you? You want to see them, is that it?
          He nods.
          She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis
          underneath. Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand,
          touches it carefully.

                         SAM
          Does it hurt?
          Stephanie smiles at him.

                         STEPHANIE
          No... Want to touch it?
          Sam reaches out his hand.

          99. INT. MARTIAL'S CAR. DAY

          In CU through the tinted windows of Martial's Mercedes
          Vito: the face of a boxer who is lying on the ground and
          being pummeled.
          Ali is sitting bare-chested in the back seat, a towel
          around his neck and a bottle of water between his knees.

                         84

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ali watches the fight. Sitting next to him, Stephanie fills
          a plastic bag with ice cubes. She hands it to him.

                         STEPHANIE
          Here.
          He applies it to his eyebrow. She displaces a bloody strand
          of hair and replaces it with another.
          We see Martial return to the car and open the front door.

                         MARTIAL
          You okay?
          He puts a wad of money in the glove compartment.

                         MARTIAL
          You ready?
          Ali nods âyes'. He opens his door, gets half out and
          empties the bottle of water over his head.
          Stephanie is left alone in the car. She hears the
          spectators' cheers. She closes the window and turns on the
          air conditioning full blast.

          100. EXT. PROJECTS - COURTYARD. DAY

          His opponent's guard is up, closed tighter than a safe.
          Behind his fists, Ali can see the guy's frozen stare. And
          then suddenly he breaks loose: a series of feints and a
          kick behind the ear.
          He hears himself growl, the light becomes electrifying. He
          is on the ground, protecting himself as best he can. He
          tries to block his opponent's arm. He hears himself
          wheezing and panting like a pair of bellows. He sees his
          blood splatter his opponent.

                         ALI (OFF)
          ... All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's
          like it tasted like bone. A taste of rust
          and bone.

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          Because you think bone has a taste?

                         85

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI (OFF)
          Yeah, there I did.
          Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something:
          sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just
          opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a
          pair of shortsâ¦ He also sees the heads of the tough guys
          who turn back to look.
          He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of
          blood and returns to the task at hand.
          His opponent tries to get up. Ali jumps on him to finish

                         HIM OFFÂ¦

          101. INT. MARTIAL'S CAR. DAY

          The car is driving back into town. Martial is driving. The
          windows are open. Ali holds a bag of ice against his cheek
          bone, while Stephanie applies her Band-Aids to a cut over
          his eyebrows. They are talking, but we can not hear what
          they say. All we hear is the noise of the wind against the
          open windows. Ali suddenly breaks out laughing. Martial
          does too in the rear view mirror. Stephanie follows suitâ¦

          102. INT. MOUSQUETAIRES. DAY

          Muzak.
          Ali and Martial follow the head of security into the store.
          Some of the personnel are near the cash registers, silent,
          hostile and immobile. The morning customers wonder what's
          happening.
          The head of security elbows his way through.

          HEAD OF SECURITY
          Let them through, please!
          The personnel reluctantly make way.

          103. INT. MOUSQUETAIRES - STOCKROOM. DAY

          Red graffiti on the wall: "A SPYING BOSS IS A CRIMINAL

          BOSS!"

                         86

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ali recognizes the place with the palettes up to the
          ceiling. In the back, he also recognizes the manager,
          protected by two guards and being harangued by union
          representatives.

                         MARTIAL
          (to Ali, pointing to the manager) Go get the
          equipment. I need to see him.
          Ali obeys.

                         UNION REP
          Don't bother. We're the ones who will call
          the police. The police and the press. That
          way they'll know you spy on your workers!
          The manager looks away, accompanied by his two guards.

                         UNION REP
          At least have the courage to look at me when
          I talk to you!

                         CUT TO:
          The cameras, the ripped out cables, the phony boxes have
          been piled up on the floor. It looks more like the crime
          squad has been at work. Ali opens a garbage bag and bends
          over to retrieve the equipment.

                         WOMAN (OFF)
          What are you doing there?
          She's a young employee in the store uniform.

                         ALI
          (suspicious) Packing up.

                         WOMAN
          Is it your stuff?

                         ALI
          No.
          He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a
          picture.

                         87

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Don't you take a picture!

                         WOMAN
          You work for them?
          She continues to manipulate her phone.

                         ALI
          I said no picture!

                         WOMAN
          Why shouldn't I? You film us!
          He straightens up menacingly.

                         ALI
          I'm going to slap you!
          A hand grabs his arm. It's Martial.

                         MARTIAL
          Forget it. Let's get out of here!

                         ALI
          And the equipment?

                         MARTIAL
          Forget about it. We're fucked here. The cops
          are going to question the managers and the
          managers will turn us in.
          They leave.

          104. INT. MARTIAL'S FORMULE 1 ROOM. NIGHT

          Martial's fingers slowly play with the hair on his chest.
          He is lying nude on the bed of his Formule 1 hotel room. He
          smokes and stares at the ceiling. His suitcases and bags
          are packed, all he has to do is close them.
          He hears knocks next door. He gets up with a sigh, pulls on
          his pants and opens the door. Stephanie is waiting in front
          of room 429.

                         88

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARTIAL
          In here.
          Stephanie looks back, surprised. Martial motions her in.

                         MARTIAL
          I have to go away for work. 3 or 4 months, I
          don't know yet... Since Ali wants to keep
          fighting, I thought maybe you tend to that
          while I'm not here...
          She is thunderstruck.

                         STEPHANIE
          Is he okay with that?

                         MARTIAL
          He's the one who asked me to call you.

                         STEPHANIE
          Why me?

                         MARTIAL
          I guess he trusts you.

                         STEPHANIE
          (laughs, thrown for a loop) Yes, sure
          but.... I don't know anything about that
          scene... I don't know those guys!
          He hands her an old spiral notebook.

                         MARTIAL
          I wrote it all down here. As for the rest,
          ask me your questions and I'll answer them.

                         STEPHANIE
          How do I do the bets?

                         MARTIAL
          You can count on your fingers, can't you?

                         STEPHANIE
          Honestly, can you see me dealing with those
          beasts?

                         89

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARTIAL
          Yeah.
          A beat.

                         MARTIAL
          And you need money to cover the bets, and
          you have money.
          She looks at him.

                         MARTIAL
          What? You're not rich? What did the
          insurance company give you for your legs?
          200,000? 300,000? Those jobs must have good
          health plans. Am I wrong?

                         STEPHANIE
          No.
          A shadow crosses Stephanie's mind. She looks at the open
          bags and suitcases, without really seeing them. The place
          looks like it's expecting a police raid.

                         STEPHANIE
          Where are you going?

                         MARTIAL
          Grenoble, then Vienne.

                         STEPHANIE
          Austria?

                         MARTIAL
          No, in the IsÃ¨re.

                         STEPHANIE
          Was the insurance money your idea?

                         MARTIAL
          Yes.
          A beat. He gives her time to wrap her head around that one.
          Then, since she still looks troubled, he taps her on the
          hand.

                         90

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARTIAL
          It's me, I said. Don't worry. I'm the bad
          guy.

          105. EXT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT

          Through the door of the club, we hear snatches of the
          introduction to Thunderstruck.
          People are sweating and trying to get into the Fever. Foued
          lets Martial, Ali, Stephanie and Khadi through. Virile bear
          hugs and handshakes.

                         FOUED
          The Cousin's waiting for you inside. Table
          to the left of the bar.
          Ali knows and greets everyone. Stephanie is in the middle
          of the group. She holds herself up on the shoulders of
          these big, caring guys and lets herself be carried along.
          She feels good

          106. INT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT

          The club is hot as a steam bath. Loud music blares out of
          loudspeakers. Bodies dance and eyes shine bright.
          At the table "left of the bar": Cousin and three friends
          who are with him. Another round of bear hugs and
          handshakes. Martial, Stephanie and Cousin regroup face to
          face. Martial speaks, Cousin listens and at times looks
          over at Stephanie, who looks at him too. She notices one of
          the tattoos on his arm: a green and red snake that seems to
          be slithering out his sleeve. The barman brings two bottles
          of champagne.
          Ali leans toward her:

                         ALI
          Want to boogie?
          She doesn't understand.

                         ALI
          (loud) You want to dance?

                         91

                         

                         

                         

                         
          She looks frightened, but then smiles when she sees what
          he's up to.

                         ALI
          Come on!

                         STEPHANIE
          No, no!

                         ALI
          Whatever you say.
          He goes to the dance floor and begins to rock. He dances
          badly, clumsily. Martial pours champagne.

          107. EXT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT

          The smoking area is located outside, and a bit farther off,
          the dope smoking area. Behind the smokers, we hear noise
          from the club. Cousin is puffing on a spliff. Stephanie
          watches, holding her champagne goblet. He offers it to
          her. She accepts and takes a drag.

                         COUSIN
          Can I talk to you?
          She nods "yes".

                         COUSIN
          There's something I'd like to know... The
          fish that ate your legs...
          She wasn't expecting that.

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes?

                         COUSIN
          Is it true it's still there?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yeah... where else would it be?

                         COUSIN
          They didn't shoot it? Or put it down,
          whatever?

                         92

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          Why would they do that?

                         COUSIN
          I don't know... when a dog attacks you, they
          kill it. And the fish gets off. Don't you
          mind that the thing that ate your legs is
          living it up in its shitty fucking aquarium?

                         STEPHANIE
          No. And I don't want anything to happen to
          it. Now more than ever!
          He looks at her, incredulous, but with admiration.

                         COUSIN
          (imitating her) "Now more than ever". Listen
          to you!
          He takes another drag.

                         COUSIN
          (imitating her) Tututu-tu-tutu...
          They laugh.

                         STEPHANIE
          Do I sound like that?

                         COUSIN
          Tututu...

          108. INT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT

          We are back inside. Ali is working on a girl a bit farther
          off on the dance floor. Stephanie follows Cousin through
          the noise and sticky heat. When she next looks at the dance
          floor, Ali is no longer there.
          Ali and the girl are on their way to the exit. Ali looks
          for a friendly face, meets Stephanie's glance and motions
          that he's leaving. She waves: "Yeah, ok, I get it."
          Ali disappears with the girl.
          Stephanie is at the bar, drinking. She types an SMS into
          her cell phone: "operational?" She hesitates, then puts

                         93

                         

                         

                         

                         
          away her cell phone. She hadn't noticed a guy sitting next
          to her. She also failed to notice that he's been speaking
          to her for a while now.

                         STEPHANIE
          (loud) Huh? I can't hear you...

                         GUY
          (loud) No problem. What are you drinking?

                         STEPHANIE
          (loud) Champagne?
          The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He
          might be thought to resemble Simon.

                         GUY
          What's your name? I'm Pierre.

                         STEPHANIE
          Hey there. I'm Marie.

                         GUY
          Come here often?
          Stephanie is on automatic pilot. When she turns to the
          room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her. She
          can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts
          under her T-shirt. She answers his questions, she returns
          his smiles. When she finishes her glass and puts it down on
          the counter, he kisses her. She doesn't push him away
          immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time
          to put a good face on it.

                         STEPHANIE
          No... No, please. I don't feel like it. Not
          tonight. I can't...
          The guy looks disappointed, then manages a âgood loser's'
          smile.

                         GUY
          Okay, no problem...

                         STEPHANIE
          It's best I go. Good night and thanks.

                         94

                         

                         

                         

                         
          He sees her lean over to retrieve her canes and then hobble
          away.

                         GUY
          Sorry. I couldn't know.
          Stephanie freezes.

                         STEPHANIE
          You couldn't know what?

                         GUY
          Huh?

                         STEPHANIE
          You couldn't know what, asshole?
          Foued runs to warn Martial, Khadi and Cousin that something
          is wrong.
          When Martial arrives, he sees Stephanie collared by a
          bouncer three times her size. She lashes out with one of
          her canes, while under the bar, another bouncer tries to
          help the blond guy back to his feet. There's a deep gash on
          his skull.
          Cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand.

          109. EXT. ANTIBES - BEACH -CAFÃ. DAY

          Early morning. The shrill screech of the sea gulls and the
          milky light of a day that looks like it's going to be
          sunless.
          Stephanie drinks her coffee at the only table on the
          terrace. Behind her, chairs are still piled up and the
          waiter is slowly getting to work.
          A silhouette appears on the sidewalk. It's Ali, in the same
          clothes as last night. He joins her and takes a seat.

                         ALI
          You okay?

                         STEPHANIE
          Fine.

                         95

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Did you stay late?

                         STEPHANIE
          I can't remember. Afterwards the cousin took
          us to a club at la Colle sur Loup... It
          sucked and it was 5 a.m. And you?

                         ALI
          Normal. (to the waiter) A large coffee with
          milk and bread with butter!
          A beat.

                         STEPHANIE
          You think it's good that we're having this
          conversation?

                         ALI
          What conversation?

                         STEPHANIE
          That I ask how it was with the girl last
          night and you answer normal.

                         ALI
          What do you want me to say?

                         STEPHANIE
          Nothing.
          He grimaces at her mood.

                         ALI
          Oh la!

                         STEPHANIE
          "Oh la" what? You think it's normal leaving
          with that bimbo in front of me? What would
          you say if I did the same thing?

                         ALI
          Nothing.

                         STEPHANIE
          Oh yeah? You wouldn't care?

                         96

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          You're pissing me off. What's your problem?

                         STEPHANIE
          Wait, let me put it differently. What I am
          for you? A friend? A pal?
          Sort of a buddy, like Foued and the others?

                         ALI

                         STEPHANIE
          Tell me something: do you and your buddies
          fuck every now and then?
          He snickers.

                         STEPHANIE
          No? Really? Never?
          That's the difference.
          Her looks at her.

                         STEPHANIE
          Dammit, stop looking at me that way!

                         ALI
          How am I looking at you?
          The waiter arrives with Ali's order. She tones her voice
          down a notch.

                         STEPHANIE
          You wanted us to continue... Isn't that what
          you told Martial?

                         ALI
          What are you talking about, fucking or
          fighting?

                         STEPHANIE
          Well, we have to go about it well. We have
          to show each other manners, and
          consideration...

                         ALI
          Manners?

                         97

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          Hey! Stop acting like an idiot. Do the words
          bother you? You know what I mean.... Tact...
          You've never stopped being tactful with me.
          A beat. He looks away.

                         STEPHANIE
          So... is that a plan?
          She waits for his mind to come back before continuing.

                         STEPHANIE
          We'll continue... but not like animals.
          He smirks, with a flick of the chin.

                         STEPHANIE
          Cat got your tongue?
          Ali stirs his cup without answering. He feels her eyes on
          him. He smiles.

                         ALI
          I'm oper now.

                         STEPHANIE
          What?

                         ALI
          You made me oper. It's you! It's because
          it's all you're talking about!

                         STEPHANIE
          (softly) You are really a dog.
          He stands up.

                         STEPHANIE
          What are you doing?

                         ALI
          I'm getting out of here.

                         STEPHANIE
          Why?

                         98

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          I'm fed up.

                         STEPHANIE
          You're bored?

                         ALI
          Yeah.

                         STEPHANIE
          What I'm saying bores you?

                         ALI
          Yeah.

                         STEPHANIE
          Are you acting like a jackass on purpose?

                         ALI
          Aren't you being an ass by putting words
          everywhere?
          He sits back down. She watches him eat his sandwiches.

                         STEPHANIE
          I'm the one who's leaving.
          She gets up.
          Ali finishes his coffee.

          110. INT. TATTOO PARLOR. DAY

          The buzz of a small electric compressor.
          In extreme close up: the needle of a tattoo machine
          pricking skin. Ink flows, a cotton swab wipes... a tattoo
          slowly appears.
          Lying on a table, Stephanie is having what remains of her
          legs tattooed.

                         CUT TO:

                         99

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111. EXT/INT. BANK. DAY

          Stephanie is at a teller's window, withdrawing a rather
          large amount of cash.
          A machine counts out the bills, while the employee stuffs
          wads of them into an envelope.

          112. EXT/INT USED CAR DEALERSHIP. DAY
          Pennants flap in the wind, the pennants of a used car
          dealership.
          CU: car doors opening, automatic gearboxes, Stephanie's
          "feet" testing pedals, bucket seats, backseats, tinted
          windows opening and closing, etc.

          113. INT. PROJECTS - APARTMENT. DAY

          A painting of a lion hunt and, under it, Stephanie and
          Cousin on a couch, talking shop.
          Leaning over a computer and a cell phone, they go over
          potential adversaries.
          Some kids stick their heads in to see what Stephanie looks
          like.

          114. INT. NEW GYM. DAY

          Foued, wearing protective gear, spars with a black
          cruiserweight. The fight is close, the sound of flesh on
          flesh resounds. Outside the ring, Ali cheers Foued on.
          He notices on the other side of the ring a young thin,
          bearded guy in a Lacoste polo shirt buttoned up to his neck
          - Leonardini - who is following the fight with the eye of a
          pro.
          When Ali and Joao are later working out on their bit of
          tatami, Ali sees Foued sitting on a bench, with a towel
          around his neck and talking with Leonardini.

                         FOUED
          He saw me at la Ciotat. We spoke a few times
          on the phone. When he has it in for you, he
          never lets up. Leonardini is well-known.

                         100

                         

                         

                         

                         
          He was a club in Strasbourg with a training
          center. He's taking me on a trial basis for
          three months. If it works out, he'll make
          challenger in the nationals.

          115. INT. LOCKER ROOM - NEW GYM. DAY

          Ali and Foued are off to one side in the locker room.

                         ALI
          So are you going to Strasbourg?

                         FOUED
          What do you think? I'd be an idiot...

                         ALI
          And when are you leaving?
          Leonardini enters the locker room.

                         FOUED
          Mr. Leonardini, this is my buddy Ali. Ali
          Van Versh.
          Leonardini shakes his hand.

                         ALI
          Pleased to meet you.

          116. EXT. PROJECTS - COURTYARD. DAY

          Through the tinted windshield of a Nissan Pathfinder SUV,
          Ali watches Stephanie, wearing a tight T shirt and leaning
          on her cane, talking with Cousin and some bettors. The
          discussion looks intense.
          Stephanie returns to the car. Below her pedal pushers, her
          prostheses sparkle in the sunlight. We hear salacious jibes
          from the surrounding buildings.
          She opens the car door.

                         ALI
          How much is there?

                         101

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          3400. Are you ready?
          Walking with a slow, deliberate sway - aware of the effect
          she's having - she ceremonially opens the passenger door.
          The remarks cease.

          117. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT / DAWN

          CU: a black and red arrow with, in industrial characters:

          "RIGHT".
          It's the tattoo on Stephanie's right thigh. Ali's hand
          grips and squeezes the thigh. They are making love.
          The room is half-lit. Ali growls and grinds his teeth in
          his sleep. Stephanie slowly and noiselessly rolls over to
          her side of the bed. She gets up and, using her hands,
          drags herself toward the bathroom.
          Suddenly, feeling like he's suffocating, Ali awakens. It
          takes a few seconds for him to realize where he is. His
          hand sweeps across the bed.

                         ALI
          Where are you?

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          Here.
          He sits up. She is embarrassed.

                         STEPHANIE
          No, don't look!

                         ALI
          What are you doing?

                         STEPHANIE
          I'm going to pee.

                         ALI
          Is it early?

                         STEPHANIE
          Five.

                         102

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Shit, I collapsed...
          Ali slips out of bed, naked, yawning and groggy. He comes
          and leans over her...

                         STEPHANIE
          I don't like it when you see me like this...

                         ALI
          Hold on.
          She hangs onto his neck. He lifts her up and, both naked,
          he carries her into the bathroom.

          118. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM. DAWN

          Stephanie is sitting on the toilet, while Ali pees in the
          shower.

                         STEPHANIE
          I called the numbers they gave me at the
          gym. I spoke to an organizer, GÃ¼nther Bower.
          She yawns.

                         STEPHANIE
          There's a gala in Turin next week. He told
          me that we'd have time to meet there. I'm
          going to go.

                         ALI
          Yeah. And when do I see him?

                         STEPHANIE
          Later, in his gym in Dortmund. He wants to
          organize a test match, to see what you're
          worth. To see if you've got the "GÃ¶ttlicher
          Zorn""...
          Ali comes out of the shower.

                         STEPHANIE
          Turn on the water.

                         103

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Huh?

                         STEPHANIE
          Turn on the water when you pee. It's
          disgusting.
          He runs some water.

          119. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. DAWN

          He carries her back into the bedroom. She looks at his
          face, the scar on his forehead, the scar over his nose.

                         STEPHANIE
          How's your nose?

                         ALI
          Mm.

                         STEPHANIE
          It doesn't seem broken.

                         ALI
          No.
          They look at each other.
          He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her.
          Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places
          her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving.
          She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock.
          She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away,
          surprised.

                         ALI
          Now we're allowed?
          No answer.
          They make love.
          In CU: the tattoo on Stephanie's left thigh. A red and
          black arrow with, in industrial characters: "LEFT".

          120. EXT/INT. NISSAN SUV. DAY

          Music.

                         104

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The road speeds by. Sun. Road signs with the names of
          Italian cities. The landscape has changed.
          Wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses, Stephanie drives
          with her elbow out the window. On the radio, we hear the
          voice of an Italian DJ.

          121. EXT. COASTAL ROAD. DAY

          Ali jogs along the sea shore. He sweats, huffing and
          puffing. He stops, takes a few steps, then continues, but
          soon stops again. It looks as if his feet are weighing him
          down. Traffic speeds by. He stands still and stares into
          the near distance.
          Nothing.

          122. INT. TURIN - HOTEL. EVENING

          A standard hotel lobby.
          Curious, Stephanie looks at the crowd of fighters the day
          before the âUltimate' tournament: muscle-bound giants
          squeezed into tight jackets, with bashed in eyebrows,
          collapsed nostrils, cauliflower ears...
          Every language can be heard, some greet each other, some
          hug, they all size each other up...

                         CUT TO:
          Propped up on her cane, she heads for a table in a corner
          of the bar where a man is consulting his cell phone.

                         STEPHANIE
          (in German) Mr. Bower?

                         GÃNTHER
          (in German) Yes?

                         STEPHANIE
          (in German) I'm Stephanie Granget.
          GÃ¼nther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of
          those years in the ring.

                         CUT TO:

                         105

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Settled in a corner in front of their open PCs, Stephanie
          and GÃ¼nther talk shop.

                         CUT TO:
          They are about to separate.

                         STEPHANIE
          (in German) Can you get me a ticket for
          tonight?

                         GÃNTHER
          (in German) I don't know. I'll see what I
          can do. (pointing to her legs) What happened
          to your legs?

                         STEPHANIE
          An accident. In another life. I was an
          animal trainer. I worked with orcas... The
          show took a turn for the worse.

                         GÃNTHER
          (it dawns on him) Oh, of course! In France!
          The accident! It was you?! I'm talking to a
          star!
          Stephanie makes a face.

                         GÃNTHER
          Yes, I am... Amazing. What courage! Bravo!
          I'm very honored, really. I was an idiot
          before!

                         STEPHANIE
          Why?

                         GÃNTHER
          I acted like an arrogant business man. I'm
          so ashamed. Will you forgive me?

                         STEPHANIE
          Of course, Mr. Bower.

                         GÃNTHER
          Call me GÃ¼nther. Of course you can come
          tonight. As my guest!

                         106

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123. INT. TURIN - GYM. NIGHT

          Bleachers have been set up in a gym, surrounding a cage-
          like, fenced-in ring. Inside, combatants fight, no rules,
          no holds barred.
          On the floor, two wrestlers clasp and elbow each other.
          One is bleeding from the forehead.
          Below the ring, Stephanie is mesmerized by this carnival of
          violence.
          GÃ¼nther leans toward her:

                         GÃNTHER
          (in German) Funny, huh?

                         STEPHANIE
          (in German) What? That?

                         GÃNTHER
          That... and you!

          124. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT

          Stephanie walks down a corridor. She stops in front of a
          door and knocks. GÃ¼nther opens. He looks surprised. He is
          barefoot, in a pair of trousers and an unbuttoned shirt.
          He looks at her inquisitively, and when she still doesn't

                         SAY ANYTHING:
          GÃNTHER (in German)
          Are you okay? Do you need anything?
          She hesitates.
          STEPHANIE (in German)
          I... I came to see if I got it wrong, or
          not.
          He knits his brow.
          GÃNTHER (in German)
          Got what wrong?
          STEPHANIE (in German)
          You don't understand?

                         107

                         

                         

                         

                         
          GÃNTHER (in German)
          Excuse me?
          STEPHANIE (in German)
          I got the impression, the way you were
          looking at me before... Try to understand
          because this is getting hard for me...
          GÃNTHER (in German)
          No, you didn't get it wrong.
          He smiles and opens the door.
          GÃNTHER (in German)
          I have someone in my life, you know.

                         STEPHANIE
          So do I.
          He draws her inside. The door closes.

          125. INT. SUPERMARKET. DAY

          Anna is about to open her cash register, when a West Indian
          in a security uniform whispers into her ear, apparently
          asking her to follow him. Another cashier is already
          waiting to take her place.
          Anna joins three other employees waiting in a corridor.
          They exchange a few words under their breath.

          126. INT. SUPERMARKET - CORRIDOR - ADMINISTRATION. DAY

          Anna comes out of an office, looking distraught. She has to
          lean against the wall to hold herself up. A colleague comes
          to help.

                         COLLEAGUE
          So?

                         ANNA
          I got fired.

                         COLLEAGUE
          Come on. There's something we want to show
          you.

                         108

                         

                         

                         

                         
          In the locker room, we recognize the girl who had
          photographed Ali while he was trying to reclaim Martial's
          camera equipment. The girl says something to Anna. When it
          seems that Anna can not believe her ears, the girl takes
          out her cell phone and confronts her with the evidence.
          Anna needs to sit down.

          127. EXT. HOUSE. DAY

          Out of breath, Ali pushes open the gate and climbs the
          stairs.

          128. INT. KITCHEN. DAY

          In the kitchen, Anna and Richard are sitting at the table
          in front of a meal they haven't had the appetite to start.

                         ALI
          You okay?
          No answer.

                         ALI
          You don't seem it.
          He goes to open the fridge.

                         ANNA
          What are you doing?

                         ALI
          I'm hungry.

                         ANNA
          Close it! Don't eat here.
          Ali stares at her, stunned.

                         ANNA
          Don't eat here.

                         ALI
          What the hell is going on?

                         ANNA
          I was fired this morning. I'm unemployed.

                         109

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Shit... But what's the problem if I eat
          here?
          Anna stands up.

                         ANNA
          They had cameras in the storeroom... They
          filmed us when we took the expired food.
          They fired us.
          Ali's head spins.

                         ANNA
          You had your sister fired. How does it feel?
          How much did you get for that? You get paid
          per person or a flat rate? Nothing to say? I
          take you in, I take care of your son and you
          have nothing to say?

                         ALI
          I couldn't know...

                         ANNA
          You couldn't know? You couldn't know what?
          That you were screwing us out of jobs? That
          you were hurting people?
          Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand
          delivers a resounding slap.
          He takes it like a man. A moment passes. Ali is red from
          the slap, red with shameâ¦ until he suddenly straightens up
          and knocks over the table.

                         RICHARD
          Calm down. Calm down, I said!
          Ali looks back. He sees Richard's grim face at the other
          end of a hunting rifle.

                         RICHARD
          Take your stuff and get out of here. We
          don't want to see you around here anymore.

                         110

                         

                         

                         

                         
          A sudden noise draws their attention: Sam is watching from
          the top of the stairs.

                         ANNA
          Go to your room. Go upstairs immediately.

          129. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - BASEMENT. DAY

          An SMS arrives from Stephanie: âAlmost there. I miss you.â
          Ali is lying on his mattress. He puts down the phone. He
          hears Anna and Richard's voices upstairs. He sits up and
          begins to stuff things into a bag.
          A new message arrives: âI'm home. Oper?â Ali hesitates,
          then turns off his phone and clicks his bag closed.

          130. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - SAM'S ROOM. EVENING

          Night has fallen. Sam's nose is stuck to his bedroom
          window. He sees his aunt sitting at the plastic table in
          the garden downstairs with her face in her hands.
          A door slams. Sam rushes to the bathroom window. He sees
          his father stomp down the street, never once looking back.
          Sam remains glued to the window pane.
          Ali's silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight
          before again disappearing into the dark. Sam watches him
          for as far as he can.
          Fade to black.

          131. INT/ EXT. BASEMENT. DAY

          In the half-light of the basement, a rectangle of light has
          formed where the door opens onto the street. Stephanie
          looks over Ali's mess: his magazines, body building
          equipment, dirty T-shirts, track suits hanging over a
          trestle...
          Anna is standing against the light at the door and, a bit
          farther off, Sam is sitting on the stairs watching them.

                         ANNA
          In his message he said he was in Strasbourg.
          No news since. I don't know what he's doing

                         111

                         

                         

                         

                         
          there, or even if he's still there. Has he
          called you?
          She shakes her head "no".

                         ANNA
          Did you try the gym?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yeah. They don't know.

                         ANNA
          If I had an address or a number, I'd give it
          to you... Even if I think it's dumb. Do you
          believe me?

                         STEPHANIE
          Yes.

                         ANNA
          After what he did to me...
          Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door. She's about to
          leave.

                         ANNA
          He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck
          about anything. All he ever cared about was
          himself. He's totally selfish.
          Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light.

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          You don't know him.

                         ANNA (OFF)
          Me? What did you expect with him?

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          I don't know. Not this.
          Fade to black.
          Black.

                         112

                         

                         

                         

                         

          132. EXT. ALSATIAN COUNTRYSIDE. MORNING

          A frosty landscape with trees that look like they've been
          engraved in ink... A group of twelve joggers in blue track
          suits run across a landscape of gray sky and snow. Some
          shadowbox while running.
          Ali is wearing a wool cap pulled down around his ears. He
          runs alongside Foued.

          133. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE. GYM. DAY

          A ring has been set up in the middle of the gym. A few guys
          have gathered round to watch Ali rhythmically pound on his
          trainer's bear-like paws.
          Leonardini sets the pace.

                         LEONARDINI
          1,2... 1,2,3,4... Faster! 1,2,3. Yes.
          Faster! Move! You're stepping back!
          Ali pounds harder and harder. He times his respiration to
          match the movement of his fists.

          134. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE REC ROOM. EVENING

          Young athletes, some tall, some short, some heavyset, some
          not, are sitting on refectory chairs to watch TV. Ali does
          too. His hair is cut short and his face is closely shaven.
          He looks younger. He could be a student.

          135. EXT. RICHARD'S TRUCK. NIGHT/DAY

          A truck rushes headlong through the countryside. First it
          is day, then night.

          136. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE. DAY

          Through the window, Ali sees a twelve-ton Scania pull to a
          stop at the entrance to the parking lot and beep its horn.
          Ali runs out to meet it.

          137. EXT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE - PARKING LOT. DAY

          Richard lowers his window.

                         113

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RICHARD
          I can't come in any further or I won't be
          able to get back out!
          Ali checks out the huge semi.

                         ALI
          Looks like you changed trucks!

                         RICHARD
          Bosses, in fact. I'm back to being
          exploited.
          Ali doesn't insist. Richard opens his door to let out Sam
          who is already trampling him, trying to get out.

                         RICHARD
          (to Sam) Got everything? Your bag, your
          coat, your hat, your mittens? You haven't
          forgotten anything? Now give me a kiss.
          Sam gives him a kiss. Richard slips him out and into Ali's
          arms.

                         ALI
          How are things there?

                         RICHARD
          They're okay.

                         ALI
          My sister?

                         RICHARD
          She found a job at a school cafeteria. She
          seems to enjoy it.

                         ALI
          Does she know about today?

                         RICHARD
          Yes. She says it's good for the kid.

                         ALI
          Tell her I can't help out for the time being
          but that as soon as I have a little money...

                         114

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RICHARD
          Don't worry. When's your fight?

                         ALI
          Next month. On the 9th.
          Richard smiles admiringly.

                         RICHARD
          Keep us posted if you win.

                         ALI
          Sure I will.

                         RICHARD
          Yeah, right... Okay, I'm off. I'll deliver
          my load in Colmar and pick up the kid at
          around 7, okay?

                         ALI
          Okay.

                         RICHARD
          No later, because I have to be back tomorrow
          at 11.
          The two men say good-bye. Sam waves good-bye.

          138. EXT. ALSATIAN COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

          A path runs through fields and into a clump of fir trees.
          Ali pulls a plastic sled with Sam on top. Whenever there is
          a slope, he lets Sam glide down it and runs after him.
          Snow falls from the trees. He looks up and sees a couple of
          squirrels jump from branch to branch. Sam has never seen
          any before. Ali neither.
          Sunlight filters through the branches. A group of cross-
          country skiers trudges by.

                         SAM
          I want to skate too!

                         115

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          They're not skating. They're skiing.

                         SAM
          No, they're skating.

                         ALI
          They're skiing, I said!

                         SAM
          Skating.
          A few steps on:

                         ALI
          Skiing.

                         SAM
          You're annoying me.
          They take a break at a picnic area, where they eat some
          sandwiches and drink orange soda.

                         ALI
          (his mouth full) Does Auntie still have
          dogs?

                         SAM
          No, now it's chickens.

                         ALI
          In the garden?

                         SAM
          Yeah, in the cage. They lay eggs.

                         ALI
          That's good.

                         SAM
          But Auntie doesn't want me to take the
          chicks in my room.

                         ALI
          She's right. They're disgusting. (pointing
          to his sandwich) Finished? You want some

                         116

                         

                         

                         

                         
          applesauce?
          Afternoon.
          On the way back, they find a frozen pond. Ali carefully
          advances on the ice. He tests it. Jumps on it. Then he
          lets himself go and glides across the ice.

                         ALI
          You can go. But not too far!
          Sam starts slipping and sliding. He falls down. He lies on
          the sled and lets it glide.
          Ali pees behind a tree.
          Sam is far away.

                         ALI
          Come on, we have to head back!

                         SAM
          5 minutes.

                         ALI
          Now!

                         SAM
          (showing his fingers) 5 minutes!

                         ALI
          5 minutes.
          And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He
          tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is
          forming over him.

                         SAM
          Daddy! Daddy!

                         ALI
          Shit!
          Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over. He
          kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole.
          Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks
          everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise,
          blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawls

                         117

                         

                         

                         

                         
          over and clears away snow as best he can. Under the ice, he
          sees Sam's face, staring wide-eyed.
          Ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice, like pistons
          or pestles... As if pounding on his punching bag.

          139. UNDER THE ICE. DAY
          Underwater, we hear the sound of dull thuds. Sam sees his
          father's fists pound on the ice. He sees bloodstains.
          The ice cracks, a bloody fist searches the water for him.
          Sam closes his eyes.

          140. EXT. POND. EVENING

          Evening is falling. Ali has stretched Sam out on the rim of
          the pond. The child has turned blue. He tries mouth-to-
          mouth resuscitation, he massages his heart and rubs him
          down.

          141. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. EVENING

          Ali's respiration has become a grunt, then a groan.
          He runs. He has stowed Sam behind the front of his parka
          and runs as fast as he can. He slips, gets back up and runs
          again... he again breathes into Sam's mouth... while still
          running...

          142. INT. STRASBOURG - HOSPITAL - ICU. DAY

          Leaning against the window of the Intensive Care Unit, Ali
          sees Sam's nude, tiny body being worked on by doctors...
          his skin is blue from the cold... there is a tube in his
          mouth... his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a
          respirator... his mouth spits out brackish water
          brutally...
          A door opens and a nurse appears. Ali straightens up.

                         NURSE
          We'll take care of you. Come with me.
          He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his
          hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred
          fingers, his broken, bloodied hands.

                         118

                         

                         

                         

                         

          143. INT. SAM'S HOSPITAL ROOM. EVENING

          Sam is lying in a hospital bed. His eyes are closed and
          coils of tubes attach him to control apparatus.
          Ali is at his side. His hands are now wrapped in thick
          bandages. The disinfectant makes him look like he is
          wearing yellow gloves halfway up his arms.
          Richard is standing behind him, near the window.
          Ali takes Sam's fingers, places them in the palm of his
          bandaged hand and looks at them.
          Sam's eyes begin to dart wildly under his eyelids... his
          fingers quiver... his eyes open.

          144. INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR. NIGHT

          There are not many people in the corridor at this late
          hour. Richard is bent over a coffee machine. A cup slowly
          fills up. Farther off, Ali is KO, leaning against a wall.
          Richard brings him a coffee. Ali takes it clumsily into his
          damaged hands.
          Richard's cell phone rings. He moves away to answer and
          speaks into it softly. A few moments later, he returns to
          Ali and hands him the phone.

                         RICHARD
          Here. She wants to talk to you.

                         ALI
          Anna?
          Richard shakes his head.

                         ALI
          Hello?

                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
          It's me. (pause) Do you mind?

                         ALI
          No.

                         119

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         STEPHANIE
          How is he?

                         ALI
          Okay. He woke up an hour ago.

                         STEPHANIE
          Is he injured?

                         ALI
          No, I don't think so.

                         STEPHANIE
          And how are you?

                         ALI
          I fucked up my hands on the ice.

                         STEPHANIE
          Is it serious?

                         ALI
          They're broken.
          A beat.

                         ALI
          How are you?

                         STEPHANIE
          I'm okay.

                         ALI
          What are you up to?

                         STEPHANIE
          You mean in general? In my life?

                         ALI
          I wanted to say that...

                         STEPHANIE
          I'm not asking for anything. I'll be going.
          I'll call you back to see how Sam's doing.
          Give him a kiss him from me...

                         120

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ALI
          Don't hang up.

                         STEPHANIE

                         ALI
          Don't hang up!

                         STEPHANIE
          I won't hang up...

                         ALI
          He was in a coma for 3 hours... Three
          hours... For three hours he was dead... I
          was scared to lose him.
          His eyes well with tears.

                         ALI
          Don't leave me.

                         STEPHANIE
          I won't leave you.
          Black.

                         ALI
          I love you.

          145. INT. POLAND. HOTEL ROOM. DAY

          A child sleeps.
          His eyes are darting under his eyelids: vestiges of light
          and shadow, of noise.
          Sam opens his eyes: he is in a hotel room. At the foot of
          the bed, a TV with the sound turned down low is
          broadcasting a cartoon of mice fighting in Polish.
          Stephanie comes and goes, picking up things littering the
          floor and packing their bags.
          Over these images, we hear Ali's voice:
          The human hand contains 27 bones. Some
          monkeys have more: gorillas have 32, five in

                         121

                         

                         

                         

                         
          each thumb. For humans, it's 27.
          If you break an arm or a leg, after a while
          calcium gathers around the bone and joins it
          together. In the end, it's stronger than
          before. But if you break a bone in your
          hand, you know it'll never fully heal.
          You'll think about it before every fight.
          You'll pay attention... And even if you pay
          attention, the pain will come back... like
          needles, like broken glass...
          Ali is wearing a T-shirt. He still bears the marks of
          yesterday's fight. His eyebrows and hands are bandaged.

                         ALI
          Wake up, kiddo. It's over. We're going home.

                         SAM
          Did you win?
          He smiles and kisses his biceps.

          146. INT. POLAND. HOTEL - LOBBY. DAY

          The lobby of a Holiday Inn, the day after an Ultimate
          tournament... (much the same ambience as in Turin) The
          fighters, winners and losers, are about to leave. They
          greet each other, pose for photographers, answer
          interviewers, sign autographs... Ali's hands are still
          bandaged. He is being interviewed along with a kind of
          Viking with a closed eye and broken arm.
          Ali goes to join Stephanie and Sam outside the hotel, where
          a taxi driver is loading their luggage. A young Polish fan
          calls out: "Ali! Ali!" He wants a photo.
          Ali lifts Sam into his arms and pulls Stephanie closer.
          They pose.

                         THE END

 THE S A I N T by Jonathan Hensleigh Director: Phillip Noyce February 8, 1995 New York City The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future. - O. Wilde - FADE IN: The majestic city and bay, as seen from the elevation of the surrounding Shan Ho hills as we SUPER  HONG KONG  1965 PANNING away from the city, we come before the bleak facade of the SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE. BOY'S VOICE (o.s.) Simon Magus was a magician and sorcerer in uhhm... Sumatra. INT. HONG KONG - SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - DAY Twenty boys, aged 7 to 12, sit at spartan desks, bibles raised. FATHER O'NEAL walks amongst them. A career Jesuit with razor eyes and thin lips. An awful man. FATHER 0'NEAL (sternly) Sumeria. And what happened to him Francis? FRANCIS, 12, is the eldest and largest boy. FRANCIS Jesus' disciples came and performed miracles. When Simon Magus saw the miracles he offered disciple Peter gold for the powers of God. FATHER 0'NEAL What did disciple Peter say to that? Michael Quinn? Father O'Neal stands before the youngest, littlest boy, who, unlike the others, exhibits no fear in his huge, intelligent eyes. Father O'Neal hates this boy. The boy, MICHAEL QUINN, doesn't respond. Father O'Neal snatches his bible, revealing a SECOND BOOK hidden behind it. It's a dime store pulp adventure with a gaudy cover entitled "THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR." FATHER 0'NEAL Answer the question Michael. The little boy stares up at him. MICHAEL QUINN That's not my name. Father O'Neal yanks the boy from the chair. Drags him by the arm across the room and out into the corridor. THE OTHER BOYS wait two seconds, then they spring up and run, en masse, to the door. Grouped in the threshold, straining for a good view, they watch as -- FATHER O'NEIL pulls Michael Quinn into an office down the corridor. The door has a stained-glass window. It begins. We see it in SILHOUETTE: Father O'Neal with a CANE SWITCH in his hand, the boy beneath him. Down the switch comes. Again. And again. The boy YELPS. And again and again and again... and now he SCREAMS... THE BOYS HUDDLED IN THE DOORWAY begin to wince. With every repeated, merciless descent of the switch... INT. SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - EATING HALL - NIGHT THE BOYS sit at benches. Michael Quinn stares stoically ahead. The back of his shirt is striped with blood. FATHER YIN, 50's, a Chinese Jesuit, grim in black frock and white collar, paces amongst the benches. Father O'Neal watches from the side. FATHER YIN Why one child is born into a good home and another into poverty - that is but part of God's design. All of you are unwanted, put here because of the sins of your unwedded mothers. The church has fed you and educated you. Given you a home. A name. An identity. Stopping before Michael Quinn, he points to a PORTRAIT ON THE WALL of a stern-faced Jesuit. FATHER YIN Who is that, boy? MICHAEL QUINN Father Michael Quinn. FATHER YIN Yes. A great man. You ungrateful little cur, you will sit here without food until you appreciate your namesake. (to the other boys) All of you will sit with him. Put lunch away, Mr. Fong. MR. FONG, the orphanage cook, wheels a FOOD CART into the kitchen and locks the door. Father Yin exits, followed by Father O'Neal and Mr. Fong, leaving -- A HUNDRED BOYS staring at Michael Quinn. DISSOLVE TO: INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT Again, Father Yin stands before Michael Quinn. The boys are seated for their evening meal. FATHER YIN What is your name, boy? Silence. Michael Quinn stares straight ahead. FATHER YIN Put supper away, Mr. Fong. MR. FONG wheels the FOOD CART into the kitchen and locks the door. Again, a hundred boys stare at Michael Quinn. INT . ORPHANAGE BUNKROOM - NIGHT A long, narrow room with bunkbeds. The boys aren't sleeping. They're grouped around Michael Quinn's bunk. One boy has his hand clamped to Michael's, mouth, the others are wailing on him... and outside -- INT. ORPHANAGE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BUNKROOM - NIGHT Fathers O'Neal and Yin watch through the door. FATHER YIN Spareth the rod, spoileth the child. INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING Father Yin grits his teeth, staring down at Michael Quinn, whose face is welted. Nothing has changed. FATHER YIN Put breakfast away, Mr. Fong. Again, the FOOD CART goes into the kitchen. The Fathers and Mr. Fong exit. The boys rise, moving toward Michael Quinn. They're going to kick the living shit out of him. MICHAEL QUINN Stop. You'll have your breakfast. Michael Quinn walks to the locked kitchen door. The other boys, curious, follow. Michael Quinn kneels before the door, examining the lock. He looks around. On a counter next to the door are EATING UTENSILS. Michael Quinn picks up A FORK. He bends the fork's tines. Inserts it in the lock. He fishes around for a second. Nothing happens. He pulls the fork out, rebends it, and inserts it in the lock again. And CLICK.. ..the lock pops. Michael Quinn turns and smiles. The boys flood inside. The hungry boys go for the food cart, scooping up eggs and sausage. They're ravenous. Francis, mouth full of sausage, beams at Michael Quinn. FRANCIS They should've named you Simon, like Simon Magus the sorcerer. MICHAEL QUINN No. Simon. . . . (pulls the "KNIGHTS TEMPLAR" paperback from his back pocket) ...Templar. Suddenly a SHARP WHISTLE. The boys, startled, whip their necks around. MR. FONG stands in the doorway. Father O'Neal and Father Yin enter quickly. The boys back away from the food cart. FATHER YIN Who.. . who did this...? The boys look at Michael Quinn. Then Francis speaks: FRANCIS I did father. And another boy, James: JAMES I did father. . And another and another: "I did father." They all say it. And the littlest youngest boy, surrounded by his new confederates, smiles slightly. His eyes glint. CUT TO: Begin MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA - NIGHT A chilly September night. A rally is underway in the Dvortsovaya Ploshchad, the vast square at the foot of Nevsky Prospect Boulevard. The Winter Palace and Hermitage loom in the b.g. 500,000 ST. PETERS BURGERS' stand shoulder-to-shoulder, listening to a SPEECH. INTERNATIONAL T.V. CREWS (the BBC, CNN, etc.) are transmitting the event. SPEAKER (o.s.) In I917 Lenin stood here and promised a new age. The result? Tyranny. Poverty. The darkest years in our history. THE SPEAKER stands on a platform behind a cluster of microphones, his image projected on a huge screen (like the Sony screen in Times Square) above and behind him. He is MICHAEL ROMANOV, coal-haired, fierce, ardent, eyes glinting like onyx, voice cutting the night air. ROMANOV In 1987 Gorbachev stood here and promised a new age. The result? An end to communism. Democracy. A free economy. And what else? Chaos. (crowd CHEERS) The economy run by criminals, the government run by charlatans. And they are in league together! Thieves! Traitors! (louder CHEERS) Men and women of St. Petersburg, citizens of Russia, the salt of this country, this must end! (deafening CHEERS) Join me then in the song of our forefathers. Romanov begins to sing, ably, the first verse of "Mother Russia" (the Russian anthem before the Bolsheviks). THE CROWD joins him. The Ploshchad rings with the voices of half a million Russians... CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIKKO HOTEL - CONTINUOUS We're 12 stories up, outside the city's Nikko hotel. The rally across town is a distant glow. We hear the singing crowd. TWO HANDS appear, gripping the nooks of the exterior architecture. A MAN IN BLACK climbs up, securing a sling to the window frame in which to sit. A bulky BACKPACK hangs from shoulder straps. He produces a diamond cutter; begins carving a man-sized aperture in the window. Below, in the foyer  INT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM -- A JAPANESE SECURITY MAN sits at his guard station, watching C.N.N. NEWS on a small television. Wolf Blitzer is reporting live from the rally. WOLF BLITZER (on t.v.) An extraordinary allegation, Bernard, that Russia's present leadership, including President Victor Karpov, is connected with the country's underworld. Inside the foyer ballroom, Japanese businessmen are hosting a reception. The Nikko Hotel's core is hollow, like the Hilton in New York; thus, the ballroom's "ceiling" is 12 stories up. CHAMPAGNE SERVERS are passing out glasses. A grey-haired Japanese businessman, HIRO MYAKI, clinks his glass. The guests pay attention. During this we focus on a CHAMPAGNE SERVER moving toward the lobby elevators with a full tray. HIRO MYAKI Ladies. Gentlemen. The Myaki Corporation looks forward to many profitable days ahead. To our new manufacturing facility in St. Petersburg. To the new Russia! As the crowd CLAPS... EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - EXTERIOR WALL ...the Man In Black kicks at the cut section of window, pushing it into the hotel and plunging inside after it. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE The Man In Black catches hold of a steel girder and dangles, and, miraculously -- THE PIECE OF WINDOW doesn't fall. It's stuck to his feet with suction cups. The Man In Black moves, hand over hand, toward the mezzanine balcony, the window stuck to his feet. IN THE LOBBY BELOW Everybody's beaming, toasting, congratulating, etc., totally oblivious to THE MAN IN BLACK, 12 stories up, inching hand-over-hand across the roof superstructure. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE OVER MEZZANINE The Man In Black has reached the mezzanine. TWO JAPANESE SECURITY GUARDS, armed with automatic rifles, walk their shift directly below him. They pass a wall mounted television, also carrying the NEWS: WOLF BLITZER (on t.v.) One thing's certain, Bernard: Michael Romanov, age 32, French born and Oxford educated, descendent of the last czar, is a political force to be reckoned with. The guards move down the mezzanine; one jokes, the other laughs. They disappear around a corner. The Man in Black hangs from the girder with one hand; with the other he yanks the piece of window off his foot-mounted suction cups. He drops to the mezzanine. He rests the glass against the wall. He peers over the balustrade at the party below. Satisfied, he removes his hood, ENDING TITLES. This is SIMON TEMPLAR. A hard, self-reliant, crafty man. You should treat him as such or be very sorry you ever met him. It is unfortunate that a man of Templar's various talents can be so lacking. How? His journey has been through a tough world and he has come fast. This one gives no quarter. Ever. Though his outward self glows with life, he is dead inside. Templar, focused utterly, steals inside a corridor. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR A long corridor with a door at the end, on which is engraved: MYAKI CORPORATION. At the entrance, secured in a niche, is a BRONZE BUST OF HIRO MYAKI. Templar stops cold. A RUG (an oriental runner) extends the length of the corridor. Templar kneels, lifting an edge of the rug. Revealing ANTI -THEFT PRESSURE SENSORS. Templar produces a DARTGUN (the size of a flare gun, silenced, with a spool of steel cable attached to the top). He aims down the corridor and fires. A STEEL DART explodes from the barrel, spooling out the cable, and imbeds above the door at corridor's end. Templar yanks the other end of cable from the spool. He looks around for something to secure it. TEMPLAR Sorry about this. He ties the cable around Myaki's bronze neck. He hangs from the cable, testing it. It will hold. He pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips. It's A GLIDER for the cable. He attaches the glider to the cable, grips the handles, and glides the length of the corridor. THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR - OVER THE DOOR Templar bumps up against the door. He pulls his knees up and over the handles of the glider, then flops over backwards, hanging upside down. HIS FACE is now right next to the door handle, over which is an ELECTRONIC LOCK (opened by punching a code). Templar pulls out a BLACK BOX. It's a really small, really powerful computer and its job is to run through every possible number combination in about a minute and a half. Templar wires the computer to the lock with two needlelike ELECTRODE PROBES. He activates the system. The little computer starts running through combinations of numbers. He waits, hanging upside down. Meanwhile-- INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE - ELEVATOR LOBBY The Japanese guards are smoking by the elevator, joking, laughing. One of these guys is a riot... The elevator opens. The CHAMPAGNE SERVER comes out, tray in hand. CHAMPAGNE SERVER Compliments of Mr. Myaki. JAPANESE GUARDS (delighted) Ahh! Beaming, they each take a glass. They clink and drink. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR The computer BEEPS. It's finished. Templar turns the door handle; pushes open the door. He pulls himself up. Hangs from his hands again. He swings his legs back and forth, getting momentum up. He releases from the glider and lunges inside. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES A grand boardroom with Japanese furniture and art. At the end of a fifty-foot mahogany table is a PAINTING OF HIRO MYAKI. Templar walks over to it. TEMPLAR Sorry again. He RIPS the painting off the wall and heaves it aside. And here, where the painting was, is A SAFE. Templar unshoulders his backpack. He pulls out a 40-pound CARLSBAD & RINKER industrial diamond-tipped drill, as big as a jackhammer. No finesse here, people. No, there's no time for high-tech. He's going to drill right through the bitch, right through four inches of tungsten steel. He starts setting up the drill. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE LOBBY Two CHAMPAGNE GLASSES lie shattered on the floor, and next to that mess lie the JAPANESE GUARDS, now unconscious. The champagne server's gone... INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE ...because he's here, moving quickly toward the Myaki Corporation's office, and he's not a champagne server, but a thief and a killer, a blonde Russian named ILYA. Ilya stops just outside the interior corridor. With the GUARD'S KEYRING, he shuts off the anti-theft mats and moves around the corner into the corridor. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR Ilya stops short. His eyes spark. He sees Templar's cable and glider. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES Templar, wearing goggles, leans into the drill as THE BIT CHEWS into the tungsten lock. This is a violent exercise. SINEWS OF METAL spit out like shrapnel. He's through the lock in seconds. Templar heaves the drill aside; it lands with a THUD on the beautiful mahogany table. He opens the safe. INSIDE THE SAFE is one object: A SMALL BOX, the size of a cufflink keeper. Templar grabs it and opens it. INSIDE THE LITTLE BOX is a tiny MICRO-CHIP. Templar closes the box and pockets it. ILYA (v.o.) Don't move. Templar freezes. His eyes twitch. This wasn't in the plan... ILYA (v.o.) Turn around. Slowly. Templar faces Ilya. Ilya has a silenced handgun. ILYA On your knees. (Templar sinks to his knees) Give me the box. Slowly. Templar pulls out the box. Tosses it to Ilya. Ilya raises the handgun at Templar's head. Smiles. Try something: throw an extension cord on the ground. I guarantee it will land coiled in several places. Ilya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drill's extension cord. And this is not lost on Templar. Templar, on his knees, grabs the cord and yanks it; the coil tightens around Ilya's ankles. His legs fly from under him and he goes down, the gun clattering across the floor. Ilya tries to get to his feet. Templar floors him with a right cross. Templar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room. Ilya gains his feet and grabs his gun; sprints after Templar. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE Templar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop it. He jumps, clutching the ceiling girder above. He's going out the way he came in. Suddenly ILYA'S HANDS are around his ankles. Templar falls. He's going 12 stories to his death. No. His fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade. Templar dangles there, looking up at the sadistic face of Ilya. And suddenly below -- INT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM -- A JAPANESE WOMAN, looking up, pointing at the man dangling from the balustrade above, SCREAMS. And now everybody looks up. HIRO MYAKI Sound the alarm! Call the police! INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE Ilya and Templar. Ilya calmly compresses his foot against Templar's left knuckles. ILYA The box please. Templar, grimacing, reaches with his right hand and pulls the box from his pocket. Hands it slowly to Ilya, who reaches over the balustrade for it... TEMPLAR stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs Ilya's hand, jerking him over the balustrade. Ilya falls 12 stories to his death. No he doesn't. He falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade there. Templar clambers up again, atop the balustrade. He jumps to the ceiling girder. Hand over hand, swinging like an acrobat, Templar's across the girder in seconds. He releases from the girder to the window frame. There's one further problem. BULLETS. Ricocheting all around him. Fired by -- ILYA, one floor down. Templar reaches over his shoulder. Pulls a GUN from his backpack. To return fire? No, it's the DART GUN. Templar aims the dart gun out the aperture he cut in the window and fires. EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - 12TH FLOOR A STEEL DART launches from the window, flies fifty yards, and imbeds in the STAIRCASE BULKHEAD OF THE BUILDING ADJACENT TO THE NIKKO. INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE Templar ties the cable to the ceiling girder. He pulls out his black hood and drapes it over the taught cable. He grabs both ends of the hood. And he jumps. EXT. NIKKO HOTEL/ADJACENT BUILDING Templar flies through space, across the cable, the hood acting as a makeshift glider. He lands on the roof of the adjacent building. Templar looks around. SIRENS ARE WAILING. He runs across rooftops, disappearing into the St. Petersburg night. INT . NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM Total chaos. Women screaming, everybody running around. Ilya comes through the panicked crowd. Ten ST. PETERSBURG POLICEMEN enter. ILYA I tried to stop him! He went out the window! Five policemen go for the elevators. Five more exit quickly. Ilya follows. EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - ENTRANCE The befuddled police race off, looking skyward at the top floors of the building. Ilya curses silently. And peels away from the cops and commotion, off into the night. CUT TO: INT. A BRITISH-AIR 747 - MORNING The First Class section. The plane is in flight. A STEWARDESS, young, perky, comes down the aisle pushing a magazine/newspaper cart. STEWARDESS Newspaper sir? SIMON TEMPLAR sits there, dressed as usual without much heed to fashion. Note this, reader: Templar is not a super-spy, super-hero, or super-rake. He is a thief. He's examining several antique Russian BRACELETS and LOCKETS. He looks up at the stewardess. STEWARDESS (Cockney) Wow, are those gorgeous or what... TEMPLAR You have an eye for beauty. Of course - you see it every time you look in the mirror. She blushes, fidgets, as his eyes bore in on her. STEWARDESS Why thank-you, Mr... (reads seat assignment) Templar. She continues down the aisle, smiling to herself. Templar resumes with his lockets. INT. BRITISH AIR 747 - FIVE HOURS LATER The plane has landed. PASSENGERS are filing out past the Stewardess. STEWARDESS Goodbye, goodbye, enjoy your stay in London, etc. Templar moves past the Stewardess, carrying TWO CARRY-ON BAGS. He winks at her. She winks back, and fingers one of the RUSSIAN LOCKETS, now around her neck. STEWARDESS Good-bye, Mr. Templar. As Templar moves off, she smiles to herself and CUT TO: INT. LONDON - HEATHROW AIRPORT Templar walks briskly away from customs. A MAN IN TRENCHCOAT falls in behind Templar. TWO MEN appear in front of Templar, blocking his path; the man behind Templar comes to his side. They are Scotland Yard men BAKER, TEAL, and INSPECTOR MACDUFF. INSPECTOR MACDUFF How's the weather in St. Petersburg? TEMPLAR Cold. INSPECTOR MACDUFF Let's warm things up for you. Baker and Teal gruffly take Templar by the shoulder and walk him forward and CUT TO: INT. HEATHROW CUSTOMS - INTERROGATION ROOM A spartan room, a table and two chairs. MacDuff ransacks TEMPLAR'S BAGS while, across the room -- Templar kisses the wall, hands outstretched, as Baker finishes frisking him. Templar turns. BAKER He's clean. TEMPLAR (to MacDuff) Careful with that. It's delicate equip... MacDuff lifts Templar's 9MM PISTOL from the bag. TEMPLAR . . . ment. MACDUFF Yes. Very. TEMPLAR It's for protection. I deal in antique.... MACDUFF (snaps) I know what you deal in. And these? Your pajamas? He holds up Templar's black bodysuit. TEMPLAR For jogging. My doctor's recommended five miles a... MACDUFF Sit down and shut it. Templar sits down. Baker has Templar's papers. He holds up a certificate. BAKER He's licensed to carry, Inspector. MACDUFF Let's see the passport. (Baker hands MacDuff Templar's passport) What's your nationality this week, Templar? TEMPLAR I forget. MACDUFF (looks at passport) Issued by the Principality of.. . Yemen? You're bloody joking. TEMPLAR (shrugs) Call the embassy MacDuff whips the passport at Templar. Templar calmly moves his head; the passport flies by. Hits the wall. MACDUFF Shut it. MacDuff leans down, coming in close. Templar doesn't blink. His expression never changes. MACDUFF You pass through Russia for a day with that gear and, what a surprise, a prototype computer chip worth quarter of a billion quid is nicked from the Myaki Corporation the night you arrive. We know you didn't fence it in Russia. Where is it? The door opens. Teal enters, tossing several X-RAY PHOTOGRAPHS on the table before MacDuff. Two are of Templar's bags, two are of his body. TEAL (Cockney) All negative. He didn't swallow it. An embarrassing pause. TEMPLAR You've got three options: charge me, or release me. MACDUFF What's the third. TEMPLAR You can kiss my ass. A dreadful pause. MacDuff smiles. He turns away, then turns back and viciously backhands Templar across the face; Templar's head jerks. The blow would knock most men out. Now Templar smiles. Like a serpant. And says calmly: TEMPLAR I'm a busy man. Make up your mind. MacDuff stares at Templar, gritting his teeth. Templar rises. Begins collecting his things. CUT TO: INT. LONDON RESTAURANT - EVENING A quaint place off Piccadilly. The STEWARDESS (from Templar's flight) gulps a martini. She is tipsy. She shows it. STEWARDESS .. . then me mum says, call uncle Charlie, he's in the airline business, there's jobs there, good benefits too, and.. ..where was I? TEMPLAR, enduring this, sits opposite with a scotch. TEMPLAR How you got your job. STEWARDESS Right! (hiccups, giggles) 'Scuze me. Templar motions to a passing WAITRESS. TEMPLAR Another round please. STEWARDESS Ye're tryin' ta get me drunk, aren't you? Are you cute or what? I gotta freshen up. (she rises) Where's the loo in 'ere? TEMPLAR Back there. Leave your locket. I'll polish it for you. She smiles crookedly; hands over the locket. STEWARDESS Are you a dearheart or what... She blows Templar a kiss and lurches off to the bathroom. Templar watches her a moment. When she's gone he puts the locket on the table. He pries open the back of it with a pen-knife. INSERT - THE LOCKET - there is a compartment in which sits THE STOLEN MICRO-CHIP. Templar plucks out the chip and drops it into an envelope. BACK TO SCENE - FOLLOWING THE STEWARDESS as she returns to the table. She sits down. Looks around. Templar's gone. The locket's gone. The waitress appears. STEWARDESS Maam, where's the gent who was sitting 'ere? WAITRESS He left, luv. Said you'd take care of the bill. She hands the Stewardess the bill. She stares at it. STEWARDESS What? She sinks down, confused, blinking, near tears. CUT TO: INT. LONDON - MUSGRAVE HOTEL A small, plush, discrete residential hotel in the heart of Mayfair (Regent Street, Grovesnor Sq. or equivalent). TEMPLAR approaches the front desk with his carry-on bags. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON and the HOTEL MANAGER are behind the desk. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON Mr. Templar! Good to see you sir. Your room key - south penthouse as usual. Your suits are up from storage, pressed of course, and there's a bottle of Oban on the dresser. TEMPLAR Thanks Harry. Oh, and Harry... (pulls out the envelope with the computer chip) .. . ship this by overnight courier to that address. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON Very good sir. JIMMY, a young Bellman, takes Ternplar's bags. Templar doesn't let go. An uncomfortable pause. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON Jimmy, Mr. Templar carries his own bags. Templar steps past Jimmy into the elevator. JIMMY THE BELLMAN What's with the bags, gov'nuh? HOTEL MANAGER They're all he ever brings. The man's bills are paid by a bank in Switzerland and his mailing address is a corporation in Lisbon. Bloody strange... CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON Mr. Templar, strange? No sir, he's just shy. CUT TO: INT . MUSGRAVE HOTEL - SOUTH PENTHOUSE Ternplar sits at a desk with a bottle of Oban scotch and glass, staring at the screen of a modemed MINI-COMPUTER. -- Templar types: LION CONTACTING ZEBRA: IS ZEBRA HOME? -- And this comes back: AFFIRMATIVE, LION. -- Templar types: PIGEON IS FLYING; WILL ARRIVE A.M. -- And this back: EXCELLENT. LION GETS LION'S SHARE. -- Templar types a new command. A new screen appears: ******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* PRIVATE UNMARKED ACCOUNTS PLEASE ENTER SECURITY PASSWORD Templar types in: 77N8LS473Z. This appears: ******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* ACCOUNT OF: TEMPLAR, SIMON BALANCE (AS OF 8/1S/95): U.S. $47,895,12S.12 (Not a typo, reader. It's forty-seven million bucks.) Templar picks up his scotch and drinks, staring at the screen. He's waiting for something... The first digit, "4," vanishes. A "5" appears in it's place. Now fifty-seven million. Templar permits a slight smile, having just made 10 million dollars, and drinks his scotch. The phone RINGS. Templar eyes it skeptically. He picks it up. TEMPLAR Yes. A voice with an Eastern European accent: VOICE Is this Simon Templar? TEMPLAR It depends. VOICE A meeting. Midnight, Blackfriars Bridge. TEMPLAR Involving what? VOICE A lot of money. If you want it. Click. Templar recradles the receiver; He stares at it a moment and CUT TO: INT. MUSGRAVE HOTEL LOBBY - LATER - NIGHT Templar enters the lobby wearing a fresh suit under a black leather trench coat. He goes to the desk, where concierge Harry Winston looks up. TEMPLAR Harry, I'm going for a walk over Blackfriars Bridge. Midnight. Pause. And Harry, just perceptibly, nods. And returns to his obsequious self. HARRY WINSTON Very good, sir. Templar walks off through the lobby. HARRY WINSTON Jimmy (Jimmy walks over) It's about time I taught you how to run the front desk. CUT TO: EXT. LONDON - BLACKFRIAR' S BRIDGE - MIDNIGHT Fog. The bridge lights cast everything in a sickly yellow glow. Below, A TUGBOAT plows the river, horn BELLOWING. The lights of Southwark twinkle beyond. Templar enters from Victoria Embankment. TWO FIGURES emerge from the fog. Templar approaches. One is a huge dim-wit with greasy hair, as tall and wide as a bookcase. His name, aptly, is ZERO. The other is middle-aged and strongly built. A high forehead; clipped, irongrey hair; square jaw and aquiline nose; deep-set, ruthless, unblinking eyes. This is GREGOR TRETIAK. To characterize him as the John Gotti of Russia is to demean him. He is vastly more powerful. TRETIAK Interesting. (sizes up Templar) You are not a big man. But men like you never are. It is my pleasure, Simon Templar. My name is... TEMPLAR I know who you are. Tell me what you want, or I keep walking. TRETIAK Suppose I don't want anything. Suppose I want to kill you. TEMPLAR Suppose there's a high-powered rifle trained at your head. As Tretiak's eyes dart about, Templar raises his hand, waving, signaling to someone below the bridge -- BELOW THE BRIDGE - ON THE VICTORIA EMBANKMENT -- that someone is CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON, in a cloth cap and rain mack now, and yes, he has a 30.6 scoped rifle trained at Tretiak's head. BACK TO THE BRIDGE Tretiak's jaw muscles twitch. He smiles thinly. TRETIAK Rumour has not lied about you, Mr. Templar. Last night something was stolen in St. Petersburg. My city. TEMPLAR You talk about the place as if you own it. TRETIAK (sinisterly) I do, Mr. Templar. May I ask who hired you? TEMPLAR You can ask. I won't answer. TRETIAK What you stole I wanted very badly. (beat) Ilya. Ilya emerges from the shadows. Locks eyes with Templar. The thief from the Nikko! TRETIAK What is the saying - if you can't beat them, why not join them? An American phrase, no? Or are you British? Australian? TEMPLAR I'm nothing. Except bored. Get to the point. TRETIAK (smiles) Of course. An American scientist has worked ten years to develop a certain technology. I am informed that the technology will be made public at the annual nuclear science symposium in Washington D.C. I would like the plans and specifications for this technology. Before the symposium. TEMPLAR What are we talking about? TRETIAK A nuclear fusion generator. We have a man on the inside. TEMPLAR Why can't he steal it? TRETIAK He's tried. The scientist trusts no one and keeps no hard records of the technology in the lab. TEMPLAR Nuclear fusion. They say it's mankind's only hope after all the oil's gone. This guy's actually done it? TRETIAK She. TEMPLAR Come again? TRETIAK She, Mr. Templar. The scientist is a woman. (hands over a dossier) Her dossier. All the information you will need. TEMPLAR My fee is fifteen million U.S. dollars, half up front, half when I deliver. You'll hear from me. Templar turns and walks off. TRETIAK Templar, one question. Templar stops. Turns. TRETIAK I ask you to steal a person's entire life's work. You have no reaction. Are you that cold? Templar stares back, expressionless. He turns and disappears into the fog. TRETIAK No, rumor hasn't lied about you, Templar. CUT TO: EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - ESTABLISHING SHOTS Various establishing shots of this suburban community just north of Manhattan. Pretty, charming, affluent. INT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - SUPERMARKET A large suburban supermarket. The aisles are full of Westchester women: affluent, country clubby, housewifey types. A HAND reaches for a BOTTLE OF LEMONADE (100% Natural) , bringing it down to the eye level of -- JILLIAN ST. THOMAS. She is lean, a swimmer's body perhaps, with terrific acuteness and authority in her thought, speech, and action. Debate this woman? Fine, but you'd better know what the hell you're talking about. Her stare can stop a train. She's casually dressed. Only her JACKET stands out. It's waist-cut, with a colorful diagram of protons and electrons circling a nucleus embroidered on the back. JILLIAN (reads ingredients) Filtered water, high fructose corn syrup. Lemon juice concentrate. Citric acid. Gum acacia...? (grumbles) Totally natural, yeah right. She returns the bottle and turns, coming face-to-face with SIMON TEMPLAR, wearing a moustache and glasses now. He has a bottle of LEMON JUICE in his hand. TEMPLAR Try this. (smiles) Sorry, I overheard. (hands her the bottle) The real thing. No chemicals, no preservatives. She reads the label. Satisfied, she looks at Templar. JILLIAN Thanks. She puts it in her cart and wheels off and CUT TO: INT. SUPERMARKET - PRODUCE SECTION - MINUTES LATER Jillian is examining apples. There is a THUMPING NOISE. It persists. Finally she looks over at -- TEMPLAR. He's standing in front of the watermelons. He's thumping one with his thumb. He notices Jillian. TEMPLAR Hello again. These aren't ripe. How are the apples? JILLIAN Excellent. They're in season. Templar walks over to the apples. Picks one up. Studies it for a moment. TEMPLAR I wonder why He didn't want us to eat these. A pause. She looks at him, puzzled. JILLIAN Who? TEMPLAR God. In the Garden of Eden. JILLIAN Oh right. Sorry, little slow today. Bad headache. (looks at the apple) Uhm, actually, I don't know. TEMPLAR Why wasn't it: "No bananas." Or: "Avoid, at all cost, kumquats." Wonder what God had against apples. She gives him a funny look and turns away. JILLIAN Sorry. Can't help you. TEMPLAR How about William Tell? You really think he shot one of these off his brother's head with an arrow? Jillian turns around again. A pause. JILLIAN Do I know you? TEMPLAR Unlikely. I just moved to New York. She stares at him. This is a very strange man. Intriguing yes, but also possibly a lunatic. She decides to take the dismissive route: JILLIAN Well uhhm, sir, to answer your apple questions, one, I don't know what God's problem was. Two, William Tell, like Paul Bunyon, never existed. And in case you're wondering, Isaac Newton discovered gravity through planetary observation not because one of those fell on his head, and I seriously doubt that eating one a day will keep the doctor away. (beat) Okay? She wheels her cart off. Says over her shoulder: JILLIAN By the way - welcome to the Big Apple. Templar watches her wheel off. His eyes glint. This is going to be interesting... CUT TO: EXT. WESTCHESTER SUPERMARKET - PARKING LOT - DAY Jillian slams down the hatch of her station wagon, now filled with groceries. She gets in. The car pulls out of the parking lot. INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING Jillian, driving, drinking her lemonade, listens to a cassette tape. An authoritative, scholarly, Indian voice: VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) Nuclear fusion occurs when pairs of nuclei meet and their protons and neutrons fuse together into a single nucleus. The fused nuclei move off at high speed, producing energy. Nuclear fusion could provide us with almost unlimited power. JILLIAN No, really? Moron. VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) All you need are two hydrogen gases, deuterium and lithium, and a machine to make them fuse under controlled conditions. JILLIAN C'mon, Dr. Singh. Tell me something I don't know. Jillian sees something through the windshield. She turns down the volume and squints -- JILLIAN'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD A ROLLS ROYCE sits on the road shoulder. As we pass the Rolls, we see SIMON TEMPLAR standing next to it wearing a hopeless expression. BACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN looks at the Rolls in the rear-view mirror. She frowns. JILLIAN Just keep driving. Jillian frowns again. Against her better judgment, she pulls over. Throws it in reverse. EXT. WESTCHESTER - SUBURBAN ROAD SHOULDER - DAY Jillian's station wagon backs up to the Rolls Royce on the road shoulder. Jillian gets out. TEMPLAR Hello! She walks up to him. Together they look down at THE REAR TIRE. It's flat, a pancake. JILLIAN Where's the spare? TEMPLAR I.. .well.. .I'm not really certain. JILLIAN You do know how to change a tire. TEMPLAR Sorry. (beat) I'm not very... mechanical. Jillian rolls her eyes. JILLIAN Give me your keys. Templar hands them over. They walk to the rear. Jillian opens the trunk. They both look down at -- . THE TRUNK'S INTERIOR - THE SPARE TIRE is also flat. TEMPLAR (sheepish) Sorry. Jillian rolls her eyes again. JILLIAN All right, where do you live? TEMPLAR Close. JILLIAN It's your lucky day. (begins to walk off) Come on. Templar watches her walk off. He smiles grimly. CUT TO: INT. JILLIAN'S CAR - DRIVING The car winds through Westchester roads. VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) Research has centered on a machine called a tokamak, developed in Russia, essentially a doughnut shaped tube that contains the gases to be fused. At this, Templar stares at the tape cassette. VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) The tokamak hasn't worked because the two gases must be heated to a temperature of hundreds of millions of degrees, and kept together for several seconds. JILLIAN Try room temperature, idiot. The Tokamak's got it all backwards. TEMPLAR Uhhm. Excuse me. Who is that? JILLIAN Him? A powerful, well-respected man who doesn't know a goddarnn thing what he's talking about. If I got one tenth of his funding... Jillian reaches down and yanks off the cassette player. She looks out the window, grumbling. They drive on. TEMPLAR It's the next left. First driveway on the right. EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - TEMPLAR 'S HOME Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circle of the largest mansion in Westchester County. Just stupendous. INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON Jillian stares, open-mouthed, at the mansion. JILLIAN You live here? (turns to him) Are you for real? He picks up Jillian's lemonade bottle. TEMPLAR Like the label says. No chemicals, no preservatives. JILLIAN (points at the house) You work for this or inherit it? TEMPLAR My father made shoes. I inherited the company. Now I make shoes. JILLIAN (looks at the house) That's a helluva lot of shoes. TEMPLAR Uhm listen, I'm not very good at this and I realize we just met, but I'm even-tempered, politically moderate, belong to no religious cults, have no children I know of, am free of communicable diseases, I happen to find you attractive... JILLIAN Wait a minute, hold on. Are you asking me out on a date? TEMPLAR Yes. JILLIAN How do you know I'm not married? TEMPLAR I believe the fourth finger on your left hand is... JILLIAN (quickly) Okay so I'm not married. I could have a boyfriend. TEMPLAR I'd be surprised if you didn't have several. JILLIAN Be surprised. Lemme give you a hand. Jillian pops the wagon's back hatch and gets out. Templar follows. They walk to the wagon's rear. JILLIAN What about you? There's no wife stashed on some island someplace? TEMPLAR No wife stashed on some island. They pick up Templar's groceries; each takes two bags. JILLIAN No mistress? C'mon. No bimbo on the side? TEMPLAR Not a one. They walk toward the mansion. JILLIAN Well, that's a start. Here's the deal with me: I am not particularly even-tempered, I'm staunchly liberal, belong to no religious cults but I do believe in God as a basic force of good, have no children because one has to have sex to do that and, well, let's not pursue that, am free of communicable diseases, see above, and you're an attractive man, if a little weird, and well.. .hell, why not. (smiles) You've got a date, shoemaker. What's your name? TEMPLAR Michael. Michael Quinn. They reach the mansion's front veranda. They set the groceries on a wicker couch. JILLIAN I'm Jillian St. Thomas. They shake hands. Jillian fishes for a pen. JILLIAN I'll give you my number. TEMPLAR Just say it. I have a good memory. JILLIAN (looks at him) Eight seven seven, five two nine eight. TEMPLAR Good. Great. I'll call you. JILLIAN I've heard that before. TEMPLAR I will call you. You saved me today. Thanks again. She walks off to her car. Templar turns toward the front door. Jillian suddenly stops. Turns. JILLIAN Hey. (Templar turns) What's my number? TEMPLAR (without hesitation) Eight seven seven, five two nine eight. JILLIAN smiles and continues toward the car, mumbling: JILLIAN And he has a brain. What do you know. AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR - TEMPLAR watches Jillian get in her wagon and drive off. Then Templar keys open the door and enters. INT. WESTCHESTER MANSION - DAY The place is empty. Totally. No furniture. Nothing. Just Templar's two CARRY-ON BAGS on the floor in front of Templar. DISSOLVE TO: INT. WESTCHESTER MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT It's late now. About 10 p.m. Templar sits on a packing crate in the vacant living room with a glass of scotch, studying Jillian's life. There are pages of personal data and many photographs: Jillian in cap and gown; Jillian in a lab coat; Jillian at the beach, etc. DISSOLVE TIME CUT TO: A LEGAL PAD, with Templar's handwritten note: NO HARD COPIES - COMPUTER SOFTWEAR TEMPLAR stares into the screen of his mini-computer. It is two hours later. INSERT - THE MINI-COMPUTER SCREEN - Templar has entered every detail of Jillian's life. Looks like this: Home state: Massachusetts Hometown: Milton Highschool: Milton Academy Highschool mascot: Bulldogs University: Harvard University mascot: Crimson It just goes on and on: names of parents, family members, teachers, pets, boyfriends; favorite movies, colors, sports teams, hobbies, etc. DISSOLVE TIME CUT TO: TEMPLAR finishes entering the details of Jillian's life. He copies it onto a 3 1/4 disk, pulls out the disk and shuts off the minicomputer. He leans down and picks up a SHOE BOX. Opens it. He lifts out a WOMAN'S SHOE and jerks the heel, which lifts away from the sole on hinges. revealing a hidden compartment, in which Templar places a small transistor. He clicks the heel shut. THE SHOE -- MATCH DISSOLVES TO: THE SAME SHOE, now on Jillian's foot and WIDEN TO -- INT. MANHATTAN - LE CIRQUE -- Jillian and Templar at a corner table in Le Cirque. The meal is over. They're drinking coffee, laughing, at ease. The "date" is going well. TEMPLAR I am not eccentric. JILLIAN No? You live in the biggest house in America but do your own shopping, you talk to strange women about the history of apples, and you give a first-time date.. . shoes? Isn't the tradition flowers? TEMPLAR You said you liked them. JILLIAN I do. I'm joking. They're beautiful. Thank-you. They smile at each other. A WAITER brings more coffee. There's a sudden commotion. Jillian and Templar look -- ACROSS THE ROOM - a group of WAITERS are clapping their hands for a YOUNG COUPLE seated at a table. JILLIAN (to the waiter) What happened? WAITER (smiles) He just asked her to marry him. Anything else? JILLIAN looks at the radiant young couple. Smiles. TEMPLAR Just the check please. (the waiter exits; Jillian looks at him) You didn't answer my question. Maybe it made you uncomfortable. Maybe I should just shut up... JILLIAN No, it's all right. Okay: "Why Jillian never got married, chapter One:" I don't know where you're from. . . TEMPLAR Canada. JILLIAN I don't know what it's like there, but here, if a teenage girl doesn't want to be a cheerleader, or drink 'till she pukes every weekend, or talk endlessly on the phone every night about absolutely nothing, then she doesn't win many popularity contests, know what I mean? That pretty much took care of highschool. TEMPLAR College? JILLIAN Try earning double p.h.d.'s from Harvard before you turn twenty-three and having a social life. TEMPLAR Can I ask a personal question? (she nods) What's your I.Q.? JILLIAN (laughs) That's personal? My I.Q.? Let's just say it's high. TEMPLAR Very high. JILLIAN Yes, very high. As high as yours. TEMPLAR You don't honestly mean that. JILLIAN Oh, you're a smart one, shoemaker. It's in the eyes. I can always tell. They stare at each other. Neither averts eyes. JILLIAN I just don't often get the opportunity. It feels nice. TEMPLAR For me, too. (and he means this:) You're very pretty. JILLIAN Stop it. Flattery will get you... someplace. I don't know where yet. She smiles. The waiter arrives with the check; gives it to Templar. Jillian picks up her purse and takes her wallet out. Templar sees her doing this... TEMPLAR No no no, absolutely not. Put that away. JILLIAN It's not for us. It's for the couple over there. (points at the couple across the room) Waiter, put their bill on my card please. WAITER Maam? Are you sure? Jillian nods. The waiter takes Jillian's card, exits. Jillian smiles at Templar. [Due to his mean origins and evolution, Templar has witnessed approximately three charitable acts in his whole life, and this was the third.] Thus does Simon Templar smile uneasily back. CUT TO: INT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT Neat, modest, non-descript. Jillian and Templar enter. Jillian walks across the living room into a bar alcove off the living room. JILLIAN I'll make the booze. Turn on the news. I want to catch up on that Russia thing. Templar turns on the T.V. His eyes rove around, casing the place. JILLIAN (o.s.) What do you want, Michael? I've got everything. TEMPLAR Scotch please. No ice. CNN EVENING NEWS with anchor BERNARD SHAW comes on. BERNARD SHAW (on T.V.) .. ..of the steadily growing NeoCzarist Party, leveled more allegations against President Victor Karpov. According to Romanov, two men, Gregor Tretiak... Templar looks at the T.V. and double takes. A PHOTO OF GREGOR TRETIAK has appeared on the screen. BERNARD SHAW (o.s.) .. . and Ivan Gracha... A PHOTO OF IVAN GRACHA, 50's, short, beady-eyed, sinister, appears on the screen. JILLIAN pokes her head out of the bar. JILLIAN What brand? BERNARD SHAW (o.s.) ...allegedly the most powerful of Russia's underworld bosses, are linked to President Karpov in illegal enterprises... JILLIAN walks over to Templar. They watch together. JILLIAN That country's going to explode. TEMPLAR It very well might. Oban. JILLIAN What? . TEMPLAR My brand of scotch. Oban. Have any? JILLIAN No, but there's a liquor store five minutes away. She grabs her coat, heads for the door. TEMPLAR Wait. Don't be ridiculous. She stops. Looks at him. JILLIAN I want to be ridiculous. (pause) Michael, I haven't had anybody over in...a long time. And I happen to like you. I want to do this right. Okay? (he smiles; nods) I'll be back in ten minutes. (points at fireplace) Build a fire. She winks at him and exits. Templar walks to the window and stands there, waiting. We hear Jillian's car start, see the headlights. TEMPLAR You're making this too easy, dear. He pulls from his pocket a BLACK CASE, flips it open, turns it on. On a miniature computer screen is a detailed map of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. Two locations are pulsing: 1) Jillian's house and 2) a moving object, transmitted from a homing device, which we now see  INT. JILLIAN' S CAR - DRIVING -- it's in JILLIAN'S SHOE as she stamps on the brake at a stoplight and waits and we CUT BACK to the house... INT. JILLIAN' SHOUSE - BACK HALLWAY TEMPLAR moves down the hall opening doors, looking for Jillian's lab. He moves quickly, ruthlessly. He comes to a heavily locked FIRE DOOR. He unpockets a set of burglar's tools. For Templar, these locks are a joke. He opens them with alarming speed. He pushes open the door, revealing a DESCENDING STAIRCASE. He descends. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BASMENT Templar finds a lightswitch and flips it on. His eyes widen. Here we find -- JILLIAN'S LABORATORY. A POOL OF WATER (the size of a small swimming pool) is surrounded by HUNDREDS OF TEST TUBES of various shapes and sizes containing chemicals. Templar moves through, eyes scanning everything. He sees JILLIAN'S COMPUTER. Walks over to it. He unpockets the HOMING SYSTEM and sets it on the desk. The PULSING LIGHT is still moving; Jillian hasn't yet reached the liquor store. He turns on Jillian's monitor and hard drive. The COMPUTER SCREEN blinks on. We see a MENU: A.) Personal finances B.) Income tax C.) Things to do D.) Addresses E.) Research Templar positions the cursor on "E.) Research" and hits "enter." The modem engages; this appears: ******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ******* PLEASE WAIT Then this appears: RETRIEVAL CODE: _____________________ TEMPLAR Smart girl. Send your data into cyberspace and only you can retrieve it. Because only you have the code. He unpockets the 3 1/4 disk containing the data from Jillian's life and pushes it into the disk drive. He types a command; a new screen appears: DATA ENTRY SYSTEM Press any key to begin Templar hits a key and the old screen reappears: ******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ******* PLEASE WAIT RETRIEVAL CODE: ______________________ But now, in the space next to "Retrieval Code," Templar's data appears. word after word, like this: -- "Massachusetts" -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED -- "Boston" -- -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED. -- "Milton" -- -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED -- "Milton Academy" -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED -- "Bulldogs" -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED It's incredibly fast, a new word appearing every second, as the system tries to crack Jillian's code. But the computer denies access to each word. The HOMING DEVICE suddenly BEEPS. The pulsing light has stopped, indicating Jillian is at the liquor store. Templar grimly turns back to the computer. CUT TO: INT. WESTCHESTER LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT The clerk, WALTER, hands Jillian her change. She exits with a SCOTCH BOTTLE in a brown wrapper. CLERK Goodnight Jillian. JILLIAN Night, Walter. INT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY - NIGHT Templar paces; he looks at the homing device. The PULSING LIGHT is moving back toward Jillian's house. Templar looks at the computer; his system continues entering words: "Hendrix." ACCESS DENIED. "Purple Haze." ACCESS DENIED. "Red Sox." ACCESS DENIED. "Celtics." ACCESS DENIED. On and on...each is met with ACCESS DENIED. INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING - NIGHT Jillian, driving, turns on the radio. She hums along. INT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY Templar stares at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulse is getting closer; it's do or die now... Templar's system suddenly stops. It has run through every word. Each has met with failure. TEMPLAR frowns. He yanks the system disk from the disk drive. He begins pacing... TEMPLAR Okay, think. Think. Templar suddenly gets an idea. He sits and types: "Tokamak." ACCESS DENIED Templar stares at the screen in frustration. He looks at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulsing light is getting really close. Templar concentrates with every brain cell. We can feel him think. He's remembering something. MEMORY FLASHBACK We're in Jillian's car again, when they first met. JILLIAN Try room temperature, idiot. The Tokamak's got it all backwards. BACK TO THE LABORATORY Templar grabs a pencil and notepad and spells out: TOKAMAK. Under this he spells it backwards: KAMAKOT. He turns to the computer and types: "KAMAKOT" And instantly this flashes: ACCESS GRANTED. TEMPLAR Open sesame. The retrieval begins: A DOCUMENT appears on the screen: THE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION Submitted by: DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS Templar scrolls through the document; we see a dizzying display of graphs, tables, plans, specifications, etc. Templar pulls out the disk containing Jillian's data and shoves a fresh disk into the disk drive. He begins copying Jillian's research from harddrive to disk. He looks at the HOMING DEVICE. Christ, she's almost back.. .and indeed -- EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE -- Jillian's car comes wheeling into the driveway. INT. JILLIAN' S LABORATORY - NIGHT The document is copied. Templar grabs the copied disk from the disk drive and rips the slip of paper from the notepad. He flicks off the computer and sprints across the lab, then up the stairs. EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE Jillian reaches for the doorknob and enters -- INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE She comes in. TEMPLAR, relaxed, lounges on the couch, flipping through some magazines. He smiles: TEMPLAR That was quick. She walks past him to the bar alcove. JILLIAN Now Mr. Michael Quinn, let's have that scotch. Hey, what happened to the fire? TEMPLAR I thought we'd create our own. JILLIAN (smiles) Down boy. He gets up; goes to the fireplace; grabs some logs and lays them across the andirons and we -- DISSOLVE TO: THE LOGS, now gently burning. Cole Porter is playing. CAMERA PANS past Jillian's shoes on the carpet, past the Oban Scotch on the coffee table, now half empty, to -- -- the couch, where Jillian and Templar are locked in a heavy kiss. Jillian stops. JILLIAN Whoah whoah whoah, time to put on the brakes. Those lips oughtta be licensed buddy... TEMPLAR Sorry. I wasn't trying to... JILLIAN I know you weren't but if we keep going I'm gonna be the one who gets us both in trouble. Whew! (fans herself) Haven't felt like that for awhile. (she brushes a lock of hair from his eyes) Am I going to see you again? A pause. Perhaps, just perhaps, for the first time in his black life Templar's having a hard time lying... JILLIAN Michael? TEMPLAR (smiles at her) How about breakfast? JILLIAN It's a date. I'll walk you out, shoemaker. EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT In the threshold they kiss again. TEMPLAR Good-night. JILLIAN 'Bye. Drive safe. Templar walks off to his Rolls Royce parked in the driveway. He smiles at her and waves. He turns toward his car; his face goes hard and cold. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NEVSKY PROSPECT - CONTINUOUS LATE AFTERNOON On the Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's equivalent of the Champs-Elysees  MICHAEL ROMANOV stands on a raised platform outside the gates of a PALATIAL MANSION taking up a whole city block. TEN THOUSAND SUPPORTERS surround him. Many carry large, slogan-filled banners. Four THUGGISH-LOOKING MEN stand guard inside the mansion's compound, giving Romanov the eye. One is ZERO (Tretiak's bodyguard on Blackfriars Bridge). MICHAEL ROMANOV Where is Russia's capital? Moscow? The Kremlin? No, Russia's capital is... (points at mansion) THROUGH THOSE GATES! (crowd CHEERS) A den of thieves! A LIMOUSINE pulls through the crowd, which reluctantly parts. The guards within the compound open the gates. MICHAEL ROMANOV And here - the Prince of Thieves! GREGOR TRETIAK sits in the back of the limousine, silently glaring at Romanov. The limousine rolls inside the compound, the gates CLANGING shut. MICHAEL ROMANOV Every citizen in St. Petersburg knows what that man does, yet the police don't arrest him. They protect him! How can this be? Maybe we should ask our elected whores in Moscow! The CROWD CHEERS WILDLY and starts hurling rocks, bottles, etc, through the gate at -- -- TRETIAK, emerging from the limousine. Tretiak's guards surround him; they move quickly up the mansion's marble steps, dodging the thrown debris. SIRENS WAIL. Four large police vans roar up, the back doors flinging open. ST. PETERSBURG POLICE, in riot gear, deploy from the vans. The police push into the crowd, wielding riot shields and batons. A melee breaks out, Romanov supporters versus the police. INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - EVENING Tretiak and his men move past A GUARD STATION manned by TWO GUARDS watching six SURVEILLANCE MONITORS (showing, at all times, certain areas of. the compound). This is a former nobleman's residence; a 20 foot diameter CRYSTAL CHANDELIER hangs from the domed roof fifty feet above. A spectacular staircase ascends to a mezzanine, with offices (formerly bed chambers) off it. Tretiak approaches a man in a lab coat, ZUBOV, wearing a grim, anxious expression. Zubov chainsmokes constantly. ZUBOV There's a problem. Tretiak follows Zubov down stairs into -- INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - BASEMENT LABORATORY -- a large room with TECHNICIANS hunched over computers. Tretiak follows Zubov to a large bank of computers. ZUBOV (indicates computer) This is the data your thief sent us. Tretiak looks at Zubov's COMPUTER SCREEN. INSERT - THE COMPUTER SCREEN. Again we see: THE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION Submitted by: DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS BACK TO SCENE TRETIAK (confused) Cold fusion? ZUBOV Yes. Fusion at room temperature. Regarded as an impossibility by the scientific community. A myth. (smiles) Then I read this. Zubov begins scrolling through the document; again we see the displav of graphs. tables. plans. Specs.. etc. ZUBOV She first proves why hot fusion - the tokamak - is impractical. You must heat the hydrogen gases so high, more energy is wasted than created. Here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion. (scrolls more pages) The hydrogen isotopes needed. (scrolls more pages) The physical plant. She even estimates its cost. Extraordinary. (scrolls more pages) The next pages are the critical part, what no one in fifty years has discovered. (looks up at Tretiak) The combination of chemicals in which atoms will fuse at room temperature. Tretiak leans toward the screen, waiting. TRETIAK Well? Let's see. ZUBOV Tretiak - I think from reading this that the woman's done it. She may have found a source of unlimited energy. TRETIAK What do you mean may have. Show me. ZUBOV I said there was a problem. Zubov hits the "scroll" key. The next page appears; we see the heading at the top of the page: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION But there's something wrong with the rest of the page. Terribly wrong. We know this because of  TRETIAK'S EXPRESSION, and it's not too happy. TRETIAK Where's the rest of it? ZUBOV It's in her head. and CUT TO: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING JILLIAN, humming the Cole Porter song from the previous evening, fills a basket with breakfast for two: eggs, bagels, etc. Sunlight streams in. Birds chirping. She wears jeans and her jacket with the atomic diagram embroidered on the back. She grabs flowers from a vase; tosses them in the basket. Smiles. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM She enters with the basket. Looks at the disheveled couch and the bottle of Oban. She hums the Cole Porter song, stabs her feet in THE SHOES TEMPLAR GAVE HER and goes to the front door. EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT Jillian comes out, running into -- YURI, her lab assistant, who comes up the front stoop. Mid-20's, heavy Russian accent, white lab coat. YURI Good morning, boss. Where are you going? JILLIAN To see a friend. Be back in a couple hours. She gets in her car. Yuri gives her a look, goes inside. INT. JILL IAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM Yuri enters. The foyer phone RINGS. Yuri answers. YURI Doctor St. Thomas' residence. ILYA (o.s., in Russian) There's been a change of plans. Yuri stares at the phone and -- CUT TO: EXT. WESTCHESTER - TEMPLAR' S MANSION - MORNING The huge estate, as before. Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circular driveway. Jillian gets out with the breakfast basket. Moves up the flagstoned walk. Suddenly the front door opens. A WOMAN, mid-30's, pretty and well-dressed, comes out and locks the door. JILLIAN watches her. The woman comes down the walk. WOMAN May I help you? (beat) Do you have an appointment? JILLIAN A what? WOMAN To see the house. JILLIAN The man who lives here... who owns the house... WOMAN What man. The estate is rented for weddings and corporate events. Are you. ..interested...? JILLIAN No. No. The rental agent gives Jillian a funny look and gets in her car. Drives off. Jillian stares at the house, thunderstruck. Then she sharply inhales: JILLIAN Oh my god. ... Jillian gets in her car. CUT TO: TEMPLAR'S COMPUTER screen, which reads: ******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* PRIVATE UNMARKED ACCOUNTS PLEASE ENTER SECURITY PASSWORD INT. J.F.K. INT. - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS TEMPLAR sits in the British Air lounge. He has shaved and his eyeglasses are gone; he looks like himself again. In the b.g., businessmen are relaxing, reading newspapers, drinking coffee. Over the intercom: INTERCOM VOICE Varig Air flight 157 to Rio de Janeiro, departing at 8 a.m, boarding now from gate seventeen. Templar checks his wristwatch: It's 7:40 a.m. Templar types in his password and waits. On the screen, this: ******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* ACCOUNT OF: TEMPLAR, SIMON BALANCE (AS OF 8/15/95): U.S. $57,895,125.12 (the same balance since London). Templar frowns. Something's not right. He hasn't been paid. CUT TO: INT. JILLIAN' SHOUSE - BACK HALLWAY - MORNING Jillian runs down the hall, breath escaping her lungs. JILLIAN The supermarket, the flat tire, all a set-up. You fool. You fool. (calls down the hall) Yuri! She unpockets her keyring, her hands trembling uncontrollably. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - MORNING Jillian races down the stairs and across the lab to her computer. She moves in a panic, as if in a living nightmare. She turns the computer on. She types in the code word, "kamakot," and her research paper appears on the screen. In the lower right corner it reads: LAST ENTERED: 10:23 p.m. JILLIAN No.. . .. She sees something on the desk. The NOTEPAD on which Templar wrote his notes. The page is indented with Templar's pen marks; the words "tokamak" and "kamakot" are clearly visible. JILLIAN No, this can't be happening. Yuri! (turns, calling) YURI! She jumps, startled, because YURI is right behind her. He moves toward her and -- CUT TO: INT. J.F.K. INT. - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS WOMAN (o.s.) Is that a good system? A WOMAN, 40's, dowdy and serious in an accountant-like way, has sat down across from Templar. Points at Templar's computer. TEMPLAR Yes. WOMAN ACCOUNTANT (o.s.) Going to Europe? (Templar ignores her) Uhmm, I'm going for coffee. Like some? It's really no trouble. ... Okay lady, anything to get rid of you: TEMPLAR Sure. Black please. She smiles and walks off to the coffee counter, passing A BUSINESSMAN, who sits down with a steaming cup of coffee and starts reading the WALL STREET JOURNAL. Templar eyes the man, then looks back at his computer. He begins typing. The phone modem engages.  Templar types: LION CONTACTING BEAR. IS BEAR HOME? -- This comes back: AFFIRMATIVE. -- Templar types: LION HAS NOT BEEN PAID. EXPLAIN. -- This comes back: LION'S DATA IS DEFECTIVE. -- Templar types: DEFINE "DEFECTIVE." -- This comes back: LIONS EMPLOYMENT TERMINATED. Templar stares at the screen, his mind racing... THE ACCOUNTANT WOMAN comes back to the table with Templar's coffee. Sets it before him. Smiles. TEMPLAR Thanks. INTERCOM (v.o.) British Air flight 74 to London now boarding from gate fifteen. I repeat, British Air Flight 74... The Woman Accountant rises, picks up her bag. WOMAN ACCOUNTANT Well, that's me. So long. She smiles. Templar sort of smiles back. She walks off to catch her flight. THE BUSINESSMAN next to Templar, hidden behind his newspaper, sets his coffee cup down next to Templar's. The Businessman flips a page, engrossed in an article. He reaches back for his coffee, but takes Templar's cup. He drinks from the cup. TEMPLAR Excuse me, that's my. . . . The Businessman's newspaper is shaking. Violently. It falls to the table. The Businessman's face is flushed. He twitches. He pitches over. His head THUDS on the table. Templar feels the Businessman's carotid artery. He's dead. Templar picks up his coffee and smells it. Templar's eyes dart to the lounge. The Lady Accountant is gone. Nobody in the lounge has noticed what's happened. Templar hurriedly collects his things. CUT TO: EXT. WESTCHESTER - JILLIAN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY AN AIRPORT TAXI stops at the curb. Templar gets out, paying the cabbie. The taxi pulls away. Templar approaches the house, eyes darting. He moves toward the door, unpocketing his 9mm pistol. He checks the doorknob, turning it. It's open. ... INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - DAY Templar enters. No one is here. He moves through the living room into the back corridor, glancing into the kitchen, where we see that -- INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY -- SOMEONE is behind the refrigerator, holding a SILENCED GUN in a blackgloved hand. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY Templar moves through the hall, looking in each door. He comes to the lab staircase. The door is open. Templar heads down the stairs. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - DAY Templar comes down; he walks to the computer. He looks at the document on the screen. He begins scrolling, going to the end this time. We see the graphs, tables, plans, specs., etc. Then the critical page appears: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION And under that. . . .. A NINTENDO GAME. Little spaceships are flying around chasing other little spaceships! TEMPLAR stares at it, stunned: what he sent the Russians is essentially worthless. Templar shuts off the monitor. The screen blackens. The black screen reflects light. It reflects A PERSON coming down the stairs. A person with a gun... Templar dives away as THREE BULLETS blow the computer monitor to shards. THE WOMAN FROM THE J.F.K. LOUNGE, not an accountant but an assassin, draws a bead on -- TEMPLAR, who scrambles across the room ducking under lab tables as BULLETS shatter bottles, beakers, test tubes; glass fills the air. TEMPLAR stands up, his 9mm leveled at the woman. The woman's gun is leveled at Templar. - TEMPLAR That's a Reuger nine shot. I counted nine. FEMALE ASSASSIN What if you're wrong. The tension boils. Templar was right: her hand flashes to the gun, ejecting the spent clip. She tries to ram in a fresh clip but she's not fast enough... TEMPLAR'S across the room in half a second. He presses his gun to her forehead. TEMPLAR When were you hired and for what? I'm not in a very good mood... Templar cocks the hammer. This gets her attention. FEMALE ASSASSIN Okay. Take it easy. I was hired a week ago to take you and the woman out, and detonate the house. It was empty when I got here. TEMPLAR Who's your employer? FEMALE ASSASSIN I don't ask names. TEMPLAR Did they have accents? Russian? (she nods; he lowers his gun) I'm paying you out of your contract. Don't ask questions. What's your price? FEMALE ASSASSIN Fifty thousand for you, fifty for her, fifty for the house. Templar pulls out his wallet, from which he unfolds three pieces of negotiable paper. Hands them to her. She examines them. TEMPLAR U.S. bearer bonds. Good as cash. FEMALE ASSASSIN About the airport - no offense you understand. TEMPLAR None taken. Go and don't come back. And she turns and walks off. INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM Templar enters, looking around, thinking. He looks in the bathroom. He looks in the closet. On the floor are Jillian's footwear: sneakers, pumps, cowboy boots, etc. Right, Templar, the shoes... TEMPLAR pulls out his HOMING DEVICE and clicks it on. INSERT - HOMING DEVICE SCREEN Like before, an electronic rendering of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. But no pulsing light. Templar enters commands, adjusting the screen, widening it to GREATER NEW YORK. Somewhere in Queens, fairly close to the Atlantic Ocean, we see a PULSING LIGHT. But it's fixed, inert. The pulsing light begins to move east, quickly. Templar watches it. The pulse is moving too quickly for an automobile. And it's heading for the ocean. And it goes in the ocean! TEMPLAR (dawning on him) A. . . .plane. Indeed, Simon Templar, a plane. CUT TO: INT. PRIVATE JET - IN FLIGHT OVER ATLANTIC A mid-sized gulfstream. JILLIAN sits in a wheelchair, covered with a blanket. She stirs. Mumbles something. Slowly opens her eyes. Yuri approaches. Yuri lifts away the blanket. Jillian's wrists are tied to the wheelchair armrests, her ankles to the footrests. Yuri produces a SYRINGE. He grabs Jillian's forearm and pushes in the needle. Jillian's head bobs forward. CUT TO: INT. J. F. K.

J.F.K. - "AIR FRANCE" - CONCORDE TERMINAL The passengers are in a line, going through security. Templar walks up next to A GUY IN A BROOKS BROTHERS SUIT. Stares at him. After a few seconds of this... BROOKS BROTHERS MAN Can I help you with something? TEMPLAR Your ticket. What'd you pay for it? BROOKS BROTHERS MAN What? TEMPLAR I'll give you twenty grand for it. Cash. Right now. (they stop) I need to get on that plane. BROOKS BROTHERS MAN Very badly obviously. (studies Templar) Fifty thousand and it's yours. Templar rolls his eyes but the guy is unmoved. Templar scowls and pulls out his bearer bonds... CUT TO: INT. MARSEILLES - AIRPLANE HANGAR - CONTINUOUS A hangar at Marseilles' Marignane Airport. A MAN is sprawled inside the engine cowling of a WWI classic BIWING FIGHTER. We only see his legs. VOICE Remy! Telephone. REMY (IN ENGINE COWLING) Oui. Un moment. REMY SAMARKAND, 40's, Algerian, pulls himself up and sits on the engine cowling. Bandanna around neck. Cigar. A tattoo here, a scar there... COCO, a young mechanic, hands Remy a CELLULAR PHONE. REMY SAMARKAND Merci, Coco. (Coco walks off) Remy Samarkand Aeronautique, Remy Samarkand. TEMPLAR (v.o.) I need a favour, Remy. REMY SAMARKAND (smiles) Anything for Simon Templar... CUT TO: EXT.

DE GAULLE AIRPORT - TARMAC Templar, with his carry-on bags, and Remy Samarkand run across the tarmac toward a LEAR JET being fueled. In the b.g. sits the huge Concorde jet. They yell over the howling jet engines. TEMPLAR IT'S A LITTLE JET, MAYBE A TURBO PROP. ENTERED SCOTLAND FIVE MINUTES AGO, GO ING TO ST. PETERSBURG. CAN WE GET TO IT BEFORE THEN? REMY SAMARKAND OUI . OVER FINLAND. INT. REMY' S LEAR JET - MINUTES LATER THE HOMING DEVICE - The screen shows a MAP OF EUROPE. Two locations are pulsing: 1) Remy's jet, moving north from Paris; and 2) The jet carrying Jillian, moving across Scotland heading due east. The plane is in flight. Templar's homing device and mini-computer sit on the cockpit console. TEMPLAR What are you smuggling these days? REMY SAMARKAND Oh, things. How long has it been  two year? Three? Now tell me: what's so important about this plane? TEMPLAR Fifteen million dollars of my money. (picks up cellular phone) And a score to settle. Templar punches numbers and CUT TO: EXT. EAST BERLIN - DAY The city's decrepid industrial section. PANNING PAST buildings we come to the facade of "APEX ELECTRONICS," the only well-maintained building on the block. A throbbing drum-beat is heard within... INT. EAST BERLIN - APEX ELECTRONI CS - DAY Organized. Spotless. You could eat off the floor. A STEREO plays GERMAN TECHNO-ROCK at a zillion decibals. A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE hangs from a hoist. BERTA FRANK (hereafter "FRANKIE), late 20's, blonde spiky hair, pretty in a sort of dangerous way, is soldering a panel of transistors to the satellite. A wall-mounted T.V. plays a news program. GERMAN NEWS ANCHOR (German) In Russia, Michael Romanov has been accused of inciting riots and violence in St. Petersburg... The phone RINGS. Frankie grabs it. FRANKIE Ja. TEMPLAR (v.o.) How's the weather in Berlin, Frankie? FRANKIE Simon? Where are you? INTERCUT - SIMON IN REMY' S PLANE / FRANKIE IN BERLIN TEMPLAR Unimportant. How soon can you be in St. Petersburg? Frankie looks at her wristwatch. FRANKIE Five hours. What type of job? TEMPLAR Eyes and ears. Two hundred thousand cash for two days work. FRANKIE Who's the mark? TEMPLAR Gregor Tretiak. His headquarters. His office in particular. Frankie lights a cigarette. Thinks. FRANKIE Gregor Tretiak is not a very nice man, Simon. Four hundred thousand. TEMPLAR Deal. Now listen, Frankie... DISSOLVE TO: INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY Four hours later. Jillian sits, head bowed, unconscious. Yuri sits opposite. He is nodding off. If only Jillian could wake up... The PILOT shouts back. PILOT We're over Helsinki. Yuri wakes, sits upright. Yawns. INT. REMY'S LEAR JET - DAY Remy's peering out the window. Sees something. REMY SAMARKAND Simon, there! Two miles ahead, THE RUSSIAN JET roars past, heading east toward St. Petersburg. Remy jerks the stick, banking into a right turn behind the Russian jet. Remy looks at his ALTITUDE GAUGE. REMY SAMARKAND They're descending. Remy looks at Templar; Templar nods back. Remy pushes the stick; the Lear jet begins descending. INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY Jillian sits, still unconscious. Or is she? JILLIAN' S POV - THROUGH SLITTED EYES Through the tiniest slit of eye, so as not to appear conscious, Jillian looks at Yuri, then at TWO PARACHUTES shelved above the emergency exit. BACK TO SCENE - YURI stands up and stretches. He goes to the window and looks out. [Wheelchair trivia: wheelchair armrests are removable, enabling a patient to transfer himself from the chair to a regular chair, or car seat, etc...] JILLIAN'S RIGHT HAND (photographed in extreme close-up under the blanket) pulls out the PIN securing the armrest to the wheelchair. She lifts the armrest, separating the aluminum tubing, freeing her right wrist. INT. REMY'S LEAR JET - DAY Through the windshield is the RUSSIAN GULF STREAM. Remy, his headset on, turns to Templar. REMY The St. Petersburg tower wants us to circle. TEMPLAR No. Follow them down. REMY What do we do when we land? TEMPLAR Haven't figured that out yet. INT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY The aircraft is tilted forward in descent. The PILOT shouts back to Yuri: PILOT (Russian, subtitled) Prepare for landing. The Pilot shuts the cockpit door. Suddenly JILLIAN'S EYES are open; her hands are free and she's throwing off the blanket and gripping the wheels. She pushes; the wheelchair bursts forward. YURI gets to his feet; the wheelchair slams against his shins. Jillian WHIPS the detached armrest across Yuri's head. Yuri falls backward, dazed. Jillian rolls to the emergency door, one hand yanking open the door, the other grabbing a PARACHUTE from the shelf. Wind howls through the cabin. Jillian gets the parachute on. Her ankles are still bound to the footrests. To hell with it, she'll lose the wheelchair in mid-air. She pushes forward as -- -- YURI lunges across the floor, grabbing the wheels. JILLIAN AND THE CHAIR teeter on the edge of emergency door exit, half in, half out. Yuri clings to the chair wheels. His body jerks forward. He's sliding on his stomach. Jillian and the chair are pulling him out. Terror in Yuri's eyes. He grabs for the door frame. His fingers slip. Jillian, the wheelchair, and Yuri hanging from the wheelchair, plunge from the aircraft. INT. REMY' S LEAR JET - DAY Templar's bagging his computer and homing device. REMY suddenly clutches his arm. REMY Simon. Templar looks up. TEMPLAR' S /REMY' S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD JILLIAN AND YURI fall from the aircraft. INT . THE RUSS IAN GULFSTREAM The pilot, looking down at Jillian and Yuri, clicks on his short-wave radio: PILOT We have a problem. EXT. SKIES OVER ST. PETERSBURG - DAY JILLIAN freefalls in the wheelchair, her ankles still bound to the chair's footrests. YURI is beneath her, clutching the wheels. He tries to pull himself up. JILLIAN yanks the rip-cord; a plume of silk spills out and Jillian and the chair SLINGSHOT UP, decelerating from 120 m.p.h. to 20 m.p.h. in two seconds. Yuri can't take the "G" force; his hands rip away from the chair. He plummets, SCREAMING, and 3000 feet later he will hit concrete in St. Petersburg. Jillian pulls out the footrest pins (the footrests separate from the chair in the same manner), freeing her ankles. The chair releases, falling away. INT. REMY' S JET - CONTINUOUS Templar turns to the cockpit storage hatches behind him. He yanks open one designated: PARACHUTES. REMY SAMARKAND Don't! TWO HUGE TOUCANS fly out of the hatch. They flap around the cockpit. Templar looks askance at Remy... TEMPLAR Remy... REMY SAMARKAND I get ten grand for them in Paris. Maybe a Russian would pay more? Templar grabs a PARACHUTE PACK and races to the back of the plane. He YANKS OPEN the EMERGENCY EXIT DOOR. Cold air blasts his face. TEMPLAR Put down in Helsinki and wait for my call! And Templar jumps and -- CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS An autumn day in Peter the Great's city. Peaceful. Normal. Pedestrians walk the streets. [note: St. Petersburg is called "Venice of the North" because it's built atop marshy islands connected by canals. There are over 400 bridges; on the canals, boat traffic is often as dense as automobile traffic.] A WOMAN, glancing up, notices something. WOMAN (Russian) Look. (points skyward) Look! Other pedestrians stop. They, too, look up at -- A PARACHUTIST (Jillian of course) descending into the heart of the city! And down she comes, landing hard in the middle of an intersection. TAXIS and AUTOMOBILES swerve aside, nearly killing her. Others SCREECH to a stop. JILLIAN gets to her feet, wild-eyed and frantic, tangled in cord and parachute silk. She looks around at -- CROWDS OF PEDESTRIANS staring at her. JILLIAN Help me. I'm American. Police! A ST. PETERSBURG POLICE CRUISER comes through the intersection to a stop. A YOUNG COP, just 20, hangs up his c.b. radio and gets out. He approaches Jillian. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - PETER AND PAUL FORTRESS CITY PARK Across the Neva River from Jillian is a city park with a HUGE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF PETER THE GREAT. Under the statue, two OLD RUSSIAN GEEZERS are playing chess, smoking pipes, arguing, etc. Down TEMPLAR comes. The parachute snags on the BRONZE HORSE'S HEAD. Templar dangles 15 feet off the ground. He looks at the GEEZERS directly below. Hello there. TEMPLAR Sorry about this. He shrugs off the parachute pack and falls, landing on the chess board, scuttling the pieces. The Geezers fall backward on their behinds. Templar gets to his feet, gaining his bearings, looking for Jillian. He takes off running. INT. POLICE SEDAN, DRIVING - CONTINUOUS - DAY Jillian sits in the back seat, catching her breath. The Young Cop looks at her in the rear-view mirror. JILLIAN Do you speak English? YOUNG RUSSIAN COP Yes. Some. JILLIAN Thank God. (takes a deep breath, composes herself) I'm an American scientist. Last night, in New York, a man stole something from me, then this morning I was kidnapped by my lab assistant, god this sounds like a bad novel . . . . . Suddenly a ROCK bounces off the windshield. JILLIAN What was that? EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - DAY The police cruiser moves past A THRONG OF MICHAEL ROMANOV SUPPORTERS carrying placards and banners. They begin pelting the cruiser with rocks and bottles. INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY The cruiser clears the Romanov supporters. Rocks and bottles smash on the back windshield. YOUNG RUSSIAN COP There could be revolution maybe. City very dangerous. IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD - TWO OTHER POLICE CRUISERS pull into the street, blocking it. The Young Russian Cop brakes; the cruiser comes to a stop in front of the other cruisers. An OLDER RUSSIAN COP, followed by a PLAINCLOTHESMAN, approach the young cop's cruiser. EXT. TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY TEMPLAR sprints across the Neva River Bridge connecting the Peter and Paul Park with downtown St. Petersburg. He suddenly stops short, seeing -- TEMPLAR' S POV - TWO BLOCKS AWAY -- JILLIAN in the cruiser, the Older Cop and the plainclothesman approaching. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - INTERSECTION - DAY The Older Cop leans in the window. OLDER COP (Russian) Is this her? YOUNG COP (Russian) Yes sir Sergeant Ravik. The plainclothesman emerges from behind the Older Cop. In one shocking, effortless motion, he places a silenced handgun to the Young Cop's head and squeezes the trigger. Blood spatters the windshield. JILLIAN gasps in horror at the plainclothesman. It is...ILYA. The Older Cop opens the door, shoving the Young Cop's corpse to the passenger side. Ilya gets in back next to Jillian, pressing the HANDGUN into her ribs. The cruiser ROARS off into St. Petersburg traffic. EXT. AT THE FOOT OF TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS TEMPLAR looks around. He sees A MOTORCYCLE STAND filled with MOTORCYCLES. Runs to it. Chooses a big, powerful, Honda street machine. He pulls out his burglar's tools; jams one in the ignition. He has it running in seconds. He throws it in gear and ROARS off. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - CONTINUOUS - DAY Templar blasts through traffic on the Honda. He's on a street parallel to Jillian's. AT AN INTERSECTION Templar looks to his right, where he can see, one block over on the parallel street -- THE POLICE CRUISER moving through traffic. Templar guns the motorcycle. The engine WHINES. He races ahead, accelerating through the gears. AT THE NEXT INTERSECTION - TEMPLAR throws the cycle into a skidding, hair-raising turn. He's going 'round the block to cut off the sedan. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - DAY The police cruiser moves through the intersection. Suddenly TEMPLAR'S MOTORCYCLE, Templar-less, veers into the path of the cruiser. The cruiser hits it head on. The motorcycle rides up the cruiser's hood and smashes through the front windshield. The cruiser careens out of control. It fishtails twice and crashes into A STREETLIGHT POLE. INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - DAY UP FRONT, the Older Cop is unconscious; he's taken the full brunt of the motorcycle through the windshield. IN THE BACK, Ilya is groggy, semi-conscious. JILLIAN is reeling also; there's a gash on her forehead. The BACK PASSENGER DOOR jerks open. TEMPLAR lunges inside. Ilya raises his gun but he's weak, disoriented. Templar yanks it from his hand and pistol whips him. This has all happened so fast. Jillian looks at Ilya then at Templar... JILLIAN What...? WHO...? And Templar yanks Jillian out. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS - DAY The intersection is chaos: PEDESTRIANS running up, surrounding the police cruiser, vehicles stopping, etc. Templar, virtually dragging Jillian, plows through the crowd, passing a Russian Army Corporal who's just gotten out of his ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK. RUSSIAN ARMY CORPORAL (Russian) Let me help! TEMPLAR (Russian) (pointing back at the police sedan) Help them! The Corporal runs to the smashed cruiser, and -- TEMPLAR and JILLIAN run to the Corporal's SUPPLY TRUCK. INT. RUSSIAN ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK - DAY The driver's side door opens. In comes Jillian, then Templar. Templar shoves Jillian across the front seat and gets in, behind the wheel. He floors it. They accelerate into traffic. Templar looks at Jillian. She's trembling, staring catatonically straight ahead. JILLIAN Who are you. Tell me who you are and what the hell is going on. TEMPLAR I was hired to steal your research, but you know that by now. You left the critical data off the disk. Where is it? memorized, right? (she doesn't answer) That's a bad cut. Here. He hands her his HANDKERCHIEF. She swats it away. TEMPLAR Look, you're in big trouble. The guy who hired me will do anything to get your research. Once he has it, you're a corpse. Give me the missing data and I'll get you out of here. You can trust me. She stares at him in disbelief. JILLIAN Trust you? (chews the word) Trust you...? She grabs the door handle and yanks it open. Templar grabs her arm, pulling her back. They wrestle back and forth... TEMPLAR Damn it, don't be stupid...! She picks up the CORPORAL'S STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE, sitting in a holder on the console between them, and throws it in Templar's face. TEMPLAR ARGGH! Templar recoils, blinded, releasing Jillian. He jerks the steering wheel to the side and stomps on the brakes. JILLIAN lunges out before the supply truck fully stops. She hits the pavement running. She hurries off, blending into the crowded sidewalk. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS Templar gets out, cursing, wiping the hot liquid from his eyes. He looks around. Runs off in Jillian's direction, abandoning the supply truck. CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - LOMONOSOVA AVENUE Templar, running, out of breath, rounds a corner onto Lomonosova Avenue, in the city's shopping district. It's jammed with PEDESTRIANS, SHOPPERS, MERCHANTS, etc. Templar moves through the crowd, eyes scanning left and right. There's no sign of Jillian. Then he sees her. Just a glimpse. 50 yards ahead. Moving through the crowded sidewalk toward the FONTANKA (the largest and most beautiful of the city's grand canals). EXT. LOMONOSOVA AVENUE - FONTANKA CANAL BRIDGE - SUNSET Templar runs over the Fontanka Canal Bridge. Nothing. He comes back the other way. Nothing. He stops in the middle of the bridge, exhausted, out of breath. Below him, passing under the bridge, all types of WATER CONVEYANCES (skiffs, barges, dinghies, etc) are navigating the canal. And emerging from underneath the bridge, seated in the back of a WATER TAXI,...is Jillian. Templar races off the bridge. EXT. FONTANKA CANAL - EMBANKMENT PROMENADE - SUNSET Templar sprints down the sidewalk promenade next to the canal. The water taxi is 50 yards past the bridge. JILLIAN sees him coming. TEMPLAR closes the gap. 30 yards. 20 yards. Now 10. Now he's running alongside the taxi, staring at Jillian. And she stares back at him, stony, expressionless. The canal is wider now, and the water taxi accelerates, pulling away from the slower skiffs. Templar slows to a jog. He stops, lungs heaving. The sun is setting to the west. The water taxi speeds off into the setting sun, leaving Templar with this image of Jillian: eyes unblinking, staring at him with pure, unadulterated hatred. CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT Night is falling. Down the street from Tretiak's headquarters, A FEDERAL EXPRESS VAN rolls up to a traffic light. INT. FEDERAL EXPRESS VAN - NIGHT FRANKIE has arrived in St. Petersburg. She sits at the wheel in a Federal Express uniform. She pulls out a charge of C-4 plastique with a timer. She opens the van door; tosses it into a sidewalk TRASH RECEPTACLE. She accelerates through the light, now green, and takes a left into TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS, parking behind a LIMOUSINE which has just entered. The limousine's doors open. Several dark-suited men get out. One of them is IVAN GRACHA (the Russian mafia figure shown on the C.N.N. broadcast). INT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE - NIGHT A MAP OF ST. PETERSBURG AND OUTLYING REGIONS is spread out on Tretiak's desk. Tretiak, Ilya, Zubov, and ten men are present. ILYA There could be another solution. The woman is not-the only scientist working in this field. Is she? Tretiak turns to Zubov, who nods. ZUBOV No. There are others. TRETIAK Get on a plane. Leave tonight. The door opens. Zero, the huge bodyguard, enters. ZERO Gracha is here. Tretiak goes immediately to his desk, pressing the "RECORD" BUTTON on a v.c.r. within. The surveillance camera in Tretiak's office begins taping the meeting. IVAN GRACHA and six bodyguards enter. GRACHA This had better be important. It's my wife's birthday. TRETIAK My apologies to your wife. GRACHA An apology from Tretiak? An historic moment. TRETIAK (placating) Come now, Ivan, why must we feud. GRACHA We feud because we hate each other. TRETIAK It is true there have been harsh words between us. We are rivals. But rivalry is bad for business. Upon what conditions would you accept a partnership? Be reasonable. GRACHA Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. TRETIAK Agreed. (they shake hands) I need the men in your areas, Ivan, for two days. Particularly Moscow and points South. GRACHA Why? Tretiak hands TWO PHOTOGRAPHS to Gracha. One is of JILLIAN, taken somewhere in Westchester, wearing her "atomic" jacket. The second is an Interpol photo taken of TEMPLAR in a cafe in Amsterdam. TRETIAK To find this woman... and kill this man. GRACHA (smiles) This is a private matter, I take it. (Tretiak smiles) Then you'll have them. TRETIAK Ilya - some wine for Ivan Gracha. INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NI GHT TWO GUARDS man the guard station, eyeing the bank of six video monitors. Frankie enters with a big DELIVERY BOX. FRANKIE (Russian) Delivery. Frankie hands Guard 1 the box and hands Guard 2 a clipboard for his signature. Frankie looks at the surveillance monitors and raises an eyebrow. ON TRETIAK'S OFFICE MONITOR - we see Tretiak with Ivan Gracha raising a toast. In the screen's lower corner are the letters "REC." The meeting is being taped. EXT. NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT. THE C-4 in the trash receptacle blows. It blows up TWO CARS and A TREE. A monstrously concussive explosion. INT. TRETIAK' S OFFI CE Gracha drops his wine glass; it shatters on the floor. Gracha and his men unholster their weapons. Tretiak's men go for theirs. A tense stand-off. GRACHA What is this, Tretiak? TRETIAK Put your guns down. Tretiak goes to his desk; stabs an intercom button -- INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT The guards, save one, barge out the front door. The remaining guard answers the intercom, leaving FRANKIE unattended by the surveillance monitors. Her hand moves to THE CO-AXIAL CABLE behind the video monitors, yanking it. She plugs a TRANSMITTOR into the monitor, then replugs the co-axial cable into the transmitter. The guard turns to Frankie. FRANKIE What was that? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREET - NIGHT TEMPLAR stands in a shop doorway. He pulls out his homing device. Adjusts the screen. INSERT - THE HOMING DEVICE The computerized screen now shows the ST. PETERSBURG CITY GRID. Two pulses: 1) a fixed pulse (Templar) and 2) a moving pulse (Jillian) on the other side of town. Templar turns his collar up; walks off into the night. EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS - NIGHT TEMPLAR comes down a street in a scummy part of town. A GUY in a doorway swigs a vodka bottle, looking dangerously at Templar. A few PROSTITUTES pass. Templar pulls out the homing device. INSERT - THE HOMING DEVICE - The MOVING PULSE is one block from Templar, emanating from inside a huge building, the NEVSKY RAIL STATION. BACK TO SCENE - Templar pockets the homing device and walks across the street to the train station. INT. NEVSKY STATION - MAIN CONCOURSE - NIGHT An enormous facility, 100 yards long with a vaulted ceiling and entrances at the north and south ends. Templar-enters from the north, looking around. He walks quickly to the center of the station concourse. STATION LOUDSPEAKER (v.o.) Next train to Moscow boarding on platform 8. Templar approaches Platform 8. Passengers are boarding the next train to Moscow. Against the wall, a gang of ten PROSTITUTES are smoking, drinking vodka, laughing. Templar freezes. JILLIAN is with the prostitutes. Her back's to Templar, but it's her. Same "atomic" jacket, the shoes Templar gave her, same height, same weight. ... Templar isn't the only one who's spotted her... TWO MEN IN BLACK TRENCHCOATS, obviously Tretiak's men, are converging upon Jillian from the other direction. They haven't yet seen Templar... Templar moves off quickly, drawing his gun. As Tretiak's men move in for the kill. TEMPLAR falls in behind them, WHIPPING the barrel of his gun over one, then the other. They fall, unconscious. The PROSTITUTES, alarmed, whirl around and... ...It's not Jillian. Templar, thunderstruck, looks at THE PROSTITUTE'S feet. She's wearing JILLIAN'S SHOES and JACKET. On her wrist is JILLIAN'S WRISTWATCH. Templar turns. The TRAIN TO MOSCOW is pulling out of the station. ... Templar sprints away, back toward the station concourse. It's all clear now; Jillian sold her clothes and watch and bought a ticket to Moscow. EXT. NEVSKY STATION - NIGHT AUTOMOBILES are parked in front of the station. Templar picks a B.M.W. out come the burglar's tools. Templar's through the door lock in two seconds. He gets in and shoves a tool in the ignition lock. CUT TO: INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN B.M.W. - NIGHT Templar speeds down the highway, moving in and out of traffic. His cellular phone chirps. He unpockets it, clicks it on. FRANKIE Simon. Good news. INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT In the b.g. through a window, we see Tretiak's headquarters looming down the street. Frankie sits in front of six VIDEO MONITORS like those in Tretiak's headquarters; they are receiving the video transmissions from Tretiak's surveillance cameras. We see exteriors, Zubov's lab, corridors, etc. Frankie is looking at A MONITOR OF TRETIAK'S OFFICE; Tretiak is pacing, talking on the phone. FRANKIE They haven't found her and they don't know where she is. INTERCUT - FRANKIE IN HOTEL/TEMPLAR DRIVING TEMPLAR She's on a train to Moscow. FRANKIE That's bad news. They're 'stopping every train leaving the city. TEMPLAR Call you later, Frankie. Templar tosses the phone and jerks the wheel. The B.M.W. veers wildly across three lanes of traffic, swerving off the highway down an exit ramp. CUT TO: EXT. ROAD SOUTH OF ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT The St. Petersburg city outskirts. Templar's B.M.W. rounds a corner onto a two-lane road running next to the Moscow line train tracks. INT. TEMPLAR'S B.M.W - NIGHT Templar stares ahead through the windshield. TEMPLAR'S POV - THE TRAIN TRACKS - A half mile ahead is a street crossing. We see the blinking caboose lights of the TRAIN TO MOSCOW. It's stopped at an intersection in front of TWO BLACK SEDANS parked across the tracks. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - NIGHT JILLIAN sits alone, looking around nervously, wondering why the hell the train's stopped. Her hair is brushed over the gash on her forehead. She wears the prostitute's ratty jacket and shoes. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS Two of Tretiak's men enter the first passenger car, heads swiveling back and forth, checking every passenger's face. EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CAR - NIGHT Templar runs up to the rear passenger car. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS - NIGHT Tretiak's men come through the third car. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CARS - NIGHT Templar comes the other way looking for Jillian. Through one car and into the next. He sees JILLIAN. This time it is her. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS - NIGHT On come Tretiak's men, into another car. They're one car away now... INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - JILLIAN'S CAR JILLIAN sits up in her seat; she looks through the connecting door into the next car, which TRETIAK'S MEN are entering. She rises to flee, running into -- -- TEMPLAR. Jillian's eyes bulge. She's going to scream. Templar clamps her mouth and shoves her forward to the exit door which opens to the parallel tracks. Templar wrenches open the door and sticks his head outside, looking down the tracks. We hear a TRAIN WHISTLE and RUMBLING WHEELS. Templar comes back inside. TRETIAK'S MEN are half-way through the next car and approaching fast. TEMPLAR We're going to jump. Okay? Jillian, terrified, wide-eyed, nods. And they jump. EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - PARALLEL TRACKS Templar and Jillian lunge from the train onto the parallel tracks. A train whistle BLARES. Jillian looks up; her face contorts with shock at -- A TRAIN bearing down on them at 60 m.p.h. 100 feet. Now 70. 50. Jesus, it's right on top of them... TEMPLAR grabs her hand and yanks her across the tracks with 10 feet to go. The TRAIN SCREAMS past them. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - DAY TRETIAK'S MEN enter the car where Jillian was. Outside, the St. Petersburg train flashes by, blocking any view of Templar and Jillian on the other side of the tracks. They continue down the aisle, into the next car. EXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - PARALLEL TRACKS The train to St. Petersburg is gone. Jillian stares at Templar with hateful eyes. He gets up and yanks her to her feet. Pulls her back toward the train to Moscow. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CAR - NIGHT A GERMAN BUSINESSMAN is having a heated conversation on a cellular phone. Outside, we see TRETIAK'S MEN walking toward their vehicles. Templar and Jillian enter the private berth across from the businessman. It has reclining chairs and a curtain for privacy. The train BEGINS MOVING again. Templar and Jillian sit, regarding each other. TEMPLAR You can't get rid of me. JILLIAN Like a bad flu. TEMPLAR Pretty smart, selling the clothes and watch. You were going for the U.S. embassy, weren't you? JILLIAN Present tense please  I am going. Before we discuss the present, let's discuss the past. She stares hard, malevolently at him. JILLIAN Who the hell are you. I want full name, address, profession, and don't - don't - say Michael Quinn of 112 Mason Street, shoemaker. TEMPLAR My name is Simon Templar. I don't have an address because I live in hotels. I'm a professional thief. JILLIAN Good. We're getting somewhere. I'd like to respond to that. The German Businessman is looking at them. Jillian pulls the curtain shut. Then she SLAPS Templar, hard, across the face. JILLIAN You wicked man. (slaps him again. You liar. (slaps him again) Thief. She draws back to slap him again. He catches her arm. They freeze this way, faces inches apart. She's trembling, her face a mask of hatred. JILLIAN I hope you rot in hell. He lets go of her. She stands up. TEMPLAR Where are you going? JILLIAN As far away from you as I can. Templar pulls out his 9mm pistol. TEMPLAR Sit down. Jillian stares at the gun. JILLIAN You're joking. TEMPLAR Michael Quinn jokes. I don't. She glares at him. Slowly sits. Templar pulls out his cellular phone. Punches numbers. TEMPLAR Remy. Be at Moscow Airport at eight a.m., fueled and ready to go. Templar clicks off the phone and pockets it. Then he pockets the gun, its barrel pointing at Jillian through his jacket. With his free hand he grabs her arm and puts it under his arm, clamping it to his body. TEMPLAR We're going to sit here and not make a scene. I'd get some rest. Templar leans back, shutting his eyes. TEMPLAR I sleep light. Jillian, out of the corner of her eye, notices something through the curtain... ACROSS THE AISLE - THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN is folding up his cellular phone and stuffing it in his satchel briefcase on the floor. He leans back and closes his eyes. The satchel briefcase sticks into the aisle. Close enough for Jillian to touch... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BENARES, INDIA - ESTABLISHING - MORNING The exquisite, astonishing city on the Ganges River. EXT. BENARES - UNIVERSITY OF BENARES A courtyard in the traditional Indian style. Zubov and two of Tretiak's men approach a building. Zubov rings the doorbell. Seconds pass. The door opens. An Indian gentleman peers out. He's about 50, in a madras shirt and nehru jacket. This is DR. VIJAY SINGH, whose taped lecture we heard in Jillian's station wagon. ZUBOV Dr. Singh? Dr. Vijay Singh? VIJAY SINGH Who are you and what do you want? ZUBOV My name is Vapin Zubov. I would like to discuss something with... VIJAY SINGH (scowls) Come back at a decent hour... Dr. Singh begins to shut the door. Zubov puts his hand in the door, jamming it. ZUBOV I would like to discuss cold fusion, Doctor. Dr. Singh's demeanor changes. Pushes open the door. VIJAY SINGH Come in. CUT TO: INT. THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW - MORNING PASSENGERS are yawning, pulling up their window blinds. Sunlight streams in. A PORTER passes by. . PORTER Thirty minutes to Moscow, thirty minutes... The Porter moves past the German Businessman; he's asleep and snoring. Across the aisle -- JILLIAN'S EYES are darting from the German Businessman, to TEMPLAR, who's looking out the window. JILLIAN I need to use the ladies' room. I think you can trust me to... TEMPLAR I don't trust anybody. Jillian gives Templar a disgusted look. She rises and moves into the aisle. Ternplar follows. JILLIAN Tell me something. How much were you paid? TEMPLAR It's not your business. Move. JILLIAN I think it is. C'mon. Tell me. TEMPLAR Fifteen million dollars, but it didn't work out. Did it. They pass a PORTER serving snacks (fruits and cheeses) from a cart. Jillian looks' at the cart. JILLIAN Does it bother you? What you do? TEMPLAR No. JILLIAN You have no conscience? No sense of morality? TEMPLAR Define morality. JILLIAN It's a commonly used and generally understood word. TEMPLAR Not by me. . They've arrived outside the LADIES ROOM. Jillian opens the door, begins to enter. TEMPLAR Wait. JILLIAN You are not going in there with me. Templar brushes past her, leaving the door open. He steps up on the toilet, examining the WINDOW above. JILLIAN Okay, how about: Do unto others as they would do unto you. TEMPLAR How about: Do unto others before they do unto you. Templar pulls up the window. It opens only five inches; it's prevented from rising further by TWO SAFETY SCREWS drilled through the frame. JILLIAN How about: love thy neighbor. TEMPLAR The man who said that was crucified by his. Satisfied, Templar steps down and walks back to Jillian. She shakes her head, laughs mirthlessly. JILLIAN Were you raised by wolves? Who were your parents, Lucretia Borgia and the Marquis de Sader TEMPLAR The two people in question weren't as nice as that. I wouldn't know. I never met them. Are you through? It's all yours. She gives him a look and shoves past him into -- THE LADIES ROOM Jillian enters, closes the door and locks it. She stands on the toilet and examines the window. Sees the safety screws. She steps down. She turns on the sink, then kneels and pulls up her pantleg, revealing THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN'S CELLULAR PHONE stuffed in her sock. She pulls it out. She turns the sink on full blast, creating as much noise as she can, and punches numbers. JILLIAN International operator please. (pause) The American Embassy in Moscow, please. Jillian waits for the call to connect and CUT TO: INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CAR - AISLES Jillian exits the ladies' room. JILLIAN You really will rot in hell, know that? TEMPLAR Good, all my friends will be waiting for me. They move down the aisle, passing the SERVING PORTER, Jillian's hand dangles over the fruit and cheese cart. She plucks up a SERVING KNIFE with two fingers and slides it up her sleeve. JILLIAN Friends? I thought you trusted no one. TEMPLAR I don't. Give it to me. JILLIAN (innocently) What. TEMPLAR The knife you just took. Jillian sighs. Pulls the serving knife out of her sleeve and hands it over. When she turns back toward her berth, she doesn't like what she sees -- THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN has woken up. He's yawning, opening up a stack of business correspondence sitting on the armrest of his chair with a LETTER OPENER. JILLIAN continues down the aisle, sweating it out. If the guy discovers that his phone is missing... Each step is a mile. Finally Jillian and Templar come to their berth. The German Businessman is reading a letter. The letter opener is sitting on the stack of unopened letters. Jillian "accidentally" knocks the stack of letters and letter opener off the armrest. They fall to the floor next to the German Businessman's satchel briefcase. Jillian quickly drops to a kneeling position and begins gathering up all the letters. JILLIAN I'm so sorry! As Jillian rises and hands the German Businessman his letters, we see that  THE CELLULAR PHONE is back in the German Businessman's satchel briefcase. Templar and Jillian sit down. CUT TO: EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING The train pulls into the station. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - MORNING The Porter comes down the aisle, calling out: PORTER Moscow Station, Moscow Station! Templar and Jillian move with the other passengers toward the exits. As they pass the ladies' room: JILLIAN Give me a second, will you? I don't feel well. TEMPLAR Make it quick. Jillian goes in the bathroom. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES' ROOM Jillian enters and stands on the toilet. Out comes the German Businessman's LETTER OPENER. She centers the opener in one of the screw heads, leans into it, and twists. She begins unscrewing it. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - AISLE OUTSIDE LADIES' ROOM Templar is impatiently looking at the ladies' room door. The passengers are filing past him. He knocks on the door. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES' ROOM Jillian's got one screw out. The other is coming. Templar KNOCKS again. JILLIAN Just a second. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - AISLE OUTSIDE LADIES' ROOM Templar knocks again, LOUDER. No response inside. The German Businessman passes by him... GERMAN BUSINESSMAN Porter, I seem to have lost my letter opener... Templar stares at the guy. INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES ROOM The door SMASHES open, splintering the lock. Templar bursts in. Something instantly gets his attention. The fully opened window. And no Jillian... Templar bolts out. CUT TO: INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, MAIN CONCOURSE - MORNING Jillian hurries up the escalator to the main concourse. A stupendous, vaulted interior. As impressive as Grand Central in New York or Victoria in London. She moves through the crowd. Eyes scanning everything and nothing. She bumps into A COMMUTER, who scowls. Jillian takes cover by one of the immense marble pillars. She pulls her collar up. Waits it out. ACROSS THE CONCOURSE - A MAN studies her. He's tall, blonde, looks like he played linebacker for Ohio State. He approaches. She eyes him. Everyone is a potential enemy. But this guy is obviously American. BLONDE MAN Ms. St. Thomas? Jillian? JILLIAN Yes. The Blonde Man opens his wallet, flipping out his EMBASSY BADGE and C. I. A. CREDENTIALS. WHITEHEAD John Whitehead, Special Agent, Central Intelligence Agency. Was your trip all right? JILLIAN Yes it was fine, oh who cares, I'm finally safe... (squeezes his hand) Do you have a car? WHITEHEAD Yes, outside. First I'd like to ask you some questions. That was an interesting story you told the embassy. JILLIAN Interesting? It's true. WHITEHEAD Please understand: the United States Embassy receives fifty calls a day. My husband's been murdered, my daughter's been sold into white slavery, you get the idea. So before we waste a lot of people's time, Ms. St. Thomas, you say you have p.h.d.s in chemistry and nuclear physics. What's the atomic symbol for, say. ..gold? Pause. Jillian stares at Whitehead. JILLIAN You've gotta be kidding me... CUT TO: INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING Templar dashes across the platform, looking everywhere. Jillian has vanished. Suddenly his cellular phone chirps. He unpockets it and clicks it on. TEMPLAR Talk to me, Frankie. INT. ST. PETERSBURG - FRANKIE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING FRANKIE, red-eyed and drinking coffee, is staring at the video transmission from Tretiak's office. Tretiak and Ilya are talking. . INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO (as deemed necessary) FRANKIE She called the U.S. Embassy a half hour ago. TEMPLAR What? (considers this) Does Tretiak know? FRANKIE Simon, the U.S. Embassy has more leaks than a Polish submarine. Who do you think intercepted the call? As FRANKIE says that, she doubletakes at the monitor showing Tretiak's office. Frankie's eyes widen. ON THE VIDEO MONITOR - A THIRD MAN has entered the room. It is the crusading reformer, MICHAEL ROMANOV. Frankie stabs a button on a tape recorder next to her monitors. It begins taping the transmission from Tretiak's office. TEMPLAR Thanks, Frankie. FRANKIE Simon, wait. . . . CLICK. Frankie turns some dials, bringing into ZOOM FOCUS Tretiak and Romanov. She ups the volume. We hear this: TRETIAK Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the Fatherland. How will that sound to the average Russian? FRANKIE (a whisper) I don't believe it... CUT TO: INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - ESCALATOR - DAY TEMPLAR runs up the escalator, plowing through the disembarking passengers, taking two stairs at a time. INT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, MAIN CONCOURSE - MORNING Templar comes off the escalator. The place is packed with COMMUTERS. He moves off, eyes darting in all directions for Jillian, while meanwhile  ACROSS THE CONCOURSE, BY THE PILLAR - CONTINUOUS JILLIAN . ..Cd, that's big "C" little "d," cadmium's valence is 2, its atomic number is 48 and its atomic weight is 112.411 or would you like that carried out five more decimal places? Good enough? WHITEHEAD (smiles) Good enough. Come this way, Ms. St. Thomas. He ushers her off. As they move from behind the pillar, 50 yards away -- ACROSS THE CONCOURSE - TEMPLAR sees Jillian and Whitehead. He looks around, thinking. He sprints for the side exit. EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - MAIN ENTRANCE/EXIT - DAY The circular drive where travelers are picked up and deposited by taxis, buses, automobiles. Jillian and Whitehead exit the station. AHEAD - TWO MERCEDES SEDANS are waiting. Several darksuited MEN stand next to an open back door. JILLIAN (shakes her head) What a nightmare.. To think my work could just be taken from me... WHITEHEAD You're safe now, Doctor St. Thomas. We'll have you back in New York in no time. They continue toward the parked Mercedes. Suddenly Jillian blinks. She sees something. It's TEMPLAR, driving a Russian sedan. He rolls to a stop across the circular drive, staring a hole right through Jillian, grimly shaking his head at her, trying to warn her... JILLIAN Agent Whitehead... Whitehead looks at Jillian. Pause. Jillian eyes Templar across the drive. AGENT WHITEHEAD Yes? Jillian looks at the men waiting by the Mercedes. She looks at two Moscow police officers standing to the side. Something's wrong. Something doesn't feel right. AGENT WHITEHEAD Ms. St. Thomas? You had a question? They're drawing closer to the waiting Mercedes... JILLIAN Nothing, I was just thinking that when my research was stolen I felt like the Buffalo Bills after they lost four World Series. WHITEHEAD Hah hah, I bet you did. I'm a baseball fan too hah hah... Jillian looks at him differently. The Buffalo Bills lost four Super Bowls, Whitehead. They continue toward the waiting sedans. JILLIAN'S EYES dart around. Her forehead is sweaty. And she bolts from him, taking Whitehead by surprise. JILLIAN sprints across the circular drive for Templar's car, Whitehead after her. The men by the waiting Mercedes converge on Jillian from the side. TEMPLAR throws open the passenger side door for Jillian. The men coming from the Mercedes open fire on Templar, blowing in the sedan's side window. Templar ducks. JILLIAN'S almost there... She reaches the open sedan and dives inside. She tries to shut the door; WHITEHEAD gets hold of it. JILLIAN SCREAMS at Templar. JILLIAN Go! Templar floors it. The car SQUEALS away from the curb. Whitehead runs alongside, trying to get the door open. The car accelerates. Whitehead sprints but can't keep up. His feet leave the ground; he clings to the doorframe through the blown-out window. Whitehead pulls his gun from his shoulder holster and aims across Jillian's body at Templar. His finger squeezes the trigger as Jillian shoves his hand up. BULLETS blow holes in the roof of the car. JILLIAN hits Whitehead, hard, in the head. Whitehead's head snaps back. She hits him again. Whitehead falls away from the car. He rolls twenty feet and stops, dazed but alive. INT. TEMPLAR' S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY Templar guns the sedan through a RED LIGHT. Cars to the left and right SCREECH to a stop. The sedan flies on... JILLIAN TAKE ME TO THE EMBASSY. TEMPLAR We're going to the airport. Templar guns the accelerator. EXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - CIRCULAR DRIVE - DAY The TWO MERCEDES pull up to Whitehead, who staggers to his feet. He gets in the lead Mercedes; the two cars race off after Templar and Jillian. INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY Templar floors it through another intersection. he looks in his rear view mirror. There's no sign of the two Mercedes. They've escaped. TEMPLAR Good. JILLIAN Is it? Who's worse  them or you? Templar looks down and registers shock -- - - IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD, A BLIND MAN with a walking stick is tap tapping across the intersection. Jillian cringes, expecting the worst. Templar throws the steering wheel and -- EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY -- The sedan swerves, clearing the BLIND MAN by two inches, skidding wildly through the intersection. INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY Templar fights the wheel but he's losing... The skid can't be corrected. Jillian SCREAMS. EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY The sedan slides sideways, hits the curb and flips over, spinning like a top across the sidewalk. CUT TO: INT. WHITEHEAD'S MERCEDES - DAY The Mercedes moves through traffic. Whitehead and the other men look around. The Mercedes rounds a corner. Across the intersection is the OVERTURNED SEDAN on the sidewalk, surrounded by gawking PEDESTRIANS. EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION The Mercedes pulls up. Whitehead and his men get out. They warily approach the sedan, drawing guns. The pedestrians back off, getting the hell out of the way. Whitehead and his men surround the car. They kneel, guns trained inside...Templar and Jillian are gone. Whitehead barks at his men. WHITEHEAD Fifteen block radius. Go house to house. Whitehead looks around at the surrounding buildings. We FOCUS on one of them, a RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH several blocks away, under scaffolding and mesh wire, in the process of renovation. CAMERA pushes in on the church's HUGE ONION SHAPED TURRET. . . . . INT. MOSCOW - RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH  and we're in the turret's interior: round, with stained glass windows, a desk and chair. A trap door leading to the vestibule below BANGS OPEN. JILLIAN comes up, followed by Templar, his gun in hand. They're cut and bruised, exhausted. Jillian slumps against the wall, shivering. Templar puts his equipment on the desk and goes to each of the windows. From this elevation he can see the entire city. TEMPLAR'S FIRST POV - RED SQUARE, a mile across town, where a thousand Muscovites are listening to a pro Michael Romanov speech. Shifting from Red Square to the city outskirts, we see MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, where Remy waits. TEMPLAR'S SECOND POV - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY is just a few blocks away - we see the American flag flying from the roof stanchion. In the intersections around the embassy, Tretiak's men stand by their vehicles, watching. Every point of access to the embassy is sealed. We see WHITEHEAD. A Mercedes pulls up to him. ILYA gets out. TEMPLAR The embassy's surrounded. BACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN is staring at Templar's computer. The modem is engaging. JILLIAN sits up, staring at the screen. Jillian reads an ELECTRONIC MESSAGE which appears: BEAR CONTACTING LION. GIVE HER TO ME. IN RETURN, 20 MILLION AND SAFE PASSAGE. IF YOU REFUSE YOU WILL DIE. Jillian's eyes grow wide with terror. Templar looks out a third window. TEMPLAR'S THIRD POV - Tretiak's men are going building to building in a fifteen block radius sweep, closing in on the church. TEMPLAR The airport's out. They're drawing a noose around us. We don't have much time. TEMPLAR turns away from the window. He sees Jillian looking at his computer. He walks over to it and reads the message. Jillian gets slowly to her feet, watching Templar. JILLIAN's mouth quivers as Templar types: LION CONSIDERING OFFER. Templar looks at Jillian. She stares back. A long moment. Neither moves. JILLIAN What are you going to do? Tell me. I deserve at least that. (desperate now) I'll die. If you take their offer, they'll kill me. TEMPLAR And if I don't, they'll kill me. Interesting situation I'd say. Jillian sinks to the chair, her voice shaking. JILLIAN Oh god. It's over, it's all over... You're not human. You're an animal. TEMPLAR I'm a businessman. I perform services for profit. And spare me the lecture. You didn't spend ten years in that mildewed basement for the good of humanity, you did it to get rich. Richer than anyone on earth. Richer than God. (beat) I'll make you an offer - pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties - should come to about one month's. . . Pause. She slowly looks up at him. JILLIAN I don't hold the patent rights to cold fusion. TEMPLAR What? JILLIAN You fool. Don't you understand? (her voice cracks; she begins to softly cry) It wasn't about money, it wasn't about becoming rich... TEMPLAR If you don't own the patent rights, who does? JILLIAN A foundation in my name. The royalties were going to go to scientific research, curing cancer, .. .christ how can you understand this... She lowers her head, weeping openly. CAMERA PUSHES in on Templar, staring at her. Even the darkest of men have a seed of goodness. Here, for the first time, does it flower in Simon Templar. But we don't know this. Templar betrays nothing. He picks up his homing device and clicks it on. He types in this command: MOSCOW. The device beeps; THE MOSCOW STREET GRID appears. He types a new command: SUBTERRANEAN DATA. Moscow's SUBTERRANEAN GRID appears superimposed over the street grid; we see the guts of the city; the Moscow subway, water and gas mains, etc. In a corner of the screen is a TABLE OF SCHEDULES. Templar analyzes the information on the screen. He quickly rises; goes to Jillian, pulling off his belt. He pulls her up. She stands limply, still weeping, no longer resisting. He's bigger and stronger, there's no use. Templar gathers Jillian's wrists together and ties them with the belt. He pulls her to the trapdoor and CUT TO: EXT. MOSCOW - SIDEWALK Several pedestrians walk by. Templar walks Jillian quickly to a MANHOLE COVER. He kneels and hoists the cover off. He points into the hole. Jillian, her wrists bound, steps down uneasily, her feet finding the top rung of a STEEL LADDER. She descends into the manhole. Templar follows. INT. MOSCOW - SUBTERRANEAN SEWER SYSTEM - DAY Jillian and Templar come down the ladder, dropping to the steel-gridded walkway over the Moscow sewer. Templar pulls Jillian twenty feet down the walkway. At this point in the wall there is a HATCH with a compression HATCHWHEEL, the turning of which opens the hatch, like on a submarine. Within the hatch we hear RUSHING WATER. TEMPLAR That's a municipal water main. In one hour you're going in there. Templar pulls out a SWITCHBLADE. Clicks it on. Jillian, shivering with terror, stares at the blade... TEMPLAR Listen. They shut it down twice a day for five minutes to clean the filters. Once at noon, once at midnight. Noon is in one hour. JILLIAN How do you know all this? TEMPLAR Part of my job. Now ask the logical question... JILLIAN .. . where does it go? TEMPLAR Very good. Under the United States Embassy. There's an exit hatch into the embassy courtyard. That's where we're going. JILLIAN We...? Templar lowers his gun. He lowers the blade to her wrists and cuts the belt. TEMPLAR You heard me. A long pause. They stare at each other. JILLIAN Then what happens? TEMPLAR Let's get to the embassy, then we'll talk about it. JILLIAN Templar - about that night at my house TEMPLAR Don't talk about it, okay? He turns away from her. She watches him. JILLIAN Okay. CUT TO: EXT. MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - CONTINUOUS - DAY The Michael Romanov supporters are marching past the Kremlin with PLACARDS BEARING ROMANOV'S FACE, chanting: KARPOV MUST GO! Ahead, awaiting them, are -- Two units of MOSCOW POLICE in riot gear. A POLICE SERGEANT clicks on a megaphone. MOSCOW POLICE SERGEANT Disperse. Disperse! On come the Romanov supporters. Rocks start flying. The Romanov supporters push into the line of police. The police push back with shields and truncheons. A melee breaks out. The Romanov supporters surge past the police. It is a wild, uncontrolled, chaotic scene. EXT. MOSCOW - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - DAY ROMANOV SUPPORTERS flood past the embassy gates, chased by Moscow Policemen. Fights rage allover the street. A full-fledged riot is breaking out. OVERTURNED CARS are burning. LOOTERS run through the streets with stolen goods. We hear the sporadic CRACKLE of small arms fire. IN THE U. S. EMBASSY COURTYARD A U. S. MARINE and ARMY GREEN BERET detachment, grimfaced and heavily armed, stand silent vigil inside the embassy's wrought-iron gates. COLONEL WILLIAM CROSBY, embassy c.o., exits the embassy and approaches the front gates. A FULL BEER BOTTLE smashes at his feet, showering him. COLONEL CROSBY Jesus H. Christ. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE U. S. EMBASSY Ilya and his men stand next to their vehicles, silently watching the embassy. CUT TO: INT. MOSCOW SEWER SYSTEM - DAY The WHOOSHING water in the municipal water main begins to subside. Templar looks at this watch. INSERT - TEMPLAR'S WRISTWATCH - it is exactly 12 noon. TEMPLAR Right on time. The water subsides to a trickle. Templar grips the hatchwheel and turns it. Opens the hatch. Residual water spills out onto the walkway. Templar pulls himself into the water main. He extends his hand to Jillian. Jillian looks uncertainly inside. TEMPLAR Four blocks. Right under Tretiak's men and up into the embassy compound. You can do this. She grabs Templar's hand. He pulls her up and inside -- INT. MOSCOW - MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - DAY -- a four foot diamater pipe. Templar pulls out a PENLIGHT, switches it on and sticks it between his teeth. On hands and kneess Templar and Jillian move off through the water main. INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET Templar and Jillian crawl up. Templar shines his penlight at the ceiling; AN EXIT HATCH WITH HATCHWHEEL is above them. JILLIAN It doesn't seem like we've gone far enough. TEMPLAR We haven't, up there's the street in front of the embassy. (looks at his wristwatch) Come on. We've got two minutes. They crawl off through the water main. INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN UNDER EMBASSY Templar and Jillian crawl toward A SECOND EXIT HATCH. TEMPLAR There it is. They reach the exit hatch. They look at it. Jillian trembles. JILLIAN Oh my god... The EXIT HATCH has no hatchwheel. It's sealed. Jillian, panicked, looks down the water main. JILLIAN We. ...we've got to go back. TEMPLAR (checks his watch) Not enough time. (thinks) The hatch under the street. JILLIAN What about Tretiak's men  TEMPLAR Better than drowning. They scramble off. We hear WHOOSHING WATER coming down the pipe. JILLIAN The water's back on! Back they go, crawling as fast as they can. INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET Templar and Jillian reach the exit hatch under the street. Templar grips the hatchwheel as -- THE WATER ROARS through the pipe, hitting Jillian flush, blowing her backward; she desperately clings to Templar's shoulders as he spins the hatchwheel. The water rises mercilessly. There's a foot of air, then six inches, then just three, then none at all, and they're under water... TEMPLAR desperately turns the hatchwheel, spinning it one last time and WHOOOSH, the hatch door blows open  INT. MOSCOW - MANHOLE BELOW THE STREET - - and SMASHES against A ONE FOOT DIAMETER PIPE running along the wall of the service manhole, CRACKING a fissure in it. PRESSURIZED GAS blows out of the pipe. TEMPLAR pulls himself up. He reaches down and pulls Jillian up. Templar kicks the exit hatchdoor closed and spins the hatchwheel shut. JILLIAN looks at the GAS spewing from the cracked pipe. She sniffs the air. Templar looks at the pipe. A warning is printed in five languages: GAS - DANGEROUS. TEMPLAR City gas line. JILLIAN We can't stay here, we'll asphyxiate. Templar and Jillian clamber up the steel runged ladder to the manhole cover. Templar pushes up the manhole cover, popping his head out, looking around. HIS EYES widen with alarm --- A POLICE VAN is rolling straight for his head. He ducks and closes the manhole cover as the VAN RUMBLES over it. Templar listens. Above, the van has stopped. Templar pushes up the manhole cover. The VAN has stopped directly over the manhole. EXT. MOSCOW - STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY Templar slithers out. Pulls up Jillian. They're under the van now. The van's rear door opens; TEN MEN jump down to the pavement. We see their BLACK BOOTS; they are MOSCOW POLICE, arriving to arrest the looters. Templar and Jillian crawl toward the van's rear. Templar looks toward THE U.S. EMBASSY. It's 100 yards away, but looks like 100 miles. TEMPLAR Both of us will never make it. But one of us can. (draws his gun) Give me ten seconds, then break for the embassy and don't stop running until you're at the gates. It's a hundred yards, so move it. JILLIAN What are you going to... TEMPLAR That's my business. JILLIAN Wait... (he stops) .. .Simon. Don't do this. They'll kill you. A long, tense pause. TEMPLAR The world can do without Simon Templar. It can't do without you. (smiles grimly) See you around sometime. He takes a deep breath and logrolls out. ABOVE THE VAN - TEMPLAR gets to his feet in the street, gun drawn. He races from the van, heading in a direction away from the embassy. ACROSS THE STREET - ILYA double takes, seeing Templar sprinting from the van. ILYA Kill him! Ilya, Whitehead and Tretiak's men sprint down the street after Templar, firing as they run, leaving -- JILLIAN UNDER THE VAN with a clear path to the embassy. She counts it off: three. . . . four. . . . five . . . . . TEMPLAR dives behind an OVERTURNED CAR and comes up firing on Tretiak's men. IN THE U. S. EMBASSY'S FRONT COURTYARD Colonel Crosby watches the situation unfold. COLONEL CROSBY What the hell is going on. IN THE STREET - ILYA, WHITEHEAD and the other men close in on Templar, laying down a withering fusillade of fire. Templar returns fire from behind the car. UNDER THE VAN - JILLIAN JILLIAN . . . nine. . . . TEN. . . . Jillian logrolls out from under the van. She sprints for the embassy gates. BEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR sees Jillian running for the embassy. As he returns fire, he exhorts her under his breath. TEMPLAR Go. Faster.. . . ILYA, firing on Templar, sees Jillian. He spins, running in a new direction. He's going to get Jillian before she can reach the embassy. JILLIAN, sprinting, screams to the embassy marines. JILLIAN Open the gate! IN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - COLONEL CROSBY turns to his second in command, a Lieutenant JONES. COLONEL CROSBY Do it. Lieutenant Jones and a MARINE PRIVATE push open the embassy gates. COLONEL CROSBY watches Jillian helplessly. There's nothing he can do. Not until she reaches the embassy. On Jillian comes, legs pumping, feet pounding the pavement. ILYA is right behind her. She can feel his breath he's so close. Twenty yards. Fifteen yards. Ten... BEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR dodges bullets, corning thick and heavy now, and watches in terror as --- ILYA, with a desperate reach, collars Jillian. She shrugs off her jacket, leaving Ilya with the jacket but no Jillian. Jillian lunges through the embassy gates... ... and is instantly surrounded by U.S. Marines. Jillian looks up at Colonel Crosby, panting. JILLIAN I'm an American citizen. COLONEL CROSBY You have our full protection ma'am. (looks at Ilya) Back away from the gate. Ilya's black eyes stare at Colonel Crosby. He backs away from the gate. He turns and sees  AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR, out of bullets with his hands raised, surrounded by Tretiak's men behind the overturned automobile. Ilya, fuming, walks across the street to Templar. AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - ILYA walks up to Templar. With the calm efficiency of a hangman, Ilya puts his hand on Templar's shoulder and forces him down, down to his knees. He sticks his gun to Templar's head. He's going to execute Templar right there, behind the overturned car in the street. IN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - JILLIAN, watching, frantically turns to Colonel Crosby. JILLIAN Do something! COLONEL CROSBY That's Russian soil out there, ma'am. Jillian turns away, horrified, shielding her eyes. BY THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR AND ILYA TEMPLAR (Russian) Wait. A cigarette. It's customary. Ilya looks at Templar. Looks at his men. And Ilya laughs. Chuckling at first, then open-mouthed. All of TRETIAK'S MEN laugh in Templar's face. Ilya takes out a cigarette. Hands it to Templar. Lights it for him. TEMPLAR (Russian) Thank-you. And Ilya and Tretiak's men continue to laugh. They won't be for long... Because Templar is looking at A GRATE above the municipal lines below. And TRETIAK'S MEN are sniffing the air, wondering why it smells like rotten eggs... Templar flicks the cigarette into the grate and dives away as -- THE ENTIRE STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY blows sky high as THE GAS MAIN ignites . Ilya, Whitehead, and the other men are blown off their feet. Some are killed. Asphalt and dirt rain down, followed by -- WATER, as the municipal water main goes up. Ilya and Whitehead get to their feet, looking around, water falling like a monsoon. Templar is gone. And the police van is SPEEDING away. INT. POLICE VAN - DAY Templar guns the van through Moscow streets. He pulls out his cellular phone. Punches numbers. EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY Remy stands by his jet, smoking a cigar, looking impatiently at his watch. His cellular phone beeps. REMY Simon, where the hell are you... You want me to do what? Remy clicks off the phone and scrambles up into the cockpit of the Lear. INT. POLICE VAN - DAY Templar guns the van straight for -- A group of TRETIAK'S MEN conducting the building-to building search. They pull two sedans into the intersection, blocking it. INT. MOSCOW INTERSECTION - DAY Templar doesn't slow - he accelerates, and hits the two cars where their bumpers meet, BLASTING through them -- -- and races on past the intersection. INT. REMY' S LEAR JET - DAY Remy's Lear jet skirts Moscow rooftops, just 200 feet off the ground. As the jet clears the KREMLIN roof, we see majestic Red Square spreading before us... EXT. RED SQUARE - DAY TEMPLAR'S POLICE VAN roars into Red Square as -- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE - REMY'S LEAR JET touches down. In Red Square. It taxis to a stop next to Lenin's tomb. The police van SCREECHS up next to the Lear. Templar races from the van to the jet, dodging BULLETS fired from -- TRETIAK'S MEN, firing from sedans entering the square. The Lear jet accelerates straight for the oncoming sedans, lifting off, almost scraping the landing gear against their windshields. It wings into the air, clearing the top of the Ivan Memorial by a foot. And heads west. To freedom. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT - REESTABLISHING A shot of the city as we SUPER: St. Petersburg - two days later EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT The gates open. A BLACK SEDAN pulls into the drive and stops. Zubov gets out, then Dr. Singh, dressed in a conservative Indian suit, carrying a briefcase. Tretiak emerges from the mansion, greeting Doctor Singh. INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT Dr. Singh enters behind Tretiak and Zubov. They move to Zubov's lab table. Dr. Singh dons reading glasses. Zubov places Jillian's research before him. Singh flips a page, then another. He is awed. It's like Salieri looking at Mozart's sheet music. He's searched all his life for something and... another person has found it. DR. SINGH Yes. (beat) Yes. (beat) Yes, yes. . . . . (looks up) I will give you a list of the things I will need. I request solitude. Remove those men. (turns back to Jillian's document) Leave me now. Please. Tretiak and Zubov exchange a look. They exit. Dr. Singh rubs his brow, bearing down on the material, flipping through the pages which DISSOLVE INTO: PAGES being flipped, but these contain photographs... JILLIAN No. (beat) No. (beat) No. WIDEN TO -- INT. F. B. I. - MANHATTAN BUREAU - DAY JILLIAN sits with F.B.I. agents RABINEAU and LONNER. AGENT RABINEAU One more. Rabineau flips the page. SIMON TEMPLAR'S PHOTO stares at Jillian. She studies it a moment. Shakes her head. AGENT LONNER Be certain, Ms. St. Thomas. Look again. She looks again. Studies Templar's photograph. JILLIAN I'm certain. It's not him. Agents Rabineau and Lonner exchange a look. EXT. MANHATTAN - CENTRAL PARK - DAY Jillian walks down the tree-lined mall. Templar is standing there. She walks up to him. A moment. JILLIAN They showed me photographs of criminals. (beat) And a photograph of you. TEMPLAR And...? JILLIAN I said that the man in the photograph doesn't have the eyes of a criminal. (pause; they stare at each other) The Washington symposium is tomorrow afternoon. I'm going. I'm presenting my research to the scientific community. TEMPLAR What about your data... JILLIAN It's in my head. I'll wing it. TEMPLAR (draws closer to her) You need to conduct further research anyway. I'll help you. JILLIAN What are we researching. ..? Jillian draws closer. Their lips are almost touching... TEMPLAR The benefits of warm fusion. Templar pulls her lips to his and CUT TO... INT. JILLIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There follows a love scene. Afterward, in each other's arms: JILLIAN It is in the eyes. You're not bad. TEMPLAR Being bad is the only thing I've ever been good at. JILLIAN You can be good at being good. (she strokes his hair) If you're afraid of the dark, remember the night rainbow. If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast. If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind. And if between right and wrong, do what is right. TEMPLAR Who said that? JILLIAN (smiles privately) My grandmother. Templar gently takes her face in his hands. Whispers to her. TEMPLAR How did I meet you. This saint. (smiles) Saint Thomas. They kiss. DISSOLVE TO: INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT Late at night. Dr. Singh is working feverishly. The desk is stacked with papers and books. He is surrounded by three chalk boards with chemical isotope diagrams. He is adding chemicals to a bath of hydrogen in a COMPRESSION CHAMBER. DR. SINGH Zinc oxide. Iridium mercurate. Sodium bicarbon nitrate. A cobalt magnesium isotope. Liquify the cobalt at 665 degrees fahrenheit, add the magnesium. ... The chemicals begin to mix. He picks up an ELECTRODE NEEDLE attached to a LIGHTBULB. Dr. Singh takes a deep breath. He introduces the electrode needle into the compression chamber through a rubber valve. And like a miracle, the LIGHTBULB ILLUMINATES. Dr. Singh looks up as if he's just seen Shiva. DR. SINGH My god. It actually works. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - ESTABLISHING SHOTS - DAY The Capital on a cold, drizzly autumn day. A ROW OF FLASHBULBS EXPLODE POP POP POP... EXT.

AGENTS walk with her. It is raining. The place is a sea of umbrellas. Several REPORTERS trail after her. REPORTER 1 Doctor St. Thomas! Ben Rothstein, Omni Magazine. Is it true? Have you done it? JILLIAN That question will be answered in ten minutes, Mr. Rothstein. REPORTER 2 Marilyn Jones, Doctor St. Thomas. Dr. Vijay Singh has said that your theories are insupportable... JILLIAN (smiles) Sorry, but I'm not interested in Doctor Singh's opinions on this or anything else. JILLIAN moves up the steps, radiant and beautiful; it is the pinnacle of her life. She looks across the Mall. TEMPLAR stands there. Alone, smiling at her. Jillian winks at him, mouthing the words: "open it." TEMPLAR understands. He pulls a GIFTWRAPPED BOX from his pocket and opens it. Inside is a TIE-PIN; a stick figure man with a halo over his head. Templar sticks it through his tie. Picks up the accompanying card. INSERT - THE CARD reads: Anyone can be a saint, Simon Templar. Templar looks back at Jillian. He sees something. Behind Jillian, moving toward her through the crowd, is a BLONDE MAN UNDER AN UMBRELLA. It looks like... Ilya. Templar squints for clearer vision. He begins walking toward the Smithsonian. He quickens to a jog, now he's running... ON THE SMITHSONIAN STEPS - THE REPORTERS crush into Jillian. REPORTERS Ms. St. Thomas, Ms. St. Thomas... JILLIAN Please, no more questions. ... Across the sea of people, TEMPLAR reaches the Blonde Man. Templar grabs his arm; whips him around. BLONDE REPORTER Hey! What's the idea? It's not Ilya, just a reporter with blonde hair. Meanwhile JILLIAN, backing up the stairs from the reporters, draws closer to - - A DARK-HAIRED MAN, seen from behind, who lowers an umbrella, pushing a button on the handle, revealing a GLISTENING NEEDLE POINT. CAMERA moves over his shoulder, revealing...ILYA. With dyed black hair. JILLIAN keeps backing up the stairs... ...Behind her, Ilya's needled umbrella strikes her. JILLIAN feels something. Like a bee sting. Her hand moves to her hip... .. .as ILYA moves off through the crowd... ...TEMPLAR comes through the crowd to Jillian. The F.B.I. AGENTS grab him. JILLIAN Stop it! I know him! The Agents release Templar. Jillian looks at him. Templar's panting, out of breath. JILLIAN Simon? What is it? TEMPLAR Are you all right? JILLIAN Yes. (smiles) Go get a seat. Jillian moves up the stairs into the Smithsonian. ACROSS THE MALL.. .ILYA is gone, melting into the sea of umbrellas. INT. SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE - MAIN HALL - DAY The room is packed with scientists and reporters. Jillian mounts a podium in front of the room. JILLIAN Good afternoon. In 1989, two physicists claimed to have perfected... (her eyelids flutter) .. .cold nuclear fusion. Their results couldn't be duplicated. ... Jillian is perspiring. She has cotton mouth.

A CORONER CORONER Death occurred at two-fifty one p.m.  THE INQUEST JUDGE JUDGE It is the ruling of this court that death was due to natural... A REPORTER REPORTER .. ..and foul play was ruled out. In international news, the situation in St. Petersburg worsened... CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - DVORTSOVAYA PLOSHCHAD - DAY The square is filled with thousands of MICHAEL ROMANOV SUPPORTERS. They're camped out now. A C.N.N. NEWS TEAM transmits from the square. WOLF BLITZER The scene is reminiscent of the Tiananmen Square crisis, Bernard. The death toll stands at forty-eight civilians and at least twenty-one armed forces personnel. Rumors escalated today that... EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - ADMIRALTY - ESTABLISHING A LIMOUSINE pulls through a 'crowd of ROMANOV SUPPORTERS outside the heavily guarded gates of the Admiralty, Russia's Naval headquarters, akin to Annapolis. WOLF BLITZER .. . General Nicolai Radischev... (we see a photo of Radischev) ...has promised Michael Romanov his support, pending the outcome of today's meeting between Romanov and President Karpov. ROMANOV, in the back of the limousine, waves to his supporters. They go wild, clapping and cheering. The limo continues into the Admiralty compound. EXT. ADMIRALTY - DAY The limousine rolls through a guarded checkpoint, stopping before -- THE ADMIRALTY'S NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY: in a more dangerous time, this is the place from which Russian military leaders would conduct nuclear war. It's an acre-sized field of concrete, recessed 30 feet into the earth. It looks like a very large, very deep swimming pool emptied of water. In the middle is a concave-shaped entrance hatch (visualize an enormous bowl turned upside down). The two halves of the concave hatch open down the middle, each side retracting into the facility. On the concrete floor next to the hatch is a SMALL DETECTION UNIT. We'll find about the unit shortly... Romanov and four bodyguards exit the limousine. Two RUSSIAN SECRET SERVICEMEN escort Romanov to the entrance hatch. They descend down stairs to -- INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS - DAY - - a large room dominated by an ELECTRONIC MAP OF THE WORLD. Rows of computer stations run the length of the room. It looks like a N.A.S.A. control room. The Secret Servicemen lead Romanov across the room to -- INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE - DAY An office, relatively comfortable, with a computer, a television and v.c.r., and a small satellite link. VICTOR KARPOV, the popularly elected President of Russia, rises. Karpov is 55, intelligent, with a calm, professional demeanor. ROMANOV A nuclear bunker, Mr. President? You must worry for your safety. KARPOV I have reason to. ROMANOV Yes. You do. They glare at each other. KARPOV You understand my policy on taping meetings. Romanov consents with a wave of his hand. Karpov motions to his ATTACHE, who flips the switch on a VIDEO CAMERA mounted in the wall. KARPOV I'll get to the point. Your remarks are irresponsible; they've caused civil unrest. Unless you appeal to your supporters to stop rioting, I will institute martial law. (beat) Tell me what you want. ROMANOV A public debate, then new elections. We'll let the people decide. KARPOV (considers this) Agreed. They shake hands. Romanov rises and exits. CUT TO: A HAND reaching for a SHOTGLASS. The hand shakes so badly.. .it has to set the glass down. WIDEN TO -- INT. MANHATTAN - LOWER EAST SIDE BAR - DAY -- TEMPLAR, drunk at noon in a wretched little dive on Avenue A. His face is drawn and pale. Haunted. Hasn't slept or shaved for days. His fingernails are dirty. TWO DARK-SUITED MEN enter. One pauses by the entrance, the other goes to the bar. He sets a FOLDER on the bartop and slides it to Templar. The two men exit. Templar opens the folder. Inside is a plane ticket. A plane ticket to St. Petersburg... DISSOLVE TO: INT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE - DAY Tretiak sits behind his desk. The room is dark. TRETIAK The woman's death was unfortunate. You lost. I lost. To think what we could have done with her formula. But life goes on, no? TEMPLAR sits opposite Tretiak, staring at him. He is shaved and rested, his eyes utterly alert. TRETIAK When Romanov gains the presidency Russia will be ours. The possibilities are, you would agree, endless. (beat) You have talent. Unique talent. I need that talent to break into an impregnable facility. Be part of this, Templar. TEMPLAR (considers this) Fifteen million, plus the fifteen you owe me. TRETIAK I owe you nothing. You were hired to steal something and you failed. TEMPLAR Thirty million, and I use my own men. TRETIAK Twenty million, and one of my men goes with you. Templar nods in agreement. Rises. Goes to the door. TRETIAK Templar. A question. (Templar turns) You had feelings for the woman, didn't you? TEMPLAR I don't have feelings, Tretiak. Templar, his face hard, cold, expressionless, exits. Tretiak watches him. CUT TO: INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - OFFICE - DAY A hotel in the heart of the city. We hear sounds of demonstrations and rioting in the street below. Templar sits at a table with Harry Winston, Remy Samarkand, and Frankie. ARCHITECTURAL PLANS and PHOTOGRAPHS of the Admiralty's Nuclear Situation Facility are spread amongst room service trays. ILYA, and the massive ZERO sit on the couch, listening. Ilya eyes Templar. Templar periodically meets Ilya's eyes. These exchanged glances are rife with hostility. They've been at this a while and everyone's frustrated. FRANKIE No, no, no, Karpov's office is in the nuclear operations room. The entry hatch can't be activated from above - only below. REMY It's lead-lined and reinforced with eight feet of concrete. Explosives and drills are out. TEMPLAR Electronic by-pass? FRANKIE Negative. Understand something, Simon, please: this is not a bank. This is the former Soviet Union's missile command. Forced entry is impossible. A long pause. Everyone looks at each other. Templar examines A PHOTOGRAPH of the facility. He fixates on it. He sees something. TEMPLAR What's that? Templar points at the SMALL DETECTION UNIT next to the Nuclear Operations entrance hatch. Frankie looks at the photograph, then picks up a set of blueprints. Starts flipping through... FRANKIE Uhhm.. .that is the facility's... (comes to the relevant page and reads:) ... radiation detector. In the event of nuclear fall-out it automatically closes the hatch. Everyone turns to Templar. TEMPLAR You're saying the system can think. FRANKIE Yes. TEMPLAR Then it can be lied to. CUT TO: INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV'S LAB - DAY Romanov and Tretiak stand on one side of the lab. ACROSS THE LAB, ZUBOV and DR. SINGH are huddled over a hydrogen tank, just like the one we saw in Jillian's lab. The tank is surrounded by hundreds of testtubes and beakers containing chemicals. TRETIAK The world will continue to spend half its gross national product on oil. ROMANOV And Russia will spend none. Within five years we will be the wealthiest nation on earth. TRETIAK And it's leaders, Romanov, the most powerful people. CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - ADMIRALTY - NIGHT The situation in the city has worsened. The ROMANOV SUPPORTERS outside the admiralty now number several thousand. They carry pro-Romanov banners and shout: DOWN WITH KARPOV! In the b.g., we see more rioting. Gunfire crackling. An overturned truck. A MILITARY AMBULANCE careens around the corner and rolls past the Romanov supporters up to the Admiralty gates. TWO RUSSIAN NAVY M.P.'s open the gates. The ambulance pulls inside. The driver's window rolls down. It's Harry Winston dressed as a RUSSIAN ARMY PARAMEDIC. HARRY WINSTON (Russian) Two soldiers shot by looters! The M.P. waves the ambulance through. Harry waves back. The ambulance pulls into the Admiralty compound, going past to the rear, to the NAVAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD. EXT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL The ambulance pulls up next to the emergency ward. The back door opens. Remy, dressed as a PARAMEDIC, gets out. Remy and Harry haul out two heavily bandaged RUSSIAN SOLDIERS on stretchers. The stretchers expand into rolling gurneys. Harry and Remy roll the wounded soldiers inside. INT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL Harry and Remy roll the gurneys through the emergency ward. NAVAL DOCTORS and NURSES are scrambling around, attending to WOUNDED SOLDIERS. The scene is frenetic. The gurneys roll past the operating rooms, through double doors, into a room. No one notices. INT. ADMIRALTY - HOSPITAL STORAGE ROOM A room stocked with hospital supplies. The wounded "soldiers" spring off the gurneys. They are TEMPLAR and ILYA. Ilya wears the uniform of a NAVAL M.P. Templar wears a bulky, lead-lined anti-radiation suit. Templar shoulders his backpack. Harry Winston stands on a counter, pushing up the CEILING TILE. Templar and Ilya climb atop the counter. Harry forms a stirrup with his hands and hoists Templar, then Ilya, through the hole in the ceiling. INT. ADMIRALTY - VENTILATION DUCTS - NIGHT Templar and Ilya crawl through the ventilation duct to a WIRE MESH OPENING. Templar rips off the wire mesh screen. Thirty feet below, in the recessed entrance to the nuclear situation facility, TWO NAVAL GUARDS are walking their shift. They walk around the corner. . . TEMPLAR We've got sixty seconds. Move. EXT. ADMIRALTY - SIDE OF BUILDING Templar crawls out of the ventilation duct, his feet finding a windowsill. Just three inches to stand on. Ilya crawls out, his feet finding the same windowsill. The two men are side-by-side. They begin inching across the sill to a STEEL-RUNGED ladder leading to the concrete floor below. Ilya's FOOT suddenly slips. His arms flail. He tries to keep his balance, but fails. Templar catches Ilya's wrist. A terrifying tableau: Ilya, hanging over the concrete floor below, held up only by Templar. If Templar let's go, Ilya's dead. They stare at each other... And Templar pulls Ilya back. Ilya gets his footing. Catches his breath. Nods to Templar. They continue to the ladder and descend. EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS The naval guards walk their shift. EXT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY - NIGHT Templar and Ilya hurry across the concrete floor to the entrance hatch. Templar kneels next to the RADIATION DETECTOR, unshouldering his backpack. Templar's anti-radiation suit has a goggled hood, which he dons. He then carefully lifts from his backpack a PLEXIGLASS RECTANGULAR BOX the size and shape of a shoe box, and a high-powered cordless BOLTDRIVER. The plexiglass box has two' compartments, one empty, the other filled with SMOKY GAS. Templar positions the plexiglass box over the radiation detector. He unpockets FOUR CONCRETE BOLTS CREWS and bolts the box tightly to the concrete floor with the cordless boltdriver. (The plexiglass box has a steel mount with holes for this purpose.) EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS The naval guards reach the end of the perimeter wall, then turn back toward the nuclear situation facility... EXT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY - NIGHT Templar turns a knob on the plexiglass box; THE DOOR separating the two compartments within the box OPENS. Inside, THE SMOKY GAS releases. It wafts into the radiation detector's sensors.. ..Templar watches anxiously, talking to it... TEMPLAR Radon isn't plutonium but you don't know that... The detector's EMERGENCY LIGHT begins BLINKING. TEMPLAR Boom, you just got nuked. (unbolts the box) Now it's two months later and the radiation's gone... Templar rips the plexiglass box away from the detector, releasing the RADON GAS into the air. A moment passes. The EMERGENCY LIGHT turns off and, open sesame, THE CONCRETE HATCHDOORS separate, revealing STAIRS. Templar rips off his hood. He and Ilya descend. EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS The naval guards are nearing the rear of the Admiralty. Around the corner is the nuclear situation facility... INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION ROOM - DAY Templar and Ilya race down. At the base of the stairs is the HATCHDOOR open/close switch. Templar throws the "close" switch. Above, the hatch doors start to close.. EXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS The naval guards come around the corner just as... ... THE CONCRETE HATCH DOORS pull shut. INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION ROOM - DAY Templar and Ilya move through the nuclear situation room to President Karpov's office. INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE - DAY Ilya and Templar enter. Ilya opens the credenza behind Karpov's desk, revealing ROWS OF VIDEOTAPE CASSETTES. Ilya rifles through the tapes. Templar kneels behind the T.V. and V.C.R. He switches the T.V.'s satellite link from "RECEIVE" to "TRANSMIT," and adjusts the satellite frequency. Ilya hands Templar a VIDEO CASSETTE TAPE. Templar throws it in the V.C.R. and hits a button. The V.C.R. transmits the tape over the satellite link to the - - EXT. ADMIRALTY ROOF -- Satellite DISH on the Admiralty's roof, which sends the transmission into outer space, where it bounces off a satellite and returns to -- INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT -- a V.C.R. in the hotel suite, where Frankie hovers over an array of sophisticated editing equipment. Tretiak, Romanov, and several of Tretiak's men stand to the side. Templar's transmission plays on a T.V. It's a tape of the Karpov/Romanov meeting: KARPOV Tell me what you want. ROMANOV A public debate, then new elections. We'll let the people decide. KARPOV (considers this) Agreed. Frankie hits "play" on A SECOND V.C.R.: Here, we see the Tretiak/Ivan Grachameeting, taped earlier: TRETIAK Upon what conditions would you accept a partnership? Be reasonable. GRACHA Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. Both V.C.R.'s are connected to a VIDEO MORPHING SYSTEM not unlike those used by filmmakers. Frankie hits some buttons on the morphing machine. On the first V.C.R. MONITOR - ROMANOV'S IMAGE is lifted from the videotape. It simply disappears. CUT TO: INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATIONS FACILITY - NIGHT Templar and Ilya, waiting. Templar looks at his watch. TEMPLAR Come on, Frankie... INT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT Frankie, finished, hits "play." We see an altered version of the Karpov/Romanov meeting. Romanov has been morphed out and Ivan Gracha bas been morphed in. ON THE SCREEN, it now looks like this: PRESIDENT KARPOV Tell me what you want. GRACHA Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. PRESIDENT KARPOV Agreed. President Karpov shakes Gracha's hand. BACK TO SCENE Frankie turns to Tretiak and Romanov. FRANKIE Should I send it? TRETIAK Not yet. Romanov clicks on his cellular phone. ROMANOV General Radischev please. Yes, an emergency. Frankie, alarmed, turns to Tretiak. FRANKIE What's he doing? Templar won't have time to get out of there... Tretiak nods to ZERO who opens the door into the hall. TWO MOSCOW POLICEMEN enter. They stride over to Frankie, yank her up and handcuff her, dragging her off. CUT TO: EXT. ADMIRALTY - GARRISON - NIGHT The Naval Guard in the garrison looks up with wide, startled eyes at -- THREE RUSSIAN TANKS rumble up to the Admiralty, followed by a detachment of RUSSIAN ARMY SPECIAL FORCES. NAVAL GUARD (under his breath) Mother of God... The tanks smash through the gate, rolling into the Admiralty compound. The Special Forces Men walk silently past the startled Naval Guard, who rushes inside and hits a KLAXON HORN. INT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT Harry and Remy, startled by the klaxon, look out the storage room window at...the tanks. HARRY Come on, Simon, move it... EXT. ADMIRALTY - COMPOUND - NIGHT THE TANKS roll into the Admiralty compound: a message blares from one of the tank's loudspeaker: TANK LOUDSPEAKER (v. o .) This is a matter of national security. I repeat, this is matter of national... The tanks roll up to the nuclear situation facility. The Special Forces Men walk up to the open hatch. INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE Templar looks at his watch. He's waiting for Frankie to send back the morphed tape... TEMPLAR Come on, Frankie. Suddenly the transmission starts coming across the satellite link, recording over the old tape. It's almost finished... INT. ADMIRALTY - OPERATIONS ROOM - NIGHT The Special Forces Men come down the stairs and across the room toward Karpov's office... INT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR BUNKER - KARPOV'S OFFICE Templar yanks the MORPHED TAPE from the v.c.r and goes back to Karpov's credenza. He kneels by the drawer. Something fast and unexpected happens, like slight-of hand. Templar pulls A SECOND TAPE from inside his suit and puts it back in the drawer, sliding the morphed tape under the credenza. He stands, turns, and freezes... ILYA (remember, he is dressed as a NAVAL M.P.) has his gun leveled on Templar. Ilya steps past Templar. Lifts the tape from the drawer - the tape from Templar's waistband. The door bursts open. The Special Forces men pile inside. The Special Forces MAJOR regards the situation. ILYA I found him over there. (holds up the tape) With this. SPECIAL FORCES MAJOR Give it to me. (turns to his men) Arrest President Karpov. Four Special Forces Men race out. INT. ADMIRALTY - NIGHT President Karpov and his wife are sleeping. The door blasts open, throwing a beam of light on Karpov, who sits up, staring with a confused expression at -- The SPECIAL FORCES MEN, glaring back at him. CUT TO: EXT. DVORTSOVAYA PLOSCHAD - EARLY MORNING It's 4 a.m., but revolution is in the air. Thousands of St. Petersburgers are pouring into the square. It is an anxious, surreal scene. RUSSIAN TANKS and ARMOURED VEHICLES surround the square. THE CROWD explodes with thunderous cheers as -- MICHAEL ROMANOV, escorted by soldiers, comes through the crowd. GENERAL NICOLAI RADISCHEV, tall, stern, career Army man, follows with a contingent of junior officers. Behind Radischev are TEMPLAR, FRANKIE and PRESIDENT KARPOV, under arrest, escorted by SPECIAL FORCES MEN. Romanov climbs atop a TANK TURRET. He looks out over the crowd. THE CROWD comes to a hush. Like Lenin's arrival at Finland Station. A history-in-the-making atmosphere. ROMANOV Friends, countrymen, I give you Major Antonin Scarpinin. Major Scarpinin (the Special Forces Major), climbs atop the tank turret. MAJOR SCARPININ Twenty minutes ago a team of Russian Special Forces, acting on confidential information, raided President Karpov's office... ACROSS THE SQUARE - TRETIAK and his men emerge from several limousines. As Tretiak moves through the crowd, IVAN GRACHA and twenty of his men approach. TRETIAK Thank you for coming, Ivan, it is a great night for Russia. IVAN GRACHA I don't give a damn who's president. I'll make my money either way. TRETIAK Maybe you should take greater interest in politics, Ivan Gracha. Tretiak and Gracha turn to Major Scarpinin, listening... ON THE TANK TURRET - TEMPLAR and FRANKIE are shoved by soldiers up next to Scarpinin. Templar and Frankie exchange a steely glance. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE - REMY and HARRY come through the crowd. Seeing Templar and Frankie atop the tank, they stop in their tracks and watch... MAJOR SCARPININ This man, a known international thief, aided by this woman, a German operative, were arrested stealing a surveillance videotape from President Karpov's office. Scarpinin shows THE SEIZED TAPE to the crowd, then hands it to Romanov, who climbs atop the tank. TEMPLAR AND FRANKIE are pulled down from the turret and led away to TWO ARMY TRUCKS in the background. ROMANOV One month ago I said I would prove that those who call themselves our leaders... (points at KARPOV) .. .are in league with those who we know to be thieves, traitors, rapists of our once-great country. Do you want to see this proof? THE CROWD (out for blood) YES! Romanov hands the tape to Major Scarpinnin, who walks it over to an army communications TECHNICIAN standing by a portable V.C.R. linked to the HUGE SCREEN (seen in Romanov's earlier speech) above Romanov. ON THE TANK TURRET - ROMANOV points at the HUGE SCREEN. The crowd waits breathlessly. .:. ON THE SCREEN - the tape begins playing, but we don't see Karpov's office. Shockingly, we see...Tretiak's. Simon Templar stashed the tape Frankie recorded of the Tretiak/Romanov meeting in Karpov's office. We see: TRETIAK Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the Fatherland. How will that sound to the average Russian? ROMANOV The average Russian is a fool. IN THE CROWD there is confusion, incredulity. ROMANOV'S eyes widen. TRETIAK and MEN stare in disbelief at the screen. IVAN GRACHA and his men slowly back away from Tretiak. ROMANOV He exists to be dominated. To partnership in government. TRETIAK No Romanov  to partnership in crime. MICHAEL ROMANOV looks down at the crowd and... . ...500,000 RUSSIANS stare back at him in silence. ROMANOV That.. . that it is a fraud... (turns to General Radischev) I can explain. RADISCHEV (motions to MAJOR SCARPININ) Arrest him. Scarpinin and his Special Forces Men close in on Michael Romanov, the crusading reformer. ACROSS THE SQUARE - TRETIAK AND HIS MEN, huddled in a protective circle, stare into the angry faces of half a million Russian citizens. Total silence. A pin could drop. Tretiak and his men brandish their weapons. The intimidated crowd backs off. They move quickly toward their vehicles, the CROWD parting for them. A DETACHMENT OF RUSSIAN MARINES comes through the crowd. They are heavily armed and ready for business. Tretiak aims and fires. A MARINE goes down. CIVILIANS SCREAM and dive away. pandemonium breaks out. TRETIAK'S MEN open fire. The MARINES return fire. A harrowing amount of ammunition is expended in seconds. Ten of Tretiak's men and many marines take hits. ZERO dies instantly. A brutal, close-quarters firefight. The outnumbered marines take the worst of it. Tretiak, Ilya, and Tretiak's surviving men run past the fallen marines to their vehicles. They pile into the first two cars and SQUEAL away, heading down the Nevsky Prospect. ACROSS THE SQUARE - AT THE ARMY TRUCKS Panic and pandemonium. Soldiers running here and there amidst panicked civilians. A SPECIAL FORCES SERGEANT stands guard outside one of the trucks. A NAVAL PARAMEDIC, supporting a WOUNDED PARAMEDIC, staggers up. Harry Winston and Remy, of course. HARRY WINSTON (Russian) Sergeant, give me a hand. The Sergeant gives Harry a hand. REMY stands up; whips the barrel of his gun across the Sergeant's head, who collapses onto Harry. Harry drags him off and  REMY pulls the pin on the truck's doorlock. The door swings open. Templar hops down  TEMPLAR Get Frankie. Remy and Harry hurry off to the other army truck. TEMPLAR gets in the truck, sliding behind the wheel. He starts the ignition and throws it in drive. The truck rumbles forward, hopping the curb. THE ARMY TRUCK ROARS out of the square, pursuing Tretiak's vehicles down the Nevsky Prospect as, behind him -- - - the TANKS and ARMOURED VEHICLES also roar out of the square, followed by Russian Marines, Special Forces, and the enraged crowd. They too head down the Nevsky Prospect for the mafia headquarters... CUT TO: EXT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Tretiak's vehicles wheel into the circular drive. No guards are present. Tretiak and men exit the vehicles and race inside -- INT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Tretiak and his men hurry in. No guards here, either. Tretiak's on his cellular phone. TRETIAK Get the plane running, we'll be there in five minutes. (to his men) Clean out the safe. Burn the records in my office. Tretiak and Ilya go quickly to the basement stairs. Tretiak's men go for the upstairs staircase. INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV' S LAB A T.V. shows a newscast from the Ploschad. Dr. Singh and Zubov, having seen everything that just transpired, are frantically destroying their data and records. Zubov is burning the cold fusion hardcopies in a waste basket. Dr. Singh is deleting the computer files. Tretiak and Ilya come down the stairs. Zubov pops a 3 1/4 disk from the computer. ZUBOV We reduced the fusion formula to one disk and destroyed everything else. TRETIAK Good. And Tretiak draws his gun. As does Ilya. Zubov and Dr. Singh stare at the guns. DR. SINGH What.. . what are you...? Tretiak shoots Zubov. Ilya shoots Dr. Singh. The two scientists fall, dead. So much for honor among thieves. Then Tretiak wheels on Ilya, his gun coming up. Yes, so much for honor among thieves... Tretiak freezes, startled. Because Ilya has his gun leveled on Tretiak. Tretiak tries to speak. Words won't form. Ilya FIRES. Tretiak pitches over backward. Ilya walks past Tretiak's corpse, yanks the computer disk from Zubov's lifeless hand and turns -- TEMPLAR stands across the lab, gun in hand. Ilya's eyes dart around the room. ILYA We can share this, Templar. TEMPLAR We don't own it. ILYA Who does? TEMPLAR (eyes glinting) The Jillian St. Thomas Foundation. There is a sudden shrill WHISTLING SOUND. Templar and Ilya look around. ILYA Don't be a fool. TEMPLAR I'm a fool? You thought you could get away with murder. Used curare didn't you? Induces blood-clotting. Templar clicks back the hammer... ILYA What do you want? The WHISTLING is louder. Anyone with military service knows the sound of incoming ordnance... TEMPLAR What do I want? I want.. . revenge. Now give me the disk. There's a massive EXPLOSION above. The laboratory is ROCKED. A SHELF OF CHEMICALS teeters over, falling on TEMPLAR, knocking the gun from his hand. The beakers of chemicals SMASH all around Templar Ilya sprints for the stairs. Templar grabs for his gun, lying in a puddle of CARBOLIC ACID. He grabs the gun; the acid burns his flesh. He drops it and races for the stairs. INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT Ilya emerges from the basement stairwell and races for the front door. Templar comes up; sprints after Ilya. Ilya, with Templar hotly behind, gets to the front door, flings it open, and... freezes. And Ilya and Templar are suddenly staring down the barrel of -- A RUSSIAN TANK. Just sitting there in the mansion courtyard. Russian soldiers behind it. Ilya and Templar duck. The tank FIRES. The MISSILE PROJECTILE explodes from the tank's barrel, flies through the mansion's front door over Ilya and Templar's heads... ... wings across the interior of the mansion... .. . and SLAMS into the rear wall of the mansion, exploding, blowing the wall down, revealing ANOTHER TANK at the mansion's rear, lumbering toward it. Ilya slams the door shut and whirls on Templar. They trade blows. Ilya has the better of this. He shoves Templar aside and races back through the foyer. Templar recovers and races after Ilya, tackling him in the middle of the floor. They roll on the floor, trading vicious blow after vicious blow, when --- -- A TANK SHELL RIPS into the mansion's domed cupola. Templar and Ilya look up in horror as -- THE 20 FOOT DIAMETER CRYSTAL CHANDELIER descends. Templar and Ilya dive away. The chandelier CRASHES spectacularly in the middle of the foyer, exploding like a glass grenade. A HUGE PIECE OF CRYSTAL hits Templar in the side of the head, opening a gash, dazing him. There's no place to go. Except up. Ilya races for the staircase. Templar recovers and takes up the chase again. Up the staircase they go. A SECOND TANK MISSLE slams into the dome, imploding it. CHUNKS OF STONE and MASONRY fall on Ilya and Templar, knocking them both backward. INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT The lab is rocked by the explosions. RACKS OF CHEMICALS in beakers fall to the floor, SMASHING. The chemicals begin to ooze together. A chemical reaction is occurring. The mixing chemicals begin emitting smoke. INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - CORRIDOR/TRETIAK'S OFFICE Tretiak's men are at the windows with automatic weapons, firing on the army below. Two men drag a crate into the office. They open it, revealing an  ANTI-TANK GRENADE LAUNCHER. They pull it from the crate and set up the tri-pod... ON THE STAIRCASE - TEMPLAR AND ILYA continue up the staircase. Ilya reaches the mezzanine. He climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater in the dome. He pulls himself up. Templar repeats Ilya's actions: climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater. As he pulls himself up... ILYA appears. He compresses his foot against Templar's knuckles. Templar grimaces. There's no way out this time. There's a burst of ORANGE LIGHT as A TANK SHELL explodes on the roof, knocking Ilya off his feet, allowing -- -- Templar to pull himself up to the roof. EXT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS / NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT The tanks continue firing. Russian Marines fire round after round into the mansion. Tretiak's men inside return the fire. Harry, Remy and Frankie run up, looking with alarm at the vicious firefight. Realizing Templar is within... INT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE The anti-tank grenade launcher is operational. One of Tretiak's men loads, the other fires, and -- EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT -- an ANTI-TANK SHELL launches from the window and hits the tank in the courtyard, blowing its turret off. Tretiak's men fire assault rifles from the windows. No one's surrendering. It's a fight to the death... EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ROOF - NIGHT Templar and Ilya, on the mansion's roof. The view is mind-boggling: the nighttime St. Petersburg skyline looming in the background and, below, three Russian tanks firing shell after shell into the mansion. Across the exploding, crumbling rooftop, Ilya and Templar go. A TANK SHELL explodes in front of Ilya. Ilya falls, concussed by the shell. Templar dives upon him, wrenching the COMPUTER DISK from Ilya's pocket. Ilya slams his forearm into Templar's head. The disk flies from Templar's hand, scuttles across the roof shingles, falling through a crater... ... it flutters to the mansion floor, 50 feet down. They get to their feet, circling each other. Their footing is not trustworthy, like ice in Spring. Tank shells SLAM into the mansion's upper architecture and roof. A shell hits the mansion's east wall, detaching the DRAIN PIPE running up it. Ilya draws a SWITCHBLADE. Backing Templar up. Templar's at the very edge of the building. There's no place to go. Templar's feet are unsteady. Because the cornice of the building is crumbling beneath him. ... And Templar falls. He looks over his shoulder, his wrists turning, hands opening, and... ... Templar catches the detached DRAINPIPE. The drainpipe sags under Templar's weight, bending... And it stops. Templar hangs there, bobbing up and down above the alley between the mansion and the adjacent building, fifty feet below. Ilya turns back. He's going after the disk. Ilya jumps through the crater to the mezzanine and races down the staircase...while in the basement... INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT Another whole shelf of chemicals falls, smashing. The chemicals continue to mix... EXT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ROOF Templar dangles from the drainpipe. KA-CHUNG. It gives. It gives again. The drainpipe is about to break. Templar looks down into the flames and demolition below... INT. TRETIAK's MANSION - STAIRCASE/FOYER - NIGHT Ilya races reaches the foyer. The building is imploding, chunks of stone falling all around him. Ilya's eyes are wild. He wants that disk... Ilya gets to it. Clutches it. It's finally in his hands. He goes for the staircase. ... INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT The chemicals are steaming now, in a froth, becoming more and more and more volatile... EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT Templar, dangling from the drainpipe, looks wildly around for an escape. If he could just get to that adjacent building... It's too far. And his hands are slipping... Then, from the mansion's basement, the very guts of the building, the chemicals in the lab detonate and -- THE MANSION EXPLODES FROM WITHIN. INT. TRETIAK' S MANS ION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT Ilya's eyes bulge in terror as the staircase collapses under him. Ilya falls, engulfed in flame, still clutching the cold fusion disk. EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT The drainpipe fully detaches from the collapsing mansion wall. It falls away from the mansion, with Templar still holding on... Templar releases from the drainpipe and catches the lip of the roof cornice of the adjacent building. Templar pulls himself up and looks back at... TRETIAK'S MANSION. The entire building comes apart at the seams. It crashes into a heap of rubble. FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT. MANHATTAN - REESTABLISHING - DAY The skyline of the great city as we SUPER: NEW YORK CITY - ONE MONTH LATER EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - ESTABLISHING It's mid-day. People coming and going. INT. ROCKEFELLER - AN OFFICE CAMERA PANS past the office door, stenciled -- ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION - CHARITABLE DONATIONS -- to a huge desk. Two middle-aged LADIES are going through a four-foot stack of MAILED DONATIONS. They are LUCY and DELORES. LUCY Here's one from that guy who owns most of Brooklyn. Ten bucks again. LUCY I'll alert the media. Guy's richer than god... DELORES (reads a check) Hey, Mr. Anderson at the Met gave a thousand this year. Lucy? But LUCY'S not listening. She's staring at a check. Her eyes are like hubcaps. LUCY Oh my goodness gracious... (looks at Delores) Get Mr. Thomas, Delores. DELORES What is it? LUCY A check for fifty... (gulps) ...million dollars. Delores gets up, goes to Lucy, who's hyperventilating. Lucy hands her the check. Delores starts hyperventilating. Lucy reads the letter: LUCY It's from a "Jillian St. Thomas Foundation," for the benefit of scientific research. DELORES Never heard of it. Lemme see. Lucy hands Delores the letter. INSERT - THE LETTER is printed under a letterhead with a logo design: the stick figure man with halo, the same design as the tiepin Jillian gave Templar. BACK TO SCENE Delores looks at Lucy. Lucy looks back. And over this we hear a voice. We've heard it before... JILLIAN ST. THOMAS If you're afraid of the dark, remember the night rainbow... EXT. MANHATTAN - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SUNSET A lone man stands on the bridge. The spires of Manhattan rise above him. The sun is setting... JILLIAN ST. THOMAS If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast. If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind... CAMERA closes in on the hard, defiant face of a man who has changed a great deal in these months. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS And if between right and wrong... And Simon Templar joins Jillian here, speaking with her soul... SIMON AND JILLIAN ...do what is right. And Simon whispers to himself... SIMON I will do what is right. PULLING BACK, we see that the sunset has cast rays through the bridgework. And we can't be certain, it is vague, but the rays filtering through the bridgework seem to cast a halo over Templar's head. He is, now, The Saint. THE END to be continued...

    FADE IN:

1   EXT. PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - DAY            1

    of an empty stretch of land parted down the middle by
    railroad tracks. An Amtrak Commuter crests the horizon,
    heads TOWARD us. As it gets CLOSER, we GO IN TIGHTER to
    see --


2   FACE OF SARA JOHNSON                                       2

    17, pressed at one of its windows.


3   REVERSE ANGLE - REFLECTION IN TRAIN'S WINDOW -             3
    SARA'S FACE

    distant and lovely and sad. SUPERIMPOSED against an
    endless stream of sky and trees. The train speeds up and
    SARA's face flies by, disappearing FROM FRAME.


4   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - MOVING - DUSK                          4

    A zaftig BLACK WOMAN clumsily negotiates the aisle.
    Stops at the first of a few empty seats left in the car.

                             WOMAN
               This seat taken?


    ANGLE ON SARA

    looking up, around. She shakes her head, clears her
    backpack and magazines from the seat beside her. The
    Woman drops down, settles in. A long silence. The Woman
    glances at the American Ballet magazine on Sara's lap.
    Tries to make conversation.

                             WOMAN
               I love ballet. Never had the body
               for it. Do you dance?

    Sara folds her arms, turns away mumbling under breath.

                            SARA
               Used to.

    Sara gazes out the window. The world outside begins to
    dissolve melting into images from another time, another
    place. Her eyes stare blankly OUT AT us, blinded by her
    memories.

                                                            2.

5   FLASHBACK - INT. AUDITORIUM - KINDERGARTEN RECITAL - DAY 5

    A stage full of five-year-olds in tights and tutus. A
    little girl performs center stage. She's remarkably
    poised, remarkably good. CAMERA PANS TO the audience. A
    woman in an Irish clover necklace springs to her feet
    clapping loudly. The little girl's eyes catch the glint
    of the necklace's gold. Mommy. She flashes a megawatt
    smile, ends the dance with an unscripted bow, as we...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


6   INT. BALLET CLASS - EVENING (FIVE YEARS LATER)                6

    Young Sara, lithe and earnest, dances. A budding beauty
    blessed with long limbs and natural grace, she makes it
    look easy. Gliding past the envious stares of
    classmates, she scans the hall for a glint of gold.
    Finds it in the back of the room where her mother, Glynn,
    stands watching her. Their eyes connect with mutual
    smiles and those smiles CARRY us TO:


7   INT. SARA'S EXETER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                  7

    A pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood
    floor. PAN UP and PULL BACK to reveal Sara at 17,
    dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and
    rolled up rugs. As Glynn looks on, Sara completes the
    routine with a pirouette. She spins out of it with a
    preoccupied frown on her face.

                            GLYNN
               What's the matter?   It was good.

                            SARA
                    (checks her
                     stance in mirror)
             Everybody there's going to be
             good, Mom. I have to be better.
                    (then, beginning
                     again)
             My knees still knock when I do my
             free form. Did you notice that?

                           GLYNN
             I noticed that it was fine.

                           SARA
                    (escalating
                     frustration)
             It's not supposed to be fine.
             It's supposed to be special.
                           (MORE)

                           SARA (CONT'D)
             And it just lays there, it doesn't
             do anything. I bet they notice
             that. That it doesn't do
             anything. That I don't do
             anything special enough to get in.

                                GLYNN
                 Sara.   You'll get in.

                               SARA
                 Don't lie because you love me.     My
                 free form sucks.

                               GLYNN
                        (giving up that
                         battle)
                 I've got something for you. Come
                 on. Sit. Mouth closed, eyes
                 shut. No pouting. No peeking.

    Sara flops down on the sofa beside her. Closes her eyes.
    Glynn removes the clover chain from her neck, fastens it
    around Sara's.

                               GLYNN
                 For luck tomorrow. Not that
                 you'll need it. You dance like an
                 angel.

    The necklace is Glynn's talisman. Sara knows what it
    means to her. She throws her arms around Glynn, holds
    onto her tightly.

                               SARA
                 I love the necklace but you're
                 still the best luck I'll ever
                 have.

    Glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up.        They cling to
    each other.


8   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN (MOVING) - ON SARA - DUSK (PRESENT)          8

    In the blink of her eyes, the memory fades. She pulls
    the window shade, shifts in her seat. Her fingers travel
    to the clover necklace at her throat. Linger. The Woman
    regards her.

                               WOMAN
                 Nice... the necklace.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Oh. It's a good luck charm.
                  Doesn't always work.

     The Woman's wearing a crucifix.     She indicates it.
     Smiles.

                                 WOMAN
                  Mine either.


9    FLASHBACK - INT./EXT. BUS/RURAL ROAD - MORNING                 9

     A sea of young white faces. A jock entertains the troops
     with two straws up his nose. Sara sits next to her best
     friend, LINDSAY, 17. Lindsay, chomping on a wad of gum,
     turns from the jock to Sara with a bubble in bloom,
     bursts it with her teeth.

                                LINDSAY
                  Wanna pray? You're leaving for
                  Philly after first period. I
                  won't see you. We should pray.

                                SARA
                         (stupefied)
                  Lindsay... no. Not here.

     Lindsay grabs Sara's hand and bows her head.      Sara,
     embarrassed, aligns her head with Lindsay's.      She's
     praying nobody sees them.

                                LINDSAY
                  'Awesome, Father, S.J. auditions
                  today. She's ready for them.
                  Please make them ready for her.
                  Even if she screws up. Thanks.
                  Amen.'
                         (sure shrug; another
                          bubble)
                  God's gotten me outta all kinds of
                  shit. He oughta be able to get
                  you into Juilliard.


10   EXT. EXETER SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - LATER THAT MORNING            10

     Sara exits with a bouquet of roses, takes the steps two
     and three at a time. Glynn's waiting in a flower van at
     the curb.

                                                             5.

11   INT./EXT. FLOWER VAN (DRIVING)/RESIDENTIAL STREETS           11

     Sara and Glynn. The back of the van is filled with
     flower arrangements. Glynn takes note of the roses in
     Sara's hand.

                             GLYNN
               Where'd you get those, traitor?

                             SARA
               Ellison -- Mr. Ellison. He
               actually told me to break a leg.

                             GLYNN
               Roses from the principal, even
               droopy, out-of-season yellow ones,
               is beyond cool, kiddo. You're
               definitely movin' up in the world.

     Sara looks through the windshield.   It's starting to
     drizzle.

                             SARA
               Know what would be great? If you
               didn't drop me off at the bus
               station. If we just kept going
               until we get to Philly.

                             GLYNN
               Ruin everyone's Valentine's Day
               and not have a shop when I get
               back. That's your definition of
               great? I can see the headline
               now: 'Starving Artist Kills Unfit
               Mother.'
                      (gently)
               Sweetheart, we talked about this.
               I'll get there as soon as I can.

     Sara looks at her and Glynn instantly feels guilty.

                             SARA
               Right. This is the hardest, most
               important day of my life and all
               you can do is get there as soon as
               you can. Thanks, Mom.


12   EXT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION (READING, PA) -                   12
     CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Glynn pulls the van into the parking lot. Smiles at
     Sara. Sara doesn't smile back. She's too angry. Too
     scared.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             6.

12   CONTINUED:                                                   12

                                SARA
                  So I guess I'll see you later.

                                GLYNN
                  I won't miss your audition, Sara.
                  I'll be there, okay? If I have to
                  swim the Susquehanna, I'll be
                  there.

                                 SARA
                  Swim?   You can't swim, Mom.

                             GLYNN
               I'll float then.

     A moment. They look at each other. Sara finally smiles.
     They embrace and she hops out the van. Glynn calls after
     her.

                             GLYNN
               Hey... Happy Valentine's Day.


13   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN (MOVING) - ON SARA - NIGHT (PRESENT)       13

     Feigning sleep. From the corner of her eye, she watches
     the Woman beside her flip through the American Ballet
     Magazine. We move back in time through their pages.


14   FLASHBACK - INT. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA - WAITING        14
     ROOM - DAY

     Sara, in costume, flips through a magazine. She taps her
     toes, checks her watch. A phalanx of parents and dancers
     are clustered around a sign posted on the door:
     JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE AUDITIONS. Sara stares at it.
     Re-checks her watch. An official with a clipboard walks
     toward her. Where's her mother?


15   INT. UNIV. OF PENNSYLVANIA - STAGE/AUDITORIUM -              15
     MOMENTS LATER

     Sara on stage. She looks past a row of Juilliard JUDGES
     into the audience. No glint of gold. MOZART'S "Elvira
     Madigan" (Andante) CUES UP. Sara begins her technical.
     She transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful
     performance. The Judges are mutely but clearly
     impressed. One of them looks directly at her.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          7.

15   CONTINUED:                                                  15

                                JUDGE
                  Is there anything you'd like to
                  share about your free form before
                  you begin? A motif... a theme?

     Sara's stomach drops to her feet. Her mother's not there
     and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme.
     Shit!

                                SARA
                  Well, it's um, pretty self-
                  explanatory. The theme.

     The Judges exchange a look. New MUSIC CUES UP. Some
     driving, CLASSICAL NUMBER.   Sara tries to elevate her
     body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her
     feet. She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium
     for Glynn. Searching for her port in the storm.
     Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's
     dancing. Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling,
     recovering, and finally finishing with those damned
     knocking knees. The Judges, eyes like stones,
     perfunctorily nod. Their equivalent of maybe next year.
     Sara chokes two words out...

                                SARA
                  Thank you.


16   INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE

     ... Rushes backstage. Fighting tears, she hurries past
     waiting dancers angrily unhooking the clover leaf chain
     from her neck.


17   INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY                                    17

     Sara in street clothes. Cramming her ballet gear into a
     duffle bag when the official (of the clipboard)
     approaches her. She touches Sara's shoulder gently.
     Says something we do not hear.


18   INT. OFFICE (UNIV. OF PA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION               18

     SHOOTING THROUGH office window. A state trooper in a
     rain slicker offers Sara a chair. She sits. The trooper
     talks. As he does, dread and disbelief spread over
     Sara's face. She shakes her head, attempts to stand.
     Her legs buckle beneath her. The trooper and the
     official catch her as she falls.

                                                          8.

20   TRAIN                                                      20

     CHUGS toward Baltimore's Penn Station, which is visible
     in the f.g.


21   EXT. PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE - INTERCUT - MORNING             21

     A torrential rain. A flower van -- Glynn's van -- caught
     in it. SHOOTING THROUGH the driver's side window, we can
     see Glynn's face, intense and determined, squinting
     through the downpour.


22   TRAIN'S WHEELS                                              22

     GRINDING.


23   VAN'S WHEELS                                                23

24   TRAIN                                                       24

     It's SQUEAL OF BRAKES as it maneuvers into the station.


25   VAN                                                         25

     The SQUEAL of its BRAKES as Glynn loses control and
     smashes into the back of the eighteen wheeler in front of
     her.


26   TRAIN                                                       26

     across space and time, the SOUND OF SQUEALING BRAKES
     commingle as the Amtrak Commuter pulls into Penn Station.


27   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT                                   27

     Sara. Holding her breath, clenching her fists. Waiting
     for the sound to stop, oblivious to the stare of the
     Woman beside her.

                                                            9.

28   EXT. PENN STATION (BALTIMORE) - PLATFORM - NIGHT            28

     ROY JOHNSON, 37, a handsome, laconic man of uncertain
     style, takes a last drag from his cigarette, drops and
     stomps it. Passengers disembark from the train. Roy
     searches their faces. They all look like strangers.


29   EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - SAME TIME                               29

     A conductor helps Sara to the platform. Steam from the
     train's engine is sucked into the fog. She walks through
     it. Sees him. They see each other. Roy weakly waves.
     Walks toward her. Sara watches his bow legs stiffly
     advance. She wants to run. Can't.

                                 ROY
                Hi.

                                 SARA
                Hi.

                              ROY
                Have a good ride?

     Sara self-consciously tucks her hair behind an ear.

                              SARA
                Slept through most of it.

     A beat.   Roy looks at her.

                              ROY
                Guess you got stuff.    Baggage.

                                 SARA
                Two suitcases.     One big one.

                              ROY
                Looks like they're unloading.
                -- You hungry? We can stop
                somewhere if you want.

                              SARA
                I'm kinda tired.

     Roy takes her backpack.     They walk.


30   INT./EXT. ROY'S PICKUP/STREET - SARA AND ROY - NIGHT        30

     A heavy silence. Roy starts to turn on the radio, stops
     himself. He lights a cigarette, cracks the window.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           10.

30   CONTINUED:                                                  30

                                ROY
                  I didn't like leavin' you so soon
                  after the funeral. I wouldn't
                  have if you hadn't asked me to go.
                  I mean, I could've hung around.
                  Helped you say good-bye. That's
                  what you were doin', wasn't it?

                                  SARA
                  Uh-huh.

     Roy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself.

                                ROY
                  That's what I figured you were
                  doin'.

     Sara peers out    the windshield. Baltimore City. The
     neighborhoods    are changing. The streets are getting
     progressively    gritty and dirty. It surprises her. It
     worries her.     Roy worries her.

                                ROY
                  Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I
                  mean, we both got hit by the same
                  bolt of lightning. You don't have
                  to pretend this is easy.
                         (off nothing)
                  Everything's upside down right now
                  but don't worry. We'll work this
                  bachelor-father thing out. Hell,
                  it ain't like we're movin' in with
                  strangers. We got a pretty good
                  idea about each other, right?

     Sara looks askance at him, her expression indicating
     otherwise. A moment. Roy's too new at this to hold up
     both ends of the conversation. The silence deepens. Roy
     switches on the radio.


31   EXT. BOND STREET (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                  31

     Roy's truck pulls up to a string of disrepaired rowhouses
     with pristine white marble steps. He and Sara each lug a
     suitcase from the truck. Her eyes wander up and down the
     street. They're on the fringes of a ghetto. A few
     people roost on their stoops, hang on the corners. All
     of them have black faces.

                                SARA
                  Thought you were moving to Fells
                  Point.

                                  ROY
                  Fell through.

                                                             11.

32   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  32

     The second floor of a two-story house has been turned
     into a one-bedroom studio. A partition separates the
     living area from the bedroom. Sara walks past a
     collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of
     herself. Aside from the saxophones and the pictures,
     there's hardly any furniture. Roy lights a cigarette.

                             ROY
               Not much of what you're used to.
               But the water's hot and the fridge
               is full. And I made room in the
               closets for you. Girl's gotta
               have closets, right? You even get
               your own bed. I'll crash on the
               couch.

                             SARA
               You bought a bed?

                             ROY
                      (slight bow)
               Pardon me. Your own futon.     Check
               it out. On the other side.

     Suitcase in hand, Sara walks around the partition. Her
     "room" is an old futon, an ancient set of drawers. She
     stands in the middle of nothing, wanting something to do.
     She removes framed photos of Glynn from her backpack,
     places them around the room.


33   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA - MINUTES LATER            33

     Sara walks in.   Doesn't see Roy.   Calls out.

                             SARA
               Do you have a phone?

     Roy emerges from the bathroom drying his hands, walks
     past her.

                             ROY
               Of course I have a phone.

                             SARA
               You didn't at the last place.    The
               last place I saw anyway.

                             ROY
               Things change. You've changed.
               You grew up on me. Overnight.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              12.

33   CONTINUED:                                                     33

                                SARA
                  Over the summer. You blew me off
                  for some gig on the road,
                  remember?
                         (before he can
                          respond)
                  Can I call Lindsay? Let her know
                  I got here alright.

                            ROY
              Are you alright, Sara?
                     (off the scowl
                      in her eyes)
              I just wanna know how you feel.

                               SARA
              I feel fine.     I feel like calling
              Lindsay.

     She's a wall. A brick wall. Roy's head aches from
     knocking into it. He goes to the couch. Drops down.
     Mutters at her.

                                ROY
                  Phone's in the kitchen.   Knock
                  yourself out.


34   INT. SARA'S ROOM/BATHROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT                    34

     Sara lying in bed... wide awake... her stiff upper lip
     quivering. She slips out of bed, creeps on tiptoes into
     the bathroom. Closes the door oh-so-quietly behind her.
     She flips on the light, crosses to the sink, turns on
     both faucets. As the water flows and the PIPES RATTLE,
     the brick wall shatters. Sara crumbles to the floor.
     Buries her head in her arms. Cries like a baby.


35   INT./EXT. ROY'S PICKUP (SOUTH BALTIMORE) -                     35
     NEXT MORNING

     Roy and Sara. Barreling through the south end, tongues
     stuck in gear. A Pop-Tart grows cold on Sara's lap.
     Then, finally.

                                SARA
                  I can take the school bus.
                  Tomorrow.

                               ROY
                  School bus? That's the other Oz,
                  Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the
                  city Metro. Or walk.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             13.

35   CONTINUED:                                                     35

                                SARA
                  Well, I know how to do both.

                                ROY
                  Not around here you don't. Not
                  until you get the hang of things.

     Sara looks out the window at a full-fledged ghetto. It's
     all to obvious, the hang of things. Roy glances over at
     her.

                                ROY
                  I called about your transcripts.
                  You're all set. Patterson's got a
                  pretty good Humanities program.
                  No ballet, but we can find a
                  studio someplace close for after
                  school --

                             SARA
               -- I don't think I'll have time.
               I have to study, I'll be busy.

     Roy can hear the lie behind her words.      The pain too. He
     lights a cigarette, cracks the window.      He wants to say
     the right thing.

                             ROY
               Good idea. Take a break. Not too
               long a break though. You're a
               dancer. You should dance. Stay
               on top of your art.

                             SARA
               Like you stay on top of yours?

                             ROY
               Maybe I ain't playin' no grand
               ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals,
               but I'm playing.

                             SARA
                      (unconvincingly)
               I didn't mean it like that.

                                ROY
                  S'alright. Hell, I wish I had
                  half the time I wasted gettin'
                  wasted. But those days are over.
                  You'll see. I got my life on
                  track.

                                                            14.

36   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH SCHOOL (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - MORNING       36

     Formidably large and surprisingly well-kept, Patterson
     serves the nearby, predominantly black O'Donnell Heights
     Projects. Kids malinger outside on the front steps and
     lawn.


37   FROM ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT                             37

     Roy's pickup pulls in. Roy CUTS the ENGINE. Sara looks
     at him. Or through him. She won't let his eyes connect.

                             SARA
               You don't have to go in with me.
               Since I'm all set. I mean, I have
               done this before. Gone to school.
               I'll be fine. I am fine. Really.

     Roy regards her with weary resignation.   Sara climbs out.
     He calls after her.

                             ROY
               -- Pick you up. Three-thirty.

                              SARA
                       (over a shoulder)
               Yeah.   Sure. Whatever.


38   EXT./INT. PATTERSON HIGH - MORNING                           38

     Sara moving TOWARD us PAST a floating mosaic of black
     faces. This is a near out-of-body experience for her.
     She walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff
     straight line to the school's entrance. It's clogged
     with students. Inside the doorway, two security guards
     flank a metal detector. When it's Sara's turn to pass
     through, one of the guards grabs her backpack and
     wordlessly begins searching it. He hands it back to her
     on the other side of the detector where Sara stands
     obtusely and mutely amazed.


39   INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - MORNING                       39

     THROUGH a window, Sara seated across from an
     ADMINISTRATOR. We PUSH IN.

                             ADMINISTRATOR
               ... It's no fun being uprooted in
               the middle of your senior year.
               We realize that and we'll do what
               we can to help with the
               transition.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                 15.

39   CONTINUED:                                                        39

     There's a KNOCK at door. MRS. GWYNN, the Guidance
     Counselor, steps in. The Administrator introduces her to
     Sara. Sara regards Mrs. Gwynn with polite petulance.

                                   MRS. GWYNN
                  Any questions?     Concerns?

                                   SARA
                  About school?     No.   Not really.

                                MRS. GWYNN
                  Not even about Baltimore?

                                SARA
                  I'm not gonna be here that long.
                  Besides, it's just a city, right?

     Mrs. Gwynn looks at her squarely. But the brick wall
     doesn't move an inch. Sara feels too safe behind it.


40   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                            40

     Clutching new textbooks, Sara starts down the hallway.
     She's hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic
     in her heart. She's surrounded. Alone. Every inch of
     her feels afraid.


     SARA'S POV

     as she MOVES FORWARD. A crush of KIDS -- mostly black
     with a sprinkling of white and Latino faces thrown in.
     Kids like her. Only they don't dress like her. They
     dress like commercials for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin
     Klein. And they definitely don't sound like her...

                                TEENAGER #1
                  Yo, man, check it, the
                  muthafuckers wasn't playin', they
                  was jackin'. Ten rides in five
                  days. For real.

                                TEENAGER #2
                  Fools got caught for real too.
                  Ten years in five days. Stall
                  that shit!

     Sara walks on, taking this netherworld in, eavesdropping
     on other conversations. It's not just the words. It's
     how they say them: Loud. Matter-of-fact. Cool. A
     cooler cool. Like they breathe static electricity.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               16.

40   CONTINUED:                                                      40

     That's it! The entire student body is energized. Sara's
     thoughts are jolted by two black girls squeezing by. One
     clips Sara's elbow as she passes, knocking it against a
     locker. They keep going as if they don't see her. No
     one seems to see her. Welcome to mass avoidance at
     Patterson High.


41   AT SARA'S LOCKER       - LATER                                  41

     Sara's back is to a black girl striding purposefully
     toward her. CHENILLE -- tall, pretty, with about a
     million braids in her hair -- swoops Sara's backpack from
     the floor. Thrusts it at her.

                                CHENILLE
                  That's how easy it is to give to
                  charity around here. Don't put
                  your shit on the floor.

                                   SARA
                            (cautions a smile)
                  Thanks.

     She closes her locker, starts to say something else.
     She's eager to make a friend. One friend. But
     Chenille's gone.


42   ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                                42

     Sara memorizes the schedule of classes in her hand. She
     passes a clutch of students who surround a kid in the
     middle like a horseshoe. Sara gets a fleeting glimpse of
     him.


     SARA'S POV - PATRICK REYNOLDS

     Eye candy: Tall. Dark. Heartbreakingly handsome. If
     Patterson were a monarchy, Patrick would be king. He
     sure holds court like one, turning on his dazzling smile
     and abundant charm for the crowd. One gets the sense

43   INT. JURASINSKI'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                           43

     The room's seen better days. Probably better teachers
     too. MR. JURASINSKI looks out at his American Literature
     class and sees nothing but tenure.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                   JURASINSKI
                  In Cold Blood    represents a turning
                  point in our    country's literature.
                  Take the cap    off and tell me why
                  that is, Mr.    Ricard.

     WIDER to include the class. FAVOR "SNOOKIE" RICARD. We
     recognize him from the hallway kids wrapped up in
     Patrick. Snookie, a flagrant Patrick wannabe, sits next
     to him now. He removes his baseball cap. Thoughtfully
     twirls it on a finger. He truly believes he's being
     profound.

                                 SNOOKIE
                  Gay rights. That Compote dude who
                  wrote it? Sweet tooth. Straight-
                  up fag, Mr. J.

                                JURASINSKI
                  Thank you, Mr. Ricard. Your
                  genius grant is in the mail.
                  Anyone else?

     No volunteers. Jurasinski looks for someone to put on
     the spot. Sees the new girl in a back corner. Johnson.
     He gets into her line of sight. The class shifts in
     their seats, peeping her.

                                JURASINSKI
                  Ms... Johnson. You can catch up
                  later. If this is over your head.

     Everyone looks at her.        The way kids look at new kids.

                                SARA
                  It's a non-fiction novel. The
                  first of its kind. Capote mixed
                  true events with things he
                  couldn't know, so he made them up.

     A small murmur goes up.        Over this, the voice of a
     dissenter.

                                PATRICK (O.S.)
                  White folks back then felt safe.
                  Capote scared 'em. He took hard
                  core crime out the ghetto and
                  dropped it in America's back yard.
                  That's what makes the book
                  special.

     Sara cranes to see him. God. It's pretty-boy. He's
     sitting on the other side of the classroom. Looking...
     pretty. Looking at her. He has nice eyes. Not that she
     noticed.

                                 SARA
                  Yeah.   That is part of it.

                             PATRICK
               That's all of it. Capote wasn't
               first. Richard Wright and James
               Baldwin did the same thing.
               Wasn't nobody tryin' to read them
               though.

                                SARA
                  Lots of people read them.

     A defensive save.      Patrick sees right through it.

                                PATRICK
                  Lots of people like who?      You?
                  Hello. Didn't think so.

                                SNOOKIE
                  Mr. J.! Girl needs to bone up.
                  Give her a pass to the lib'ary.

     The room erupts in laughter.


     ON SARA

     flushed in the face.      Embarrassed.     Pissed.

     ANGLE WIDENS as Jurasinski quiets the class.           Then.

                                JURASINSKI
                  She can have your pass, Mr.
                  Ricard. Since you obviously never
                  use it.


44   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAFETERIA - NOON                             44

     boisterous students.


45   CAFETERIA - FOOD LINE - LATER                                        45

     Hundreds of voices unleashed in pure, unadulterated
     teenage cacophony. Sara's in a queue of kids, working
     her way down the line.

     She's as invisible and anonymous as ever. CAMERA TRACKS
     her FROM the line, TO the cashier, INTO the heart of the
     dining hall. She stands with a food tray, looking for a
     place to sit.


     HER POV

     Table cliques of the cafeteria.


     SERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS


46   JOCK TABLE                                                    46

     Two tables pushed together.    Full.


47   NERD TABLE                                                    47

     Barely, pathetically populated but surprisingly diverse.


48   HIP-HOP TABLE                                                 48

     Loud, overflowing, fun.    King Patrick and his loyal
     subjects horse around.


49   POPULAR TABLE                                                 49

     Over which a glacial beauty we will come to know as NIKKI
     DAVIS presides. Girls only.


50   WHITE TABLE

     Notable for its glaring absence of color.    A girl we will
     come to know as TONI sits there.

     And then PUSHING IN ON --


51   CHENILLE'S TABLE                                              51

     She's there with a group of girls who eschew pretense.
     They, like Chenille, are rugged and regular. They know
     who they are.

     END OF SERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS.

                                                             20.

     eyeing Chenille's table. Screwing up courage as she
     approaches it. She gets there but two black girls are
     faster. They sit down in the only empty seats. Sara
     backs off, invisible again.


     ON CHENILLE

     glimpsing Sara from the corner of her eye as Sara walks
     away.


53   AT NERDS' TABLE - LATER                                       53

     Time has    passed. The cafeteria is half as full, half as
     noisy.     Sara sits among the NERDS, a friendly if verbose
     group.     She's trying to eat but a snooze button is
     talking    her to death...

                                WONK
                  ... I know you're new to the
                  table, but think about it. We're
                  the Y2K generation and nobody
                  takes us seriously. We don't take
                  ourselves seriously. Just look
                  around. Half the student body is
                  D.O.A. -- and that's from the neck
                  up, Clara.

                                 SARA
                  Sara.   It's Sara.

                                CHENILLE (O.S.)
                  Yeah. It's Sara. And you're
                  boring her from the ears down.

     Sara looks up, surprised to see Chenille standing there.
     She flashes a knowing smile at her, indicates Sara's
     tray.

                                  CHENILLE
                  You finished?

     Sara leaps up with a quick, grateful nod. Beats a hasty
     retreat from the table. As she and Chenille walk through
     the cafeteria, Sara shudders with relief. She feels
     rescued.

                                  SARA
                  God!    Thank you!

                         (laughs)
                  Gotta watch where you sit, girl.
                  And it's Chenille. But you're
                  still welcome. Let's catch some
                  air before the bell rings.


54   EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER                                       54

     Sara follows Chenille into the "QUAD," four squared off
     sections outside the cafeteria. There are a few dry-
     rotted picnic tables scattered around. Other kids -- and
     they run the gamut -- are seen in clots, sneaking
     smokes... horsing around... making out.


     SARA'S POV - KIDS OF QUAD

     And OVER the sound of HIP-HOP MUSIC, a pair of feet.
     Moving. Dancing. CAMERA PANS UP to reveal Nikki. She's
     demonstrating some moves to the girls from the popular
     table. Nikki's dancing her ass off, showing off.


     BACK TO SCENE

                                SARA
                  What's it called? What she's
                  doing?

                                CHENILLE
                  A dance.

                                SARA
                         (a look; knows that)
                  No, I mean... the step, the...

     She trails off as she catches someone in the corner of
     her eye. She turns away from Chenille, gradually
     focusing on --


     PATRICK

     playing cards with Snookie at one of the picnic tables.
     He glances up to see Sara. Glowering at him. He grins.

     Sara rolls her eyes, turns away.      Mutters loudly to
     herself.

                                SARA
                  Asshole.

              Asshole beaucoup. In this crowd,
              you gotta be more specific.

                            SARA
                     (covertly indicates
                      Patrick)
              He's in one of my classes. Thinks
              he's so... smart. So cute.

                             CHENILLE
               I don't know about cute but he is
               smart. Real smart. Real trip,
               too.

                             SARA
               So you know him?

                             CHENILLE
               Patrick Reynolds? Hell yeah, I
               know him. He's my brother.

     Chenille waits for Sara to swallow her tongue.     Enjoys a
     laugh.


     ANGLE SHIFTS TO PATRICK

     as Nikki approaches him. Sexy, standoffish and
     conceited, she's the stuff of wet dreams and futile
     longing. She sits down next to Patrick. Close to him.
     Snookie watches her, much amused.

                             NIKKI
               You comin' tonight?

     Patrick keeps playing his hand.     Responds very coolly.

                               PATRICK
               Gotta work.

                             NIKKI
               You already skipped three
               meetings.
                      (as he's ignoring
                       her)
               Is it because of me? Everybody on
               the committee thinks it's because
               of me. Us.
                      (infuriated by his
                       silence)

                  I'm in charge of the prom. So
                  show up. Don't make me fire your
                  ass.

     Fighting words. Snookie holds his breath. Patrick
     throws out a card, turns slowly to Nikki with a withering
     stare in his eyes.

                                PATRICK
                  You already fired my ass, Nikki.
                  Once and done. Over. Out. 'Bye.

     She stalks off. Snookie oogles her departure, peers at
     Patrick, about to say something. Patrick cuts him off,
     indicates cards.

                               PATRICK
                 Hit me and shut the hell up.

                 might be the time to forget
                 mistakes that was made. Shoot.
                 You been with the girl since ninth
                 grade.

                                PATRICK

     MALAKAI RHINEHART, 17, heading toward them. Powerfully
     built and edgy with insolence, Malakai is like a tightly-

                                MALAKAI
                  Shut the fuck up and step your
                  lame ass off, Snookie. You heard
                  me. Space.

     Snookie haughtily, comedically obliges.        A moment.

                                PATRICK
                  What happened to you at lunch,
                  man?

                                MALAKAI
                  Business.

     Short-hand. Patrick understands it, nods. Malakai slips
     the cigarette from behind his ear, openly lights and
     starts smoking it. CAMERA TRACKS them walking back
     toward Patterson.

                                PATRICK
                  So you're hangin' in, man?
                  Feelin' strong about being back?

                                MALAKAI
                  Not at this motherfucker. Out a
                  week and where am I? Fucking home
                  sweet high school. Jail away from
                  jail. You can have it.

                                PATRICK
                  You gonna stay though.   Right?

                                MALAKAI
                  Judge says it's school or JuVee
                  and I sure as hell ain't goin'
                  back there. Shit. I never knew a
                  year could be such a long time.

     A flash of commiseration, of guilt, crosses Patrick's
     face. They're at the doors now. Most of the kids have
     gone. Malakai puts his cigarette out on the floor as
     they step in.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             25.

                  You up for some hoops after
                  school? Break your free-throw
                  back in. Chump the chumps like we
                  used to.

                               MALAKAI
                  Up for it? Hell-the-fuck yeah,
                  man. Let's do it.


55   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - THAT DAY (AFTER SCHOOL)                 55

     Sara exits with Chenille. A CAR HORN starts to blare.
     Both of them ignore it. But it goes on like a musical
     number. Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a
     stone when she looks across the street. Roy's parked at
     the curb, waiting for her. She rolls her eyes and he
     HONKS AGAIN. Then he waves at her. Waves! Chenille
     looks at Sara. Then at Roy.

                                CHENILLE
                  That's your old man? Now he's
                  cute.

                                SARA
                  He's embarrassing.

                                 CHENILLE
                          (laughs)
                  Yeah.   He is. For you.


56   INT./EXT. ROY'S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS ACTION                     56

     Sara climbs in, slams the door. Roy looks over at her,
     unaware of how annoyed she is with him. She's a clenched
     fist inside.

                                 ROY
                  How'd it go?

                                 SARA
                  Fine.
                      (as he pulls off)
               Tomorrow I catch the bus.


57   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - SARA'S "ROOM" - NIGHT                  57

     Sara's moving the partition around, trying to make her
     room more like a room. Trying to build another wall
     between her and Roy.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               26.

57   CONTINUED:                                                       57

                                 ROY (O.S.)
                  Hey, Sara.   C'mere a minute.

     Sara lets out a heavy sigh.        What does he want?

                                 SARA
                  What?

                             ROY (O.S.)
               Just come here.

     She walks into the kitchen. Roy's in front of the open
     freezer door. Grinning from ear to ear. He motions her
     over. Sara crosses to the freezer. Looks inside.


     INSERT - INSIDE FREEZER

     It's full of frozen dinners.       They're in unruly, lopsided
     stacks.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Roy regards her expectantly.

                                ROY
                  Hungry and Healthys. I asked at
                  the market. They're the best.
                  So. What do you feel like?
                         (whimsically)
                  Lamb Chop Suey? Tropical Tuna?
                  Primavera Paradise?

                                SARA
                  I had a big lunch.

     Roy, deflated, closes the freezer door, trails her into
     the living area. Sara's clenching again. There's no
     escaping him.

                                ROY
                  What do you wanna do? You wanna
                  hang out with me? Go to my gig.
                  You can if you want.

                                SARA
                  It's a school night, Roy.

                                 ROY
                  Right.   School night.    Got it.

                                                            27.

58   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SARA - LATER            58

     Roy's gone. Sara takes her first good look around. A
     mess. It drives home where she is. What she's lost.
     It's overwhelming.


59   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CLOSE ON EMPTY T.V.         59
     DINNER TRAY - NIGHT

     An empty beer bottle, one askew kitchen chair. Vestiges
     of Roy's meal. ANGLE WIDENS as Sara enters. She opens
     the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche
     of falling food. A box of Sugar Puffs cereal lands at
     her feet. Something else out of place. She picks it up,
     jams everything back into the freezer. Slams the door
     shut.

                                                SHOCK CUT TO:


60   SARA                                                         60

     in a whirlwind, cleaning the apartment. Wall to wall.
     Scrubbing away what's churned up inside. The dervish
     ends in her "room," where she finishes unpacking.
     Several layers into a suitcase, she comes to her ballet
     shoes. The sight hits her like a slap in the face. Sara
     stares at the shoes until her eyes blur. Then she
     snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet.


61   EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS -             61
     MORNING

     Patrick, Chenille, Snookie straggle through the dreary
     jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the
     way to school. It's quiet now but the scars of past
     battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of
     its corners, are evident everywhere.

                             SNOOKIE
               I need a date --

                              CHENILLE
               Why?   Your hand busy?

                             SNOOKIE
               -- For the prom. And if it wasn't
               for that kinda undue attitude, you
               could be the lucky girl, Chenille.
               My personal prom queen. I can see
               us now.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                              28.

61   CONTINUED:                                                     61

                                CHENILLE
                  You must be lookin' in your
                  dreams.

     Snookie glances at Patrick.       He's somewhere else.

                                  SNOOKIE
                  Help me, man.    Defend me.

                                PATRICK
                  I got my own problems, Snook.

                             SNOOKIE
               What problems? You goin' to
               college. Doctor college after
               that. You large, man.

                             PATRICK
               I ain't gonna be doctor nothin' if
               I don't get in and I'm not in 'til
               I get my letter.

                             CHENILLE
               It's in the mail, Patrick.       Okay?

                             SNOOKIE
                      (wishfully thinking)
               I probably coulda been a doctor
               too. If I hadn't got left back
               that time.

                             CHENILLE
               That time? What? Fifth and sixth
               grade don't count?

     Patrick finally laughs. Then his face changes. Becomes
     serious. He hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them.
     They continue on like this, the ruins of their world in
     the b.g. behind them.


62   INT./EXT CITY BUS/BALTIMORE STREETS - MORNING                  62

     The bus is crammed with kids. Sara, seated by a window,
     doesn't bother looking out. Inside's more interesting.
     The kids cut up. Singing, rapping, and jousting with
     each other. Some even manage to read. Sara watches with
     immunity. She's invisible to them.


63   EXT. BUS STOP (NEAR PATTERSON HIGH) - MORNING                  63

     Sara alights just as Patrick, Chenille, and Snookie walk
     past. Patrick's the only one to see her and their eyes
     briefly connect.

                                                            29.

64   INT. HALLWAY NEAR ENTRANCE (PATTERSON HIGH) -                 64
     CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Patrick and Chenille pass through metal detectors, watch
     Snookie clown his way through. The security guard shakes
     his head. All three begin to walk. Snookie, bobbing and
     jiving, doesn't see Mrs. Gwynn coming up from behind.
     Her voice stops him cold.

                             MRS. GWYNN
                      (as Patrick and
                       Chenille look on)
               Light on your feet? Good. Be
               sure they dance into my office
               next week.

     She moseys on.   Snookie regards Patrick's smile, shakes
     his head.


65   INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - LATER THAT MORNING                       65

     The class has donned lab coats and is ready   to begin when
     Sarah rushes in. She tries to slink into a    seat. The
     teacher, MR. HILL, gives her a disapproving   look, points
     at one of several formulas (C2,H6,O2) on the   blackboard.
     Sara just looks at him

                             MR. HILL
               We're cooking today, Ms. Johnson.
               This is your first lab. You'll
               need a partner. Mr. Reynolds --
               Patrick -- will show you the
               ropes.

     Patrick bounces a smile off unsettled Sara.     This should
     be fun.


66   INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - MINUTES LATER                            66

     The class, in safety goggles and gloves, has partnered
     up.


     ANGLE ON SARA AND PATRICK

     He's holding two vials. Sara picks up a beaker. Stares
     at the blackboard. She has no idea -- and no intention
     of admitting it.

                             PATRICK
                      (very casually)
               That's too big.

     She glints at him, grits through her teeth.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                30.

66   CONTINUED:                                                       66

                                SARA
                  I know it's too big.

     She puts the beaker down. Picks up a vial. Flips
     through her textbook. Her eyes shift from it to the
     blackboard, trying to make a connection. She settles on
     one. Picks up a vial of powder. Patrick grabs her hand,
     leans over and whispers.

                            PATRICK
              I wouldn't do that if I were you.

                            SARA
                     (yanks her hand back)
              Who died and made you teacher?

     Patrick pulls back, looks at her. He can't believe she
     dissed him. A small smile forms on his face. Sara turns
     away from it, goes back to her vials. Patrick slides to
     the farthest end of the table. Watches her consternation
     with bemusement.

                            PATRICK
              Know the difference between ethyl
              glycol and methyl acetate? Both
              got three elements, two parts the
              same. It's that first part, C2
              versus C3. C3 could blow a vial
              right out a person's hand.

     Sara thinks he's messing with her. But then the contents
     of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. Panicked, she
     drops the vial into their sink. It instantly goes up in
     smoke. Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat.
     Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. The
     class stops cold. Hill rushes up to them. Once he's
     sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick.

                                MR. HILL
              What happened?      Everybody back in
              your seats!

     Patrick stares at Sara.     Her face is red.     She's biting
     her lip.

                                PATRICK
                  I misread the component.

                                MR. HILL
                         (even more angry now)
                  You? You misread a component.
                  Don't give me that, Patrick. You
                  were screwin' around!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                31.

66   CONTINUED:                                                       66

     Hill's tone is searing. He turns to     Sara. She's trying
     to say something but the words won't    come out. Hill
     regards her wearily, then walks off    pushing the curious
     class back to their stations. Sara     looks at Patrick,
     weakly mouths "thanks."


67   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                           67

     Over the sound of GRUNTING... OPEN CLOSE ON a girl's
     plump ass. Squirming in too-tight gym shorts that hug
     the cheeks. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a stout white girl on
     a balance beam. Trying to get her legs to stand up on
     it. Hanging on for dear life. From somewhere around
     her, a WHISTLE BLOWS.

                                TEACHER (O.S.)
                  Alright, Ms. Diggs. Time!

     WIDEN to see the teacher and her class (FAVOR Sara,
     Chenille, and Nikki). Amid snickers, the stout girl
     ("DIGGY") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher
     with her head demurely cast down. Clearing the teacher,
     Diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air.
     Gives up the double bird with much attitude. The class
     loves it. Cheers it. Until the teacher swerves around.


67   SERIES OF CLOSE CUTS                                             67

     Chenille on balance beam.    competent but average.

     Nikki on balance beam.    Agile.   Self-assured.   Good.

     ... And then TIGHTER STILL on Sara. Tentatively
     approaching the balance beam. Mindful of all the eyes on
     her, all the bated breaths. All waiting to see the new
     girl fall on her ass. Sara swings herself onto the beam
     with aplomb. Her legs and body are strong, supple,
     pliable rubber bands. She flounces across it on her
     tiptoes. Does a flawless split. Hops off. Looks out.


     SARA'S POV - TEACHER AND CLASS

     Reacting with shock and surprise. Awed. Except for
     Nikki. She stands there with her arms folded.
     Simmering. Envious.


68   PATTERSON HIGH - END OF SCHOOL THAT DAY                          68

     Sara. Heading down the steps with other students.
     Chenille and Diggy break through the logjam, catch up to
     her.

                                CHENILLE
                  Girl, how you get your legs to
                  twist like that?

                                DIGGY
                         (wildly gesticulating)
                  Yeah. What was all that double-
                  jointed cheerleader shit?

                                   CHENILLE
                  This is Diggy.     Thinks she's down.

                                   DIGGY
                  Egg-cuse me?     I am down.

                                 CHENILLE
                  So, Sara.   What's up with that?

                                SARA
                         (awkwardly)
                  Nothing's up with it. I used to
                  kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly.

     Chenille makes an impressed face.          Regards Sara
     curiously.

                                CHENILLE
                  You should hit Feetz with us
                  tomorrow night. It's a club.
                  Sorta members only.

                                   DIGGY
                  Un-der-ground.

                            SARA
              I don't know...

                            CHENILLE
              Come on and hang out. Snook dee's
              sometime. He can get you in.
                     (yelling)
              Yo, Snook

     Sara sees Snookie... then Patrick... loping her way. She
     steels herself. He's going to say something, crack some
     joke about her nearly blowing him up. But Patrick just
     stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes. A nice
     twinkle. Sara's not entirely immune to it. Chenille
     breaks their eye play, pushes Patrick aside. She grabs
     Snookie's arm, indicates Sara.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                CHENILLE
                  She needs to get hooked up for
                  Feetz. All the way up. Sara,
                  give Snook twenty dollars.

                                SARA
                  For what?

                                SNOOKIE
                  I.D. Eye-dee. How you think you
                  gettin' in? On your looks?
                         (rolling his eyes)
                  Chenille, your girl is weak.
                  Shit. I got my rep to watch. I
                  can't just be gettin' any green
                  in.

     Sara glares.     Regards Snookie with a sweeping scowl.

                                SARA
                  Look closer. And if I still look
                  green, I think maybe you should
                  wipe the crust from your eyes.

     Snookie's jaw drops. Patrick cracks up. Diggy too.
     Chenille's stays on point. She's about solving the
     problem.

                                CHENILLE
                  You gonna pay the man or what?

                                SNOOKIE
                  She ain't got it. Look at her.
                  Loud-talkin' me and broke as a
                  damn promise.

     Sara, put on the spot, pulls out the money.     Snookie
     snatches it.

                                SARA
                  I don't even know where it is.

                                CHENILLE
                  So we'll hook up at my house. Go
                  together. I will have your I.D.

     Snookie shrugs affirmatively. Patrick looks directly at
     Sara. The twinkle in his eye is gone, replaced by fair
     warning.

                            PATRICK
              Feetz ain't no square dance.

                            SARA
              That's okay. I dance in circles.
              Probably around you.

                                                            34.

69   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                   69

     Roy walks in to see Sara on the futon in her pajamas
     reading a book. She's got a head full of rollers.

                              ROY
               I'm splittin'.
                      (as she barely looks up)
               Whatcha readin'?

                              SARA
               Chemistry.

                             ROY
               You're takin' chemistry?

                             SARA
               Right now it's taking me.

                             ROY
               Give yourself some time. Well.
               See ya in the mornin'. Maybe I'll
               call between sets.

     Sara really looks up.   Gives him an angelic, sluggish
     shrug.

                             SARA
               I'll be asleep.

     He leaves. As soon as Sara hears the front DOOR CLOSE,
     she jumps up, strips down to bra and panties, races to
     the closet. One hand rips the rollers from her hair, the
     other rips through outfits. She's frantic and unsure
     about choosing the right one.


70   EXT. "BLACK" STREET (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                70

     Sara. In a skin-tight miniskirt and a bolero jacket.
     Looking more eighties than nineties, more cute than cool.
     She walks with tentative, jittery purpose down this
     poverty stricken street. Doesn't meet anyone's eye. But
     can feel the eyes on her. She keeps going. She's walked
     too far to turn back.


71   EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PROJECTS - SARA - NIGHT               71

     Approaching the malignant edifices as the Heights begin
     to come to life... or death, depending how luck's
     running. Sara walks into this world of shadows and
     despite a trepidation, finds something fascinating about
     the possibility of real danger.

                                                           35.

72   EXT./INT. REYNOLDS APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT                72

     Chenille triple unlocks the door, lets Sara in. Sara's
     surprised -- the apartment is surprisingly quaint and
     extremely neat. It looks a helluva lot better than Roy's
     place. Chenille is dressed in hugely baggy military-
     style pants and a tube top with a form-fitting, short-cut
     leather coat over it. Sara takes it in.

                              SARA
               Cool outfit.

                              CHENILLE
               Slammin'.   Slammin' outfit.

                             SARA
               ... I look okay?

     Chenille gives her the once over.   Decides to lie.

                             CHENILLE
               Yeah.  You look okay.
                      (then)
               Moma Dean. I'm leavin'.


     FROM ANOTHER ANGLE

     GRANDMOMMA DEAN enters with a toddler ("CHRISTOPHER") in
     her arms. She sports snow white, waist-length dreads and
     she's wearing a dashiki lounger. Despite her white
     locks, she doesn't look old enough to be a grandmother.
     She hands Christopher to Chenille. Inspects Sara. Her
     eyes are open, kind.

                             CHENILLE
                      (fussing over
                       Christopher)
               Grandmom, Sara. Sara, Grandmom.
               Also known as Momma Dean. And
               handsome here is Christopher.

                              SARA
               Hi.

                             MOMMA DEAN
               Hello. Now don't get him all
               riled up, Chenille. I want to get
               some sleep tonight.

     Chenille kisses Christopher, hands him off to Momma Dean.
     They exit. Sara looks tentatively at Chenille.

                             SARA
               Is that... is he... yours?

                             CHENILLE
               He sure ain't Momma Dean's.

                                                           36.

73   INT./EXT. CAB/STREET (MOVING) - SARA AND CHENILLE           73
     - NIGHT

     They've been talking.   Well, Chenille has. Sara's been
     listening. Intently.    Liking this confidence they're
     sharing.

                             CHENILLE
               ... He'll be one in July. Best
               mistake I ever made. Kenny --
               Christopher's father -- he's the
               worst. Triflin'. Okay?


74   EXT. 6TH AND BROADWAY (EAST BALTIMORE) - NIGHT              74

     A curbed cab. Sara and Chenille get out. Chenille digs
     into her pocketbook, hands Sara her I.D. PUSH IN ON
     photo of obese white girl with an untamed trailer trash
     perm. Sara's eyes go wide.

                              SARA
               Chenille.   She's ugly.   She's fat!

                            CHENILLE
              She's twenty-one too. I ain't got
              all night. Let's hop.

                            SARA
              Wait. I have to ask you
              something.
                     (hard for her)
              Do I really look alright?

     An unspoken thing passes between them. Chenille suddenly
     whips off her coat. Gestures at Sara with her head.

                             CHENILLE
               Gimme that '89 Madonna shit.    Your
               jacket. Give it here.

     Sara takes off the bolero. Chenille ties it around her
     own neck, then yanks Sara's miniskirt down around her
     hips. Sara's torso is clad in a long-sleeved cotton tee.
     Chenille frowns at it.

                             SARA
               It's from the GAP.

                             CHENILLE
               It's country. You look country in
               it. Take it off.

                             SARA
               I'm not walking in there in my
               bra.

74   CONTINUED:                                                  74

     Chenille thrusts her leather coat at her. Sara can't
     believe what she's doing, getting (un)dressed on a public
     street! She pulls off the tee, slips on Chenille's coat.
     Buttons it as far as the buttons go. Looks down. Half
     her chest is exposed.


75   EXT. ALLEY (EAST BALTIMORE) - SARA AND CHENILLE - NIGHT     75

     Gaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse.
     Chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to
     get inside.

                                 CHENILLE
                  Rope dopes.   C'mon.

     She leads Sara to the door of FEETZ. The Sumo-sized MAN
     guarding it knows Chenille, digs her. His grin exposes
     gold-capped teeth.

                               DOORMAN
               Chenille.    Lookin' fine.   As
               always.

                             CHENILLE
               Too fine to stand in line?

     The Man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- "in" being
     just inside the front door. A BOUNCER there collects the
     $10.00 cover charge. Checks their I.D. He hands Sara's
     back with a smirk.

                             BOUNCER
               Changed your hair.

     He waves a metal detector over their bodies, nods to yet
     another bouncer who escorts Sara and Chenille through yet
     another door.


76   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               76

     They march a short distance to an old elevator where a
     group of kids wait. Bouncer #2 engages the elevator.
     Everyone piles in.


77   INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION                           77

     Sara holds onto her stomach as the CREAKY ELEVATOR
     descends and the MUSIC below rises. The elevator's
     vibrating with music.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                SARA
                         (an inside to Chenille)
                  Can't get much more underground
                  than this.


78   INT. FEETZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            78

     A smoky hole in the wall, filled to the brim with kids.
     Mostly black kids with a few whites and Latinos melting
     in. They share a common goal: To clog the dance floor,
     flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the
     masters: Tupac Shakur, NAS, Lauryn Hill, Puff Daddy,
     etc. Here, the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed,
     from erotic to vulgar; loving to lascivious.


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Sara and Chenille. Sara's excited. She loves that she
     has to shout to be head over the music.

                                CHENILLE
                  Let's get our table 'fore it gets
                  crashed and I hafta hurt somebody.

     Sara's bewildered. She doesn't see any tables. She
     follows Chenille to the back of FEETZ. Sees six or seven
     tables. All of them have reserved signs. Most of them
     are filled.

                                SARA
                  What are you, some kind of V.I.P.?

     Chenille indicates the deejay booth.     Snookie's in it.

                             CHENILLE
               Snook hooks me up whenever he
               dees.

     They walk past a SLACKER in lycra pants and a big Army
     shirt. He licks his tongue at Chenille, grabs at her
     protruding butt. She swirls around, grabs his crotch
     hard enough to get his attention. The Slacker is
     squirming in her clutch.

                             SLACKER
               Aw'right, aw'right. You got it.

                               CHENILLE
               Got what?
                               (MORE)

                                CHENILLE (CONT'D)
                         (as he can't think of
                          anything but the
                          squeeze on his balls)
                  The right to walk past your
                  greasy, tickle dick self without
                  your paws on my ass? 'S'that how
                  I got it?

     Chenille bobs her head right in his face. Sara can't
     believe it. A few people have stopped and are looking.
     The Slacker nods hastily. Chenille releases him, gently
     smoothes out his shirt.

                                 CHENILLE
                  That's how I thought I had it.
                          (a fly wave)
                  See ya.

     She and Sara continue on to back-of-the-club tables.
     Stop at a reserved one. An adjacent table sports Nikki,
     her three girl crew... and Diggy. All nurse drinks.
     Nikki snake-eyes Sara.

                            NIKKI
              What is up with this place? Seems
              like they're lettin' anybody in.

                                 CHENILLE
                  Yeah.   And they started with you.

     The three girls and Diggy snicker. Nikki gives Chenille
     a look. Turns back to Sara with a snide smirk. Points
     out her crew.

                               NIKKI
                  I'm Nikki. Alyssa. Jasmin.
                  Tiff'nee. You know Diggy, right,
                  Marsha?

                                SARA
                  Sara. It's Sara. And I know you.
                  We have a class together.

                                NIKKI
                  That don't mean you know me.

                                CHENILLE
                  Quit it, Nikki.

                                NIKKI
                  Quit what? I ain't walkin' on
                  eggshells just 'cause you brought
                  the Brady Bunch to the Negro Club.

                                SARA
                         (kiss-my-ass polite)
                  Maybe you came to the wrong spot,
                  Nikki. I'm pretty sure this one
                  doesn't have any Negroes.

     Chenille cracks up mainly to back Sara up.       Nikki glowers
     at her.

                                NIKKI
                  I'm pretty sure you came with one.

                                CHENILLE
                  Oh, no. Uh-uh, wench. You did
                  not just call me a Negro.

     As Chenille bucks, Diggy springs up from her seat, runs
     her arm in the space between Chenille and Nikki like a
     referee.

                             DIGGY
               Alright, y'all. Chill.

                                NIKKI
                  Tell her to chill. She always got
                  somethin' to say.

                            CHENILLE
              I can say a lot more. Keep
              runnin' your mouth, Nikki. I'll
              lay all your shit bare.

     Whatever shit it is, Nikki's not taking any       chances. She
     ejects herself from the table, walks off.        The three
     girls scoot loyally after her. Diggy gets        up. Sits down
     at Sara's and Chenille's table. Diggy goes        with the
     flow. That's why she always fits in.

                                DIGGY
                  Why you burn her like that?

                                CHENILLE
                  'Cause I can't stand her ass and
                  the way she played my brother. I
                  need a drink, Sara. Let's walk.


79   INT. FEETZ - ENTRANCE - SAME TIME                                79

     Patrick and Malakai enter with two high school dropouts
     we will learn are ARVEL and LIP. Females flock to flirt
     with Patrick and Malakai, who both swell like sponges,
     soaking up the attention.

                                                                   41.

80   INT. FEETZ - BAR - SAME TIME                                        80

     Chenille pushes her way to the bar, tugging Sara along.
     A tall, angular twenty-something MAN on the far side of
     the bar sees her. She sees him. Sucks her teeth, nudges
     Sara.

                                  CHENILLE
              That's him.        Comin' over.   Kenny?
              Don't look.

     So of course Sara does. She makes a silly face at
     Chenille as Kenny sidles up to her. Chenille rolls her
     eyes half-heartedly.

                                  KENNY (MAN)
              What's up?

                            CHENILLE
              Where's my money, Kenny?

                                KENNY
                  I'm a little short this week.
                  Don't jump off. It's comin'.

                                  CHENILLE
                  It's comin'?    No. You lyin'.

                                KENNY
                  Lemme rap to you about the
                  situation on the dance floor.

     She shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell. She's
     in love with him. Enough to let him whisper in her ear,
     sweet-talk her away from the bar. Before she's swallowed
     up by the crowd, Chenille turns back to Sara, shouts:

                                  CHENILLE
                  Rum and Coke.    No ice.   Hook me
                  up.


     ON PATRICK

     splitting off from Malakai and a girl clinging to him.
     He's walking through when Nikki appears from nowhere,
     grabs his arm.

                                  NIKKI
                  Let's dance.

                                PATRICK
                         (pulling away)
                  Let's not.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                 NIKKI
                  Oh?   It's gonna be like that.

                                PATRICK
                  How'd you think it was gonna be?
                  That you was gonna drop me and
                  pick me up whenever you felt like
                  it?

                                NIKKI
                  It ain't all that serious,
                  Patrick.

                                PATRICK
                  It ain't anymore, Nikki.     Not to
                  me.

     He walks off. CAMERA TRACKS him going deep inside the
     club. He wants a drink. He's almost at the bar when he
     sees Chenille on the dance floor with Kenny. She shrugs
     a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar. Toward
     Sara. The look is like, help me out. Don't let me leave
     her hangin'. Patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at
     Sara, before he really sees her. She looks fly. Hugely
     fly. He ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's
     ear.

                                SARA
                  Rum and Coke, straight up. And a
                  beer. I don't care. Anything.

                                PATRICK (O.S.)
              Bad choice.      'Anything.'

     The closeness of his voice startles her. She turns into
     his smile. That cocksure, leave'em-weak-in-the-knees
     smile.

                                SARA
                  It's just a beer.

                                PATRICK
                  Then it should be the best beer.
                  You'd know that if you really
                  drank.

     Sara's knees straighten, her spine stiffens.         The
     asshole's back.

                                 SARA
                  Whatever.

                                PATRICK
                  What's that mean? Whatever.

                                SARA
                  Whatever you want it to mean.
                  You're the whiz kid, right? You
                  know everything.

                            PATRICK
                     (chuckles at this, at
                      her)
              Not everything. Like I don't know
              why we're standin' still.
                     (closer with a teasing
                      whisper)
              I'm supposed to be dizzy by now.
              Remember? From all those circles
              you danced around me.

     Sara leans against the bar.    The knees are going again.

                             SARA
               I don't feel like dancing.

                             PATRICK
               But you do know how...?

                             SARA
               Would I be here if I didn't?

                             PATRICK
               ... Let's do it then.    C'mon.

     He coaxes her onto the dance floor. PARLIAMENT'S funk
     classic "Flashlight" is playing. The dance crowd is
     robustly singing the refrain to the song. There's a
     party on the floor. FAVOR Sara and Patrick, facing each
     other. He's moving already. She starts to dance,
     stiffly, tentatively. Patrick smiles at her. Shakes his
     head. He grabs her hands, swings them in time to the
     music.

                             PATRICK
               Now move your hips. Not so fast.
                      (as Sara looks lost)
               Sara! Just like our hands.
                      (singing, in sync with
                       the crowd)
               'Flashlight! Neon light! Stop
               light! Everybody got a little
               light under the sun.'

     The music's beginning to feel good to Sara. Patrick lets
     go of her hands. Starts to dance. Sara watches him
     intensely, her body follows his stiffly. Patrick's a
     good teacher. He leads without leaving her. Whenever
     she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into
     another less-complicated one.

     Sara begins to pick-up on Patrick's rhythm. Her eyes
     never wander from his. And then she starts to feel
     something else. They both do. A rising beat. A
     quickening heart. And not from the dancing. She smiles
     bashfully at him. Patrick suddenly grabs her around the
     waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance. All Sara
     can do is try to keep up and hang on.


     FROM ANOTHER ANGLE

     Nikki avidly watching Sara and Patrick with Jasmin and
     Tiff'ny.

                                JASMIN
                  She's all up in your nut, Nikki...
                  Oh, that's right. It ain't your
                  nut anymore.

                                NIKKI
                  It is if I want it to be. He is
                  if I want him to be. That bitch
                  ain't got shit on me.

     The girls regard her in conspicuous, dubious silence.
     Nikki maintains her cool but inside her pride is
     pricking.


81   INT. FEETZ - SAME TIME                                        81

     Malakai and the clinging girl nuzzle in a back corner.
     She licks his ear, whispers into it. Malakai laughs.
     Then his expression abruptly darkens. A storm cloud
     comes over it. He gets up.


     MALAKAI'S POV - WALKING TOWARD

     ... two dealers a few feet away. They're talking to an
     Asian guy with a multi-colored Mohawk. One slips Mohawk
     a packet of coke, the other takes his money. WIDER as
     Malakai reaches the dealers. He doesn't explain, doesn't
     complain. He just starts swinging.


     SARA AND PATRICK

     The MUSIC changes and their dance ends. They stand there
     for a moment, a little caught up in each other. A little
     unsure of the moment. And then there's a scream!
     Several of them actually. Patrick reacts to it
     instinctively. Looking around. In a small pocket of the
     club he sees Malakai.

     in full fisticuffs with the two dealers.     Holding his
     own.


     ON PATRICK

     leaving Sara, slicing through a clot of looky-loos until
     he reaches Malakai. He jumps into the fray.


     INT. FEETZ - FIGHT - PATRICK AND MALAKAI

     A thick crowd around them, proceed to beat the living
     shit out of the two dealers.


     ANGLE ON SARA AND CHENILLE

     wrangling their way to the front line of the crowd, Diggy
     not far behind them. Sara looks on, dumbfounded and
     dazzled by what she sees, which is --


     PATRICK

     pummeling his dealer into cowering submission. Only then
     does he look over at Malakai who, eyes engorged with
     rage, is standing over his opponent, kicking and stomping
     him with no signs of letting up. Patrick can see
     Malakai's too far gone for talk. He rushes him from
     behind, nearly lifts Malakai off his feet to swing him
     away from the dealer's writhing body on the floor.


82   EXT. FEETZ - OUTSIDE VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS ACTION               82

     The exit door bursts open and Patrick and Malakai tumble
     out. Patrick bends over, cups his knees as he catches
     his breath.

                                PATRICK
                  Man, what the hell are you doin'?
                  Tryin' to get sent back up?

                  here. Squarin' off in my shit.

                                MALAKAI
                  Let it slide tonight, they come
                  back strong tomorrow. You know
                  that.

                            PATRICK
              Malakai, you fuck up parole, you
              ain't gonna back to JuVee.
              Eighteen and up, that's Jessup.
              Hardcore lockdown. You want that?

                                MALAKAI
                         (regards him coldly)
                  I want what was mine. Feetz is my
                  spot. I'ma do business here just
                  like I did before. Like we did
                  before. And if I gotta stomp some
                  niggers in my way, so be it.

     An uncertain but tense moment.     Patrick tries to salvage
     it.

                                PATRICK
                  Well, you definitely got the
                  stompin' part down.

     They look at each other.     Share a small laugh.

                                MALAKAI
                  We fucked those fools up for sure.

                                PATRICK
                         (crossing to exit door)
                  For damn sure, man.

     Patrick finds the door locked. He and Malakai hoist
     themselves over a high, wrought iron fence. Disappear
     behind it.


83   EXT. FEETZ - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT                           83

     Distant WAIL of SIRENS as Feetz begins to empty out.
     Kids converge on the sidewalks. PICK UP Sara, Chenille
     and Diggy. Waiting and watching for Patrick. Diggy
     looks at them.

                                DIGGY
                  It's about to get real out here.
                  Cops and shit. I'm gone.

     She leaves. Chenille spots Patrick. Not too worse for
     the wear. She smiles with relief. Then Sara sees him.
     She smiles too.

                                                           47.

84   EXT. STREET (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS) - NIGHT                      84

     Sara, Patrick and Chenille. Walking home. Chenille's
     preaching to Patrick. He's not in the mood.

                              CHENILLE
                ... Yeah, I'ma tell you. Tell you
                like I keep tellin' you, Patrick.
                You need to let Malakai alone.
                Let him handle his own shit before
                he drags you down in it.

                              PATRICK
                Chenille. I heard you the first
                five hundred times.

     They round a corner bordering the Heights. Stop in front
     of it. Chenille, disconcerted with Patrick, looks dourly
     at Sara.

                               CHENILLE
                I'll see you Monday.
                       (to Patrick, like an
                        order)
                He'll walk you.

     As much as this makes sense, it still takes Patrick by
     surprise. Sara sees it in his face, regards Chenille
     with a false bravado.

                              SARA
                It's just a few blocks.   It's
                okay.

                              CHENILLE
                No, it's not okay. Would you tell
                the girl it ain't okay?

                              PATRICK
                It's not okay, okay?
                       (before she can
                        protest)
                Come on, Braveheart.

     walking.   Sara keeps stealing glances of him.   Or so she
     thinks.

                               PATRICK
                What?

                               SARA

                                PATRICK
                  Why you keep lookin' at me?

                                SARA
                  I have to look somewhere. The
                  streets are deserted. Might as
                  well look at you.

                                PATRICK
                  That's not why. You wanna know
                  somethin'. Ask somethin'.

                             SARA
               It's not a question. It's the way
               you were beating that kid up. You
               looked so mad.

                                PATRICK
                  I was mad and he wasn't no kid.
                  But you're from the suburb Mars,
                  right? Folks don't fight there.

                                 SARA
                  Not like that.
                         (some kind of
                          wonder)
                  You were really kicking his ass.

     It's not funny, the look on her face.      But Patrick
     laughs.

                             SARA
               Are you laughing at me?

     Dropping the smile, Patrick shakes his head.      Looks at
     her.

                             PATRICK
               My friend was in trouble.

                             SARA
               Maybe he's my question. Your
               friend. Chenille doesn't like
               him.

                                PATRICK
                  She likes him. It don't stop her
                  from trippin' off him now and
                  then. But Malakai's good people.
                  We go back. Way back. You know,
                  like they say, through thick and
                  thin.
                         (beat)
                  So, how'd you like Feetz?

                  It was great.

                                PATRICK
                  Once you got used to the music.

                                SARA
                  It wasn't the music I wasn't used
                  to. I mean, it's not the first
                  time I heard hip-hop, Patrick.

                               PATRICK
                  Uh-huh. Bet you listen to it all
                  the time.

     Patrick regards her with a sly, knowing smile. His stare
     is significant, unsettling. Sara's face flushes. She
     turns from him, hoping he didn't see it.

                                SARA
                  Not all the time. But a lot.

                                PATRICK
                  We gettin' any closer to your crib
                  or should we stop for food and
                  water?

     Sara snaps out of it. Looks around. Shit. First the
     flush and now this. She looks at him. She could kick
     herself.

                                   SARA
                  We passed it.

                                   PATRICK
                  You passed it.

     A look. They double back to her front door.        Pause on
     the stoop.

                            SARA
              Thanks for walking me.

                                   PATRICK
              No problem.

                                SARA
              So.      I'll see ya.

                            PATRICK
              Is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz,
              had a great time, can't wait to

                  a cap in your ass if you ever
                  darken my doorstep again?

     He makes it impossible not to smile.     So damned charming.

                                SARA
                  I haven't said gee-whiz since I
                  was six. But I really had a great
                  time... okay?

                                PATRICK
                  Okay.

     She enters the rowhouse. Patrick waits until the lights
     go on inside before he turns around and starts home.


86   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING                    86

     Roy's making breakfast when Sara straggles in. She peers
     at the stove. Scrambled eggs and bacon. Toast too! A
     first for him.

                                ROY
                  Figured I'd put a little marrow in
                  your bones. Siddown, siddown.
                         (she slumps in chair)
                  You gettin' along at school?
                  Makin' friends...?
                         (as she nods robotically)
                  ... See any of 'em last night?

     He slides a plate in front of her.      Stands there holding
     his.

                                ROY
                  I came home on my break.

                                SARA
                  Oh.

     The succinct sneer in her voice gets to Roy.       He snaps at
     her.

                            ROY
              ... Oh? Jesus! You're hard!
              Look. You're seventeen. If you
              wanna go out, go out. But don't
              lie to me. On top of everything

                  So how are the eggs? They good?

     Sara takes a small, tasteless sample, nods. They eat in
     silence. Then Sara looks over at him with genuine if
     detached remorse.

                                SARA
                  You're right. I should've said
                  something. I'm sorry.

     Roy exhales.     Finally, a chink in the brick wall.

     A track from TOP DOGG BLARES from invisible SPEAKERS.
     All of the store's many customers are teenage kids.
     Snookie, in sunglasses and a reversed baseball cap,
     clerks behind the counter. He's ringing up (and trying
     to rap to) a fly girl when Patrick walks in, overhears
     the overture.

                                    SNOOKIE
                  ... How   you   know I can't do
                  nothin'   for   you? I'm the hardest
                  workin'   man   in showbizness, girl.
                  C'mon.    Let   me be the bomb in your
                  shell.

     The fly girl rolls her eyes. Takes her bag. Leaves.
     Patrick looks at Snookie, wryly shakes his head.

                                PATRICK
                  You do the shit to yourself, man.
                  The bomb in your shell?

                                SNOOKIE
                  That was black magic, Patrick.
                  It's gonna work one of these days.

     He reaches behind the counter, hands Patrick a Jay-Z C.D.

     As he says this, his eyes wander around the store.      And
     he sees her in the stacks. Sara.


88   INT. RECORD STORE - HIP-HOP SECTION - MOMENTS LATER            88

     Sara with a bunch of C.D.'s. She juggles them in one
     hand, flips through Hip-Hop C.D.'s with another. She
     looks up to see Patrick standing beside her. He takes in
     the C.D.'s. Grins at her.

                                PATRICK
                  Throwin' a party?

     There's no wiggle room but Sara wiggles anyway.

                                SARA
                  Just adding to my collection. I
                  heard some stuff I didn't have
                  last night.

                                PATRICK
                         (that twinkle in his
                          eyes)
                  Well, you were fly anyway. Last
                  night. Dancin', I mean.

                                SARA
                  Not as fly as you.

                                PATRICK
                         (half-serious)
                  Nobody's as fly as me.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                53.

                                SARA
                         (dead-serious)
                  Not yet anyway.

     Patrick laughs. Looks at her.        Sara looks back at him.
     They're staring at each other.

                                PATRICK
                  Maybe we could hook up later.
                  After school or somethin'. Work
                  on some of your moves. If you
                  want.

                                  SARA
                  Okay.   Sure.

     Patrick nods affirmatively. Starts to leave.       Turns
     back, indicates her stack of C.D.'s.

                                PATRICK
                  By the way, Hammer's pretty much
                  played out.

                                SARA
                         (convincing lie)
                  Not to me.


89   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           89

     Sara's on the phone, unwrapping one of those T.V.
     dinners.

                                SARA
                         (into phone)
                  It was so... slamming, Lindsay.
                  The dancing! I'm going again.
                  What? No, I haven't seen anybody
                  get shot yet. God, I didn't move
                  to Bosnia.


90   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING                          90

     A fight. Two black girls having at it. It's a ferocious
     match. Hair pulling, spit flying, punches landed,
     clothes torn apart.


     ANGLE ON SARA

     as she crowns the corner, comes to a bottleneck of
     students. It's like the nose bleed section of Caesar's
     Palace. The far hallway is the ring. Sara cranes her
     neck to see the action.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            54.

90   CONTINUED:                                                   90

     ANGLE WIDENS as a security guard earns his hazard pay.
     He separates the two girls who are still swinging at each
     other. He throws one into a corner, hurls the other in
     an opposite corner.


     ON SARA

     as a WHITE GIRL standing next to her shakes her head
     lamentably.

                                   SARA
                  What happened?

     The White Girl studies Sara's suburban clothes and fresh-
     scrubbed face. Thinks she found a kindred spirit.

                                TONY (WHITE GIRL)
                  We freed the slaves and didn't
                  teach them no manners.
                         (before Sara can react)
                  You're Sara, right?
                         (as Sara warily nods)
                  Toni. I was gonna introduce
                  myself before but you're always
                  with that crowd. You know.
                  Chenille, her girls, that identity
                  crisis Diggy.

     Sara looks at Toni. Getting it. Getting her. The
     expression on her face closes off. Toni, too dense to
     read it, keeps talking.

                                TONI
                         (brightly)
                  We should hang out sometime, Sara.
                  The two of us. Whenever you
                  decide to lose the tan?

     Her inference clear, Toni flashes a brilliant smile,
     happily walks off. Sara shakes her head to herself.
     What an idiot.

     As Sara continues down the hall, a P.A. address comes on.

                                P.A. ADDRESS (V.O.)
                  Seniors, a reminder before you
                  rise up and change the world.
                  Mrs. Gwynn is holding all diplomas
                  hostage in her office. Her only
                  demand is the pleasure of your
                  company for career D-Day. Be
                  there.

     Sara enters her classroom, a bunch of kids in front of
     and behind her.

                                                               55.

91   EXT./INT. STREET/ROY'S ROWHOUSE (SO. BALTIMORE) - DAY           91

     Sara walks up the street (passing many black people),
     sees Roys' pickup. Shit. He's home.


92   CAMERA TRACKS                                                   92

     Sara as she enters their rowhouse, walks up a flight of
     stairs to their apartment. There's a JAZZ INSTRUMENTAL
     FAINTLY coming from it. And another NOISE. Foreign and
     yet familiar. Like grunting... but not. Sara unlocks
     the door. Opens it.


93   SARA'S POV - LIVING ROOM                                        93

     Her father's fucking somebody! On the couch. Half on it
     anyway. In broad daylight! The whore underneath him is
     moaning. Jesus!

     ANGLE WIDENS as Sara turns away from the spectacle.
     Reaches for Roy's sax. She blows the longest, shrillest
     note known to mankind.


94   ON ROY                                                          94

     The hair on his head stands up.    His body deflates
     instantly.


95   INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                                    95

     Sara sits at the table. Roy enters in a wrinkled T-shirt
     and battered jeans. His embarrassment is naked.

                             ROY
               I don't know what to say.    I
               don't.

                             SARA
               How 'bout fuck it? Or should I
               say fuck her? It's a fuck-fest,
               Roy.

                                ROY
               Don't talk to    me like that, Sara.
                      (beat)
               I thought you    were goin' to your
               friend's house    after school.
               Obviously, you    changed your mind.
               So I'm sorry.     Alright?

                             SARA
               Sorry you got caught.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            56.

95   CONTINUED:                                                   95

                                ROY
                  Sorry I got... observed

     The "whore" with the Hich C is RHONDA. She stands
     between the living area and the kitchen entrance now.
     Sara tries not to look at her. Can't help it. She has
     to see the whore. Not bad looking, in a washed out,
     bottle blonde barfly kind of way.

                                RHONDA
                  Don't be mad at him. It's my
                  fault. I'm real sorry, honey.

                                ROY
                  It's nobody's 'fault.' It's over.
                  Let it be over. We're all adults.

     Sara glares at him.     The disingenuous Rhonda jumps in.

                                RHONDA
                  I think he means you know about
                  sex. That we have it and he likes
                  it. Isn't that what you mean,
                  Roy?

     Sara looks at her.     Bats her eyes.   Hard.

                                 SARA
                  Really?   How often do you have it?

                                RHONDA
                  Things been kind of slow since you
                  got here. Once upon a time we
                  were real rabbits, weren't we,
                  Roy?

     Verbal quicksand.      Roy can feel himself sinking.

                                 ROY
                  Rhonda.   Shut up.   Please.


96   INT. SARA'S ROOM - NOT MUCH LATER                            96

     OPEN CLOSE ON a framed photo of Glynn and Sara (in full
     ballet costume). Embracing. Happy. PULL BACK to see
     Sara. Sitting on the edge of her futon, holding Glynn's
     clover leaf necklace and staring at her mother's face.
     Lost. Lonely. Missing her. She kisses the lucky charm,
     smiles at Glynn, slips the necklace on.

                                                             57.

97   INT./EXT. CAR WASH - DAY                                      97

     Patrick, in coveralls, slouches over a mechanic's station
     studying. A few workers mill about, waiting for the next
     car on a slow day. A BMW with tinted windows peels into
     the lot on two wheels. Patrick looks up as Malakai and a
     tall, wiry, nattily dressed man get out.

                                PATRICK
               I got it.

     He exits into the lot.    Approaches Malakai and the man
     ("TUTE").

                                MALAKAI
               Medicine Man.     You know Tute.

     Tute takes in Patrick.    Looks around.   Snickers
     derisively.

                             TUTE
               You call this a job, man?

                             PATRICK
               Actually, I call it a car wash.
               The work I do, yeah, that's a job.

     Malakai lets out a nervous laugh.     Tute doesn't crack a
     smile.

                              TUTE
               I need some sticks.    Watch my
               ride, Malakai.

     Tute enters the cashier's office.    Patrick looks at
     Malakai.

                             PATRICK
               You hangin' with him now?    Think
               that's a good idea, 'Kai?

                             MALAKAI
               You got a better one?

                             PATRICK
               You could try layin' all this shit
               off for awhile. Give yourself a
               chance on the other side.

                             MALAKAI
               What other side?

                             PATRICK
               You know what I mean. It ain't
               like you don't have good sense.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                               58.

                                MALAKAI
                  I got sense enough to know who I
                  am, what I can do and where I can
                  do it. I ain't like you. People
                  don't just up and hand me shit.

     Tute emerges from cashier's office lighting a cigarette
     from a fresh pack. He blows a plume of smoke into the
     air, regards Patrick.

                             TUTE
               We ain't here for our health.     You
               workin', then work.
                      (throws Patrick
                       car keys)
               And don't forget the rims.


98   INT. REYNOLDS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN -                98
     LATE THAT NIGHT

     Patrick, still in work coveralls, enters. First thing he
     does is pick up a stack of mail. Tracking him into
     kitchen as he crosses to refrigerator, takes out a plate
     Momma Dean's left for him. He sits down at the table,
     takes a breath, begins shifting through the mail. His
     face registers disappointment. Nothing. Again.


99   INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY                          99

     Patrick sits across from Mrs. Gwynn, the reality check of
     Patterson High.

                             MRS. GWYNN
               Maybe you think it's enough to
               have the grades, get a full
               scholarship. But it isn't,
               Patrick. Georgetown makes mulch
               of students like you every
               semester. You have to be ready to
               change. Change friends.
               Lifestyle. Your entire point of
               view. What I'm saying is, options
               won't matter if you don't keep a
               clean nose to the grindstone.

                             PATRICK
                      (looks her right in
                       the eye)
               I know that, Mrs. Gwynn.

     The unflappable Patrick.    He doesn't fool Mrs. Gwynn.

                   you're asking. Things happen.
                   Things change. And the changes
                   change you. What's the point of
                   plans?

                   I see here that you trained for
                   Juilliard, that you auditioned.

                             SARA
               That was a long time ago.

                             MRS. GWYNN
               It was three months ago, Sara.
                      (the brick wall)
               Well, if you're not going to
               pursue dance, what are you going
               to do?

                   I don't know. Take a year off.
                   Work. Go to college later on.

                                 MRS. GWYNN
                   Be careful with later on, Sara.
                   It's a slippery slope. Sometimes
                   you can run right on top of it and
                   it never catches up with you.


109   EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS - ROOFTOP - LATE DAY                   109

      A low sun over the cityscape of Baltimore. PUSH IN ON
      Patrick and Sara, two dots that grow larger. He CLICKS
      ON a BOOM-BOX resting on the roof's ledge. A hip-hop
      track BLASTS.

                                 PATRICK
                   Feel the groove. Don't let the
                   music mess with you.

      He starts to move with the music. Sara tries to emulate
      him. They dance throughout the conversation.

                                 SARA
                   Did you always want to be a
                   doctor?

                                 PATRICK

      He cinches her waist, pushes in her ass.

                   What kind of doctor do you want to
                   be?

                                 PATRICK
                   Pediatrics. I like kids.         Come
                   on, stay with me. You're
                   slackin'.

                                 SARA
                   Do you have any? Kids.

                                    PATRICK
                   No.   Do you?

                                 SARA
                   I wasn't being smart, Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                   Wouldn't be the first time.

      She stops.     Regards him.      He stops.    Regards her.
      Stalemate.

                                     SARA
                   Screw you.      I'm brilliant.

      He goes into a spin, a half-split, comes out of it
      swaggering and half-stepping around her. Sara gives him
      an impish look. Rises up on full pointe, turns out her
      legs and lifts one of them in a spiral just below his
      head. It happens in two blinks. So fast Patrick thinks
      it was a mirage. He stares at her, dumbfounded. Sara
      smiles. The look on his face is worth the pain in her
      joints. She blows some stray hair out of her face, puts
      her hands on her hips. Looks appropriately hapless.

                                 SARA
                   I didn't get it. That thing you
                   just did. Show me again?

                                 PATRICK
                   What was that shit you just did?

      He mimes the move -- badly.        Sara can't help it.       She
      laughs.

                                   SARA
                   A releve.    Over ice.     With a

                Uh-huh. Used to as in don't any
                more. And don't ask me why.

      She sounds suddenly defensive.       Patrick's suddenly
      intrigued.

                                PATRICK

                it.

                              PATRICK
                That's why you brought it up. Did
                that whole relieve thing. 'Cause
                you don't wanna talk about it?

                              SARA
                Because it's not a big deal.       Can
                we just concentrate on this?

                              PATRICK
                Yeah, we can concentrate.
                       (a beat; goading her
                        a little)
                But I think it is a big deal.
                Whatever it is you don't wanna
                talk about.

      Sara shakes her head adamantly. He nods his head
      emphatically. Another stalemate. They dance coyly,
      seductively around it.

      Patrick enters to hear CHRISTOPHER SCREAMING his lungs
      out. He passes down the hall to Chenille's room to find
      Christopher squirming in Kenny's arms. Kenny doesn't
      know what to do.

      Patrick takes Christopher, holds him and consoles him
      until he settles down. Patrick pointedly hands the baby
      to Chenille, glares accusingly at her and Kenny as he
      quits the room. Kenny regards his son haplessly. Looks

112   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GIRLS' LAVATORY - MORNING                  112

      Dripping, out-of-order faucets, graffiti-laced stalls,
      litter-strewn floors are underscored by the spooky
      flicker of fluorescent lights. Sara walks in. The
      bathroom appears to be empty. She's about to enter a
      stall when she hears the murmur of a voice. A guy's
      voice. Then a girl's whimper. She eases forward a bit.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                   I don't get paid 'til next week.

                                 MALE (O.S.)
                   Boo the fuck hoo. You can't put
                   my bizness up your nose on no
                   layaway plan. C'mon now. You
                   know what you gotta do.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                 66.

112   CONTINUED:                                                       112

      Sara ventures carefully forward to the edge of the
      stall's open door. She cranes her neck trying to see
      without being sen.


      HER POV - STALL

      A GIRL is seated on the toilet. A man straddles her, his
      crotch in her face. The Girl sees Sara. Something in
      her face gives this away. The "man" glances out past his
      shoulder. He looks right down our throat straight into
      Sara's eyes. Malakai.


      ON SARA

                                 SARA
                   What are you doing?

      Malakai backs up. The Girl jumps up, runs out the
      lavatory. Malakai zips up his pants. Sara's frozen,
      staring at him.

                                 MALAKAI
                   You didn't see nothin', you don't
                   say nothin'. Not unless you want
                   a taste for yourself. And that
                   can be arranged.

      He leaves.     Sara waits a moment.   Exits.


113   HALLWAY                                                          113

      She sees Mr. Hill, starts to move for him. Someone grabs
      her arm from behind. She turns, startled, a little
      afraid. It's the Girl from the stall. She looks Sara in
      the eye. Shakes her head. Don't. Mr. Hill walks by
      them unbeckoned.


114   EXT. INNER HARBOR (DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE) - PARK - DAY              114

      A perfect day. CAMERA PANS FROM the waterfront TO the
      bustling crowds of the inner harbor, then to a park
      across from this where Sara and Patrick are practicing.
      HIP-HOP MUSIC softly PLAYS from Patrick's BOOM-BOX. Sara
      watches his face as they dance.

                                 PATRICK
                   Didn't you like it when you 'used'
                   to dance?

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 SARA
                   Yeah I liked it. I was gonna go
                   to Juilliard. That school fucked
                   up my entire life. It's a long
                   story.

                                  PATRICK
                   Let me guess. You don't wanna
                   talk about it.

      Sara looks at him.     A soft smile is all she offers up.


115   EXT. PARK - SARA AND PATRICK - LATER                            115

      They lay on their bellies in the grass.       Close to each
      other.

                                 PATRICK
                   I stole a bike here once.

                                 SARA
                   Why'd you do that?

                                 PATRICK
                   'Cause I didn't have one.

                                 SARA
                   That's a good reason.

                                 PATRICK
                   I used to do wild shit like that.

                                 SARA
                   You and Malakai?

                                  PATRICK
                   Yep.   Most of the time.

                                 SARA
                   I don't get you guys.    You seem
                   so... different.

                                  PATRICK
                   We're not.

                                 SARA
                   Maybe you weren't then but you are
                   now. You said you changed.

                                 PATRICK
                   Doesn't make me different from
                   him. Not the way you think it
                   does.

                                 SARA
                   I think Malakai's scary.   And I
                   know you're not.

                                 PATRICK
                          (taking mild umbrage)
                   What you mean by scary? 'Kai's
                   tough. He has to be. He still
                   got a good heart. I know.

      Sara stares at the ground, struggling to tell him what
      she saw.

                                 SARA
                   Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                   Let me finish. Me and him got
                   into some shit awhile back. Real
                   bad shit. We held up a gas
                   station off 95. I bailed the ride
                   -- jumped out the car. 'Kai kept
                   goin', got caught.
                          (pauses)
                   I knew what he was gonna do that
                   night. Knew the car was hot. I
                   woulda been guilty as him if they
                   had caught me, if Malakai had
                   served my name up. But he didn't.

                                 SARA
                   That means you owe him something?

                                 PATRICK
                   He did his time plus most of mine.
                   I owe him that.

                                 SARA
                   No matter how much he messes up?

                              PATRICK
                We all mess up. Maybe Malakai
                gave up. But he's still m'boy and
                he still got a chance. I ain't
                just gonna cross him completely
                off and be like everybody else.

      He looks at her and she doesn't have the heart -- or the
      nerve -- to tell him. A long moment. She plucks a
      dandelion from the grass, twirls it thoughtfully in her
      fingers.

                   I stole a hat once. When I was
                   twelve. My mom found it under my
                   mattress, made me take it back.

      his nose.

                   There's nothing to say.

                   Know why there's nothing to say?
                   Because you don't talk about her.
                   You won't talk about her.

      She looks at him. Patrick grins. Sara knocks her legs
      against his. He knocks his legs back. A silly moment.
      But it transcends the tension and creates a sweet truce
      between them.


116   INT. PATRICK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           116

      Momma Dean's fixing dinner. Patrick enters with the mail
      in his teeth, a load of books in his arms. He dumps the
      books on the counter, busses Momma Dean's check on the
      way to the 'fridge.

                                 MOMMA DEAN
                   I know you're not puttin' those
                   dirty hands inside my
                   refrigerator.

      Patrick  backs up to the sink. Washes his hands.
      Impishly  dries them on her apron. He sits, begins
      sifting  through the mail. Momma Dean pulls an envelope
      from her  pocket. Waves it at him.

                                 MOMMA DEAN
                   This what you're lookin' for?

      Chenille appears in the doorway. Patrick takes the
      letter. He's almost afraid to open it. But he does.
      And as he reads the letter, a slyly relieved smile
      spreads across his face. He tosses the letter in the
      air. Grabs Chenille and Momma Dean. And the three of
      them jump up and down together with joy.


117   INT./EXT. CITY BUS (MOVING) - SARA AND PATRICK - NIGHT           117

      Dressed to the nines. They look happy and relaxed, more
      so than we've ever seen. They sit close to each other.
      Very close.

                   Are you gonna tell me where we're

                   You're the one with something to

      She looks at him. Can't find any words. So she just
      goes into her evening bag and pulls out a small box. She
      hands it to him, a little nervous about how it will be
      received.

                             SARA
               I wanted to get you something and
               I couldn't figure out what. It's
               not much but I hope you like it.

      Patrick opens the box. Removes a key chain. It's
      engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc.).
      He regards her, touched.

                                  PATRICK
                   I like it.   I love it.    Thank you.

                                 SARA
                Wait.     There's more.

      She leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand. The
      back side of it is engraved with the words, "PATRICK
      REYNOLDS, M.D." Patrick locks eyes with Sara, lifts her
      hand to his lips. Kisses it softly. The gesture is
      succinct but alluring and, for a brief moment, they're
      the only two people in the world.


118   INT./EXT. CITY BUS - SARA AND PATRICK - LATER                      118

      The bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on.
      Sits across from Sara and Patrick who have moved even
      closer to each other. Patrick's arm is around Sara's
      shoulder. He whispers something in Sara's ear. She
      laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at
      them with a muted but obvious repugnance. Watching the
      woman from the corner of her eye, Sara drapes her arms
      around Patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. Patrick's
      eyes widen. Sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds
      one of her legs between his and whispers:

                                 SARA
                   We have an audience.      Work with

      He grabs her ass   -- what else is there? -- runs his hand
      along her side.    The white woman, thoroughly disgusted,
      gets up and moves   to the back of the bus. Patrick and
      Sara look at each   other, burst out laughing.


119   EXT. BALTIMORE HALL - NIGHT                                  119

      The equivalent of D.C.'s Kennedy Center, the hall is
      awash in lights and activity. Men and women are donned
      in formal attire. Parking valets hover on the sidewalks
      waiting for cars. Into this, Sara and Patrick walk. She
      looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner --
      "Boston Ballet, A Command Performance." Sara's heart
      stops. Her feet freeze. Patrick looks at her. She
      looks positively catatonic.

                                 PATRICK
                   Surprise... Sara?

                                 SARA
                          (quietly urgent)
                   I can't. I can't go in.

                                 PATRICK
                          (doesn't understand)
                   You have to go in. This is where
                   I'm bringing you. The ballet.

                                  SARA
                          (beside herself)
                   I know, but --

                             PATRICK
                      (crestfallen)
               But what?

      Sara looks at him, feeling bad. Feeling stupid for
      ruining the evening. She bites her lip, shakes her head
      ("but nothing"). Patrick takes her and they go in.


120   INT. BALTIMORE HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                     120

      Sara and Patrick watch the Boston Company perform Igor
      Stravinsky's "Scenes De Ballet" as choreographed by
      Christopher Wheeldon. They're both enraptured. But
      while Patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of Sara,
      her eyes remain fixed on the dancers, the dance. She is
      utterly, totally engaged and amazed. The yearning that
      never really left her returns to tug at her heart and
      project her soul onto the stage.

                                                              73.

121   EXT. STREET (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                   121

      Post-ballet, Sara and Patrick walk. She's quiet,
      introspective. Patrick's at a loss. He can't decipher
      her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it.

                              PATRICK
                I thought you would like it.

                              SARA
                I did.

                              PATRICK
                You ain't actin' like you did.

      She looks over at him, tries to smile.

                              SARA
                I'm sorry.

      They come to a small, secluded bridge.     Sara sits down on
      the edge of it. Patrick follows suit.      A long moment.

                              SARA
                I don't want you to think I didn't
                have a good time tonight, Patrick.
                I did. But ballet isn't a part of
                my life anymore.

                              PATRICK
                Why not? What happened? You just
                woke up one day and decided to
                waste your talent.

                              SARA
                       (without rancor)
                How do you know I have talent?
                Because I did some stupid leg
                trick.

                              PATRICK
                I saw the look on your face when
                you did it, Sara. The same look I
                saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if
                you're gonna tell me somethin'
                about not dancing, at least tell
                me somethin' real.

      A long, difficult moment wherein Sara attempts to find
      the words, face the pain that comes with them. Finally,
      she looks at him.

                              SARA
                Maybe I don't want it to be real.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              74.

121   CONTINUED:                                                    121

      She stares out at the water, the moon reflected off of
      it. It's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil
      she's feeling. But she goes on.

                              SARA
                What I want is to wake up and see
                my mom. For things to go back to
                the way they were. When they made
                sense. When my life made sense.
                       (because)
                And it's all my fault. She got
                scraped off the highway for me,
                for my fucking audition. She was
                rushing. It was raining. It was
                raining...
                       (a torrent)
                ... But she promised to be there.
                I made her promise. And then I
                didn't wait for her. I should
                have but they called my name and I
                didn't say anything. I just went
                out and danced. I was mad. I
                needed her and she wasn't there.

      She buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked
      with tears and guilt. Patrick puts his arms around her.

                              SARA
                       (inconsolable)
                She was dying while I was dancing
                and I was mad at her and I'm
                sorry. I'm sorry...

                              PATRICK
                It's not your fault it rained or
                she died. Or that you danced.
                That's what you were there for.
                Your mom would've expected you to
                do what you did.

      Sara, choking on tears, regards him forlornly.

                              SARA
                That's what makes it so bad. She
                always did what was right for me.
                I wanted to be a prima ballerina
                -- had to be. Even if it took
                most of our money, all of her
                spare time. I didn't care. It
                was my stupid dream and it killed
                her. All she wanted was for it to
                come true.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           75.

121   CONTINUED:                                                  121

                                 PATRICK
                   You still got whatever you had
                   when your mom was alive, Sara.
                   She wouldn't want you to give up.

      Sara swipes at her face, looks up at him, still crying.

                                 SARA
                   I know... but she... I just don't
                   think I can do it without her.

                                 PATRICK
                          (holding her)
                   Do you want to do it, Sara? I
                   mean you. Do you want Juilliard?

                                   SARA
                   Yeah.   I do.

                                 PATRICK
                   Then it's on you to make the dream
                   come true.

                                  SARA
                   Yeah.   For my mom.

                                  PATRICK
                   For her.   For you.


122   EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT/STREET - THAT NIGHT                    122

      Patrick walks Sara to the front door. They pause on the
      stoop. Neither of them wants the night to end.

                                 SARA
                   See you tomorrow?

      A rhetorical question under the circumstances. Patrick
      regards her tenderly, moves her hair from her eyes.
      Stares deeply into them. Sara smiles wanly, certain she
      looks like shit. But it doesn't matter. The moment has
      named itself. And so, with more certainty than passion,
      they kiss.


123   INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                    123

      CAMERA PANS the room, PICKING UP small touches from
      Sara's past life, her previous bedroom -- more on display
      than we've seen before. HOLD ON closet door. A beat
      before Sara emerges from behind it, ballet slippers in
      hand. She takes a deep breath. Slides them on. Peers
      down at her feet. Wiggles them. Nothing magical or
      mystical but simply wonderful. Gleefully wonderful.
      Like the end of a long day's journey to home.

                                                               76.

124   EXT. INNER HARBOR COMPLEX   (DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE) - DAY         124

      Sara and Patrick negotiate the heavy pedestrian traffic,
      exit the complex. He leads her to a mall of trees and
      bike paths.

                              PATRICK
               Lemme see that move you did.     That
               cute leg relieve thing.
                      (as she shakes
                       her head)
               Come on, Sara.

                             SARA
                      (hates to admit this)
               It hurts! I'm out of shape and it
               hurts. Okay? Satisfied?

                              PATRICK
                       (admiring her)
                That's what you call outta shape,
                what's it take to get you in
                shape?

                                SARA
                Practice.

                              PATRICK
                This is the perfect spot for that.
                You can run around and I can sit
                under the trees and watch you.

                              SARA
                I don't get in shape like that.
                But it's still a good spot.
                       (diffidently)
                I got my application for
                Juilliard. Just in time too.
                They're holding auditions in
                Baltimore next month.

                                PATRICK
                That's great!

      She looks at him, shakes her head.   Not that great.

                              SARA
                I'll never be ready in a month.

                              PATRICK
                Sara, you puttin' the mojo on
                yourself.

                           (a smile in spite of
                            herself)
                   Mojo?

                              PATRICK
                Negative shit. White folks call
                it karma. The bad kind.

                              SARA
                You don't understand. Ballet
                takes a lot of time, a lot of
                preparation. I used to practice
                two, three hours every day. I'm
                so far behind...

      ... And unsure and afraid. Which Patrick can sense.        But
      he won't let her go there or stay there. He's firm,
      matter-of-fact.

                              PATRICK
                Quit whinin' and catch up then.

                              SARA
                It's not as easy as that. My free
                form still sucks. It's still the
                weakest part of my routine. That
                hasn't changed.

                                 PATRICK
                   So I'll help you with it.

                                  SARA
                   You will?

                          (surprised that she's
                           surprised)
                   Yeah. I'll help you. Tell me
                   what you need to do and let's get
                   busy.

      Sara in the mirror dressed in leotards and tights.       She
      bends forward from the hip, extends a leg, a
      corresponding arm.

      As she tries to complete the arabesque, the backward-most
      leg buckles. She steadies herself. Starts over.

      SARA - IN VARIOUS STAGES OF GETTING BUSY

      MONTAGE ENDS.


132   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA                              132

      OPEN CLOSE ON a black hand shaking a white one. PULL
      BACK to reveal Patrick and Roy. Sara enters looking
      striking, pretty, very down. Chenille's influence is
      written all over her makeup and her clothes. Overlooking
      Roy, she blithely tags Patrick.

                                 SARA
                   Let's skip.
                          (cursory, to Roy)
                   Later.

      They leave. Roy stands in the middle of the room,
      dumbfounded.

                   Let's 'skip'?
                          (mumbling to
                           himself)
                   Three months and she's skipping?


133   INT. FEETZ - BAR - NIGHT                                       133

      Usual suspects, usual music. Patrick hands Sara a call-
      brand beer. Leans in with his drink, openly and
      contently with her.


      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Nikki and her crew (Jasmin, Tiff'nee, Alyssa). Nikki
      hasn't seen Patrick and Sara. She's showing her crew a
      dance.


      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Chenille, Diggy and another black girl.     Fraternizing.


      ANOTHER ANGLE - DEEJAY BOOTH

      A chrome-domed deejay with a Barry White baritone bellows
      into his mike as he changes the music.

                              DEEJAY
                Master P with the 'Ghetto D'.
                Showmesomethin', showmesomethin',
                give up that cruel. Eyes on you!

      WIDER as the dance floor swells with kids. PICK UP Sara
      and Patrick among them. She looks at him nervously. He
      smiles.

                              PATRICK
                Nobody's watchin' you but me.

      A gallant lie. Sara tries    to believe it. They dance.
      Practice has made her near   perfect. Their movements are
      ambitious, nimble, better   than anyone else on the floor.
      They move so well together   that Snookie, dancing nearby,
      starts chanting:

                                SNOOKIE
                Go, Patrick!    Go, Patrick!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

      FROM ANOTHER ANGLE OF DANCE FLOOR

      Diggy.     Jiggling and wildly gyrating.   Chiming in --

                                  DIGGY
                   Go, Sara!   Go, Sara!


      PATRICK AND SARA

      building up a sweat; confidently dancing at fever pitch.

                                DEEJAY (V.O.)
                  Everybody have funk, funk, funk!


134   INT. FEETZ - DANCE FLOOR                                         134

      Sara and Patrick, still going at it. Snookie, Diggy and
      others prance around them like backup dancers.


      ANOTHER ANGLE - NIKKI

      standing with her crew dourly observing Patrick and Sara.

                                NIKKI
                  Watch me squash their shit.    Hard.


      ON NIKKI

      Shoving, pushing, and barging her way up to Patrick.
      Without preamble or regard for Sara, she starts dancing
      with him. Patrick looks at Sara but he's somehow dancing
      with Nikki. Sara retreats with daggers in her eyes.
      Pissed.


      PATRICK (AND NIKKI)

      unresponsive as she grinds her body into his, raw and
      wild.


      SARA

      standing where she can see but can't be seen from the
      dance floor. From a curtain of kids, Malakai suddenly
      appears at her side. Sara can't move. She's boxed in.
      Malakai indicates Nikki and Patrick with slick
      satisfaction, whispers derisively:

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                81.

134   CONTINUED:                                                      134

                                  MALAKAI
                   You ain't never gonna look as good
                   as she does with him. That's oil.
                   You're milk. Ain't no point in
                   tryin' to mix.

      He evaporates into the crowd.        Sara stands there.


      PATRICK AND NIKKI

      as a SLOW DANCE BEGINS. Nikki starts to press herself
      against Patrick. Patrick holds her off with both arms.
      Walks away.


      WIDER ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR - FAVOR PATRICK

      moving toward Sara.

      A stark, apologetic expression on his face. He takes her
      hand. Sara fiercely jerks away. Patrick grabs her hand
      again, more emphatically this time. But Sara won't budge
      from the spot where she's standing. So Patrick slides
      his arms around her, holds her without moving. They
      remain like this for a moment or two until they slowly
      begin to dance. We PUSH IN ON them in this little space.
      Patrick's lips brush Sara's ear.

                                 PATRICK
                   Sara...?

                                 SARA
                   What?

                                 PATRICK
                I'm sorry.


      ANGLE PAST THEM ON MALAKAI

      slow dancing with his flavor of the night. Eyes on Sara
      and Patrick. Both underwhelmed and resentful of what he
      sees.


135   INT. ROY'S ROWHOUSE - HALLWAY/FRONT DOOR - THAT NIGHT           135

      Sara unlocks the door. She and Patrick enter. She turns
      on the lights. Looks at him. Answers the unspoken
      question.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                   82.

135   CONTINUED:                                                         135

                                 SARA
                   He's in D.C. Blues Alley.   He'll
                   be gone all night.

      Patrick sits down on the sofa. Sara crosses to the
      STEREO, turns it ON. A SAX SOLO begins playing.

                                SARA
                   Roy's demo. The only one he ever
                   cut. Kinda grows on you.

      A beat.   Somewhere between five seconds and forever.
      Then:

                                 SARA
                   Wanna see my room?

      Patrick looks at her, nods. He gets up, follows Sara
      behind the partition into her "room." They stand there
      for a moment. He cups her face with his hands. Kisses
      her. They begin to take off each other's clothes,
      alternately sure and fumbling; a bit awkward, a bit
      urgent. Sara unzips Patrick's pants, catches something
      other than his clothes. Patrick winces in pain. She
      looks at him with an embarrassed grimace. Says this very
      low.

                                 SARA
                   Sorry...

      They kiss again, stumble backward to her futon.       Fall
      down upon it and begin to make love.


136   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - PATRICK AND SARA -                 136
      DAY

      CAMERA TRACKS them as they walk down the hall hand-in-
      hand, sometimes exchanging greetings with other students.
      They are officially a couple and they appear to be in
      love. At the door to Sara's next class, Patrick busses
      her lips before she enters.


137   INT. SARA'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION                          137

      No teacher is present. The class files in. Toni drops
      down in a chair beside Sara. She leans over in a
      conspiratorial whisper.

                                 TONI
                   Whatever you do, don't fuck him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                  SARA
                   Excuse me?

                                 TONI
                   'Hit it and quit it,' that's their
                   motto.

                                   SARA
                   Whose motto?

                                   TONI
                   Black guys.    Everybody knows that.

      The teacher walks in.       Sara quickly whispers back to
      Toni.

                                 SARA
                   Don't forget, they all have big
                   dicks and beat their wives.
                   Everybody knows that too.


138   INT. RIB JOINT (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                   138


      Malakai, along with Snookie and two brain donors, ARVEL
      and LIP, eat at a booth. Patrick strolls in gritty from
      work. Tired from work. He slides in next to Malakai.
      The mood is light, jovial.

                                 ARVEL
                   You smell, boy.

                                 PATRICK
                   How can a piece of shit tell?

      The table cracks up.

                                 MALAKAI
                   You been scarce lately, man.
                   Where you been?

                                 ARVEL
                   Somewhere dreamin' of a White
                   Christmas...

                                 LIP
                   ... And Christmas ain't even for
                   'nother six months.

                                 SNOOKIE
                   Lip. It's a so-to-speak thang,

                   So.   So to speak? Whassup.

                                 PATRICK
                          (snatching up one of
                           his ribs)
                   Back out my business, boy.

                                 MALAKAI
                          (watching Patrick
                           keenly)
                   You tappin' that white girl, man?
                          (half joking)
                   That's why you ain't got time for
                   your boyz no more, you too busy
                   frontin'. Too busy snowflakin'.

      Patrick lifts one of Malakai's ribs, responds coolly.

                              PATRICK
                How am I frontin', 'Kai? I made
                time for this bullshit, didn't I?

                              LIP
                Aww, man. You busted. That's why
                your jaws are gettin' so tight.

                              SNOOKIE
                You the one need his jaws
                tightened with your pork-ass
                instigatin' self.

                       (re: Patrick's roving
                        fingers)
                Order somethin', Patrick. This
                ain't no goddamn soup line.

      Patrick grabs some of Arvel's fries, chews them in his
      face.

                                 PATRICK

                   I ain't messin' with those fools
                   over there. You know how they
                   are.

                                 MALAKAI
                   I ain't pressed. I got my own
                   shit.

      Shorthand. The table stops. Malakai glances around,
      lifts his shirt to expose a gun. Patrick stares at
      Malakai with disbelief.

                             MALAKAI
               What you think? I'ma keep walkin'
               around waitin' for some chump to
               cap me? I'ma protect myself.

                             PATRICK
               That ain't protection. It's an
               excuse for some unnecessary
               mayhem.

                             MALAKAI
               Ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout
               it. Shit. Mayhem and madness.
               That's a black man's life.

                             PATRICK
               How you know? You ain't tried
               nothing else. Now you sittin' up
               here strapped for no good reason.
               You askin' for trouble, Malakai.
                      (as Malakai laughs)
               You think this shit's funny?

      Snookie shifts uncomfortably. Arvel and Lip look at
      Malakai. Malakai looks at Patrick, coldly drops his
      smile.

                                 MALAKAI
                   I think it's funny you think it
                   ain't necessary. You act like you
                   don't know where you are no more,
                   Patrick, and whassup out there for
                   anybody who ain't you. Maybe
                   that's what happens when a white
                   girl goes to your head.

                          (looks at Malakai)
                   I know what's out there. I also
                   know you can get past it. But
                   that ain't gonna happen, 'Kai,
                   long as you keep gettin' in your
                   own way.

                                 ARVEL
                          (peacemaker)
                   Aw'ight. Y'all said what you had
                   to say. We back to bein' boyz.
                   Patrick. Chill. Have some ribs.


139   INT. ROY'S ROWHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                          139

      Sara and Patrick, post-coital. She's in her robe. He's
      dressed but they're fooling around as they fix
      sandwiches. Patrick drops down in a chair. Sara drops
      down on his lap.

                                 PATRICK
                   What's your favorite flower?

                                 SARA
                   I don't have a favorite.

                                 PATRICK
                   Yeah, but if you did...

                                 SARA
                   I dunno. Maybe cymbidiums --
                   orchids. They're sort of show-
                   boaty but they're pretty.

                                 PATRICK
                   What's your favorite color?

                                    SARA
                   Agua.

                                 PATRICK
                   What's your second favorite color?

                                    SARA
                   Mmm.    Mauve.

                                 PATRICK
                   You're makin' this real hard,
                   Sara. Those ain't exactly tuxedo
                   colors.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                  87.

139   CONTINUED:                                                        139

      Sara swings her legs around, facing him, straddling him.

                                  SARA
                   Nut.   What are you talking about?

                                 PATRICK
                   I was tryin' to get around to
                   askin' you somethin' but since I'm
                   some sorta nut, you probably
                   wouldn't wanna go to prom with
                   me...

      She throws her arms around his neck, kissing him.
      Patrick slides his hands under her robe, cups her
      breasts. Sara responds to him. They are too engrossed
      in this intimacy to hear the FRONT DOOR OPENING, to see
      Roy until he walks in and sees them. Sara leaps up,
      closes her robe. Patrick doesn't know what to do. He's
      caught. Straight up. Red-handed. Roy's eyes dart
      between them, settle on and slice into Patrick.

                                 ROY
                   Patrick -- it is Patrick, isn't
                   it?
                          (a small awkward nod)
                   Well, I think you were just
                   leavin'.

      Patrick stands up.      Sara grabs his arm defiantly, holds
      him back.

                                 SARA
                   Why does he have to leave?   We're
                   all adults. Right?

                                 ROY
                   He either leaves or I throw his
                   ass out. Your call, Sara.

      Patrick jerks his arm free from Sara, grabs his jacket
      off the back of his chair. He back-talks Roy as he
      passes him.

                                 PATRICK
                   Chill, man. I'm goin'. You don't
                   have to come off with all 'at.

                             ROY
               Who the hell are you to tell
               me how to come off? You're in my
               house alone with my daughter.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               88.

      It takes everything Patrick has to keep walking until
      he's out the door. It slams behind him. Sara marches up
      to Roy, furious.

                              SARA
                I hate being your daughter.    You
                ruin everything.

      She tries to stomp off.    Roy kicks a chair in her path.
      Snarls.

                              ROY
               Siddown.
                      (not a request; an
                        order; as she sits)
               It's a free country, you can hate
               me. Ain't like that's exactly
               news. But disrespectin' me,
               that's where the road ends, Sara.
               I don't want him up here again. I
               mean it.

                             SARA
               You mean it because he's black.

                             ROY
               Don't start that bullshit!

                             SARA
               Why's it bullshit? Because you
               hang with black guys and play jazz
               and have the hots for Angela
               Bassett?

                             ROY
               Because he was in my house with
               his hands all over my daughter!

                              SARA
                Keep telling yourself that. Just
                don't expect me to believe it. I
                saw how you looked at him. But
                you didn't see him. Well, for
                your information, he's a straight-
                A student with more heart and guts
                than you'll ever have!

                                 ROY
                   Yeah? Well, when are you gonna
                   have the guts to say what you
                   really want to say to me, Sara?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               89.

                                 SARA
                          (screaming at him)
                   Want me to say it? You were a
                   piece of shit husband and you're a
                   piece of shit father! You were
                   never there for Mom or for me.
                   You took off and never looked
                   back. So don't talk to me about
                   guts.

      Not quite the truth, but near enough to sting. It quiets
      Roy down. He regards her with regret and guilt.

                                 ROY
                   Sounds like you have it all
                   figured out.

                             SARA
               I have you figured out. You think
               you can make up all the time you
               missed, all the things you didn't
               do? You can't! I'm here because
               I have to be and it's a goddamned
               nightmare.

                             ROY
               Well, you might as well wake up
               and get used to it, Sara, because
               that's the way things are
               sometimes, the way life is.

                             SARA
               How the hell would you know?
               You've been asleep for the past
               thirty-seven years!

      Now she does storm off. This time Roy lets her.     He
      can't find the words to deny what she's said.


140   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - QUAD OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY             140

      A break between classes draws the requisite claques and
      cliques. Sara and Patrick huddle over a chemistry book,
      attentive to each other. Nikki stands off watching both
      of them. Malakai saunters up to her smoking a joint.
      Hazily indicates Patrick and Sara.

                   though, Nikki. You lettin' some
                   white ho' show you up like that.

      He regards her with bemused pity. Nikki, with all her
      inner outrage, manages to salvage her pride. She sneers
      in his face.

                                 NIKKI
                   Fuck you, Malakai. Fuck her too.

      Patrick drinks at a water fountain. Looks up. Malakai's
      standing there. There's still some tension between them.

                                 MALAKAI

      They walk off together and, after a few steps, begin
      dribbling imaginary balls down the hall.


142   INT. GYM (PATTERSON) - DAY                                   142

      A girls' basketball game in progress. Sara's playing
      defense. She's on Nikki's team. She blocks a shot but
      Chenille, on the opposing team, gets it on the rebound.
      Basket. Nikki shoots Sara a murderous look. Stupid,

      unseen BOOM BOX BLASTS the music of JAY-Z throughout.
      Patrick has the ball. He passes it to Malakai. They AD-

144   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GYM                                    144

      Sara takes her defensive position against an opposing
      player, successfully blocks the shot, tries to slam the
      ball to Nikki. It clips Nikki's head, bounces out of
      bounds. Nikki, her dignity stunned, her patience out,
      walks up to Sara, shoves her to the floor. Sara looks up
      at her as some disembodied voice calls out:

                              FEMALE VOICE
                Don't start nothin', won't be
                nothin'! Stay down, girl!


145   EXT. DRUID HILL - BASKETBALL COURT                           145

      Malakai dribbles the ball around one of the Two Deuces,
      skies it. Misses the hoop. Patrick rebounds. Passes it
      back to 'Kai. He takes the shot. Makes it. Patrick and
      Arvel strut victoriously.


146   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GYM                                    146

      Sara jumps up, shoves Nikki back.    And the fight is on.

147   EXT. DRUID HILL - BASKETBALL COURT                            147

      As the dejected Deuces look on, Malakai high-fives
      Patrick and Snookie. Arvel's moving into their circle
      when SHOTS RING OUT. Everybody on the court instantly
      dives to the ground for cover.


148   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GYM                                     148

      Sara and Nikki tumble to the gym floor. The surprise is
      Sara. She matches Nikki blow for blow. It's a punishing
      fight for both of them and it only ends when the gym
      teacher separates them.


149   EXT. DRUID HILL - BASKETBALL COURT                            149

      A car speeds off. Patrick raises up, looks around.
      Malakai nods. He's okay. Snookie's crawling to the
      exit, snot-nosed and crying. He's okay. Then they see
      Arvel. Sprawled on the ground. Covered in blood. He
      seems lifeless.

               Over? I don't even know why it
               started... bitch. And don't say
               it's about Patrick because it's
               not. It's not about him.

                            NIKKI
               No. It's about you. White girls
               like you. Creepin' up, takin' our
               men. The whole world ain't
               enough. You gotta conquer ours
               too.

                              SARA
                I like him, he likes me. And if
                you don't like that, screw you.

      Mrs. Gwynn walks in.   Sits down.    Looks reproachfully at
      them.

                               MRS. GWYNN
                Girls.   I think you need to talk.

                                                               93.

151   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA/SARA'S ROOM - DAY           151

      Roy's tuning his sax when Sara enters. Her face is a
      mess. Yet she drifts by, bruised and bent over, as if
      this were the norm. Roy does a double-take.

                              ROY
                What the hell happened to you?

                              SARA
                I got suspended. Two days.

      She straggles into her room.    Roy follows her to the
      futon.

                              ROY
                For what? Fighting?
                       (as she nods
                        like "no shit
                        Sherlock")
                Why were you fighting, Sara?

                              SARA
                       (sardonically)
                I'm not sure. I think it's some
                kind of black female thing.

      He sis down beside her, instinctively reaches out to
      touch her face, assess the damage. Sara sharply flinches
      away. But Roy persists and after a moment, she lets him
      minister to her.


152   INT. REYNOLDS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING                   152

      Patrick walks in, Arvel's dried blood stained into his
      clothes. Chenille's cooking with a sound-asleep
      Christopher slung over her shoulder. She and Patrick
      regard each other morosely.

                               CHENILLE
                How's Arvel?

      Patrick slumps down at the kitchen table.     He's barely
      audible.

                              PATRICK
                Pretty bad.
                       (almost to himself)
                Can't even play a got-damned game
                of ball no more.

      Chenille comes up behind him.    Squeezes, pats his
      shoulder.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                               94.

152   CONTINUED:                                                     152

                                 CHENILLE
                   You see Sara? She alright?
                          (as he looks up
                           with a question
                           mark)
                   You didn't hear? Nikki jumped off
                   at her in gym. It was fierce...

      Given the day, this is the straw on Patrick's back. He
      bolts from the table and on his way out nearly bumps
      heads with Kenny.


153   INT. ROY'S ROWHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                          153

      Patrick RINGS the DOORBELL. Sara opens the door
      slightly, just enough for Patrick to see her face.      It
      pisses him off.

                                   PATRICK
                   Shit!

                                   SARA
                   It's alright.    I'm okay.

      Roy appears in the space behind her, looking out.      Sara
      can feel his presence. Her eyes implore Patrick.

                                 SARA
                   Look.  It's not a good time.
                          (gently shutting
                           the door)
                   I'll see you later... I'm okay.


154   INT. LAUNDROMAT (SOUTHEAST BALTIMORE) - EARLY EVENING          154

      The laundromat is empty but for a few customers and
      Nikki. She's loading clothes from two large baskets into
      washers when her brother DIONDRE, 10, races in. He's
      grinning from ear-to-ear.

                              NIKKI
                Diondre, what your butt doin'
                here?

                              DIONDRE
                       (a taunting twist)
                I can go where I want. You the
                one on punishment.

      Nikki swings a wet shirt with no intention of hitting
      him. She looks up. Patrick's standing in the doorway.
      Diondre runs up to him, holds out the palm of his hand.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               95.

154   CONTINUED:                                                     154

                                   DIONDRE
                   There she go.    Gimme my two
                   dollars.

      Patrick pays him. Diondre darts out. Patrick walks up
      to Nikki. Nikki clenches, tries to dismiss him with a
      backhanded wave.

                                 NIKKI
                   Whatever it is, I don't wanna hear
                   it.

      Patrick leans up against a washing machine and for a long
      moment just looks at her. The walk there has composed
      his emotions.

                                 PATRICK
                   I thought you had somethin' to say
                   to me.

                                 NIKKI
                   You thought wrong.

      An old black woman is avidly, openly watchin' them.
      Patrick indicates a bench on the other side of the
      laundromat. Nikki petulantly follows him there. They
      sit. Patrick looks at her.

                             PATRICK
               Somethin' must be on your mind for
               you to get up in Sara's face,
               start all this drama. What you
               tryin' to prove, Nikki?

                                 NIKKI
                   You're the one tryin' to prove
                   something. Stuck up in her shit
                   like she's somethin' special.

                                 PATRICK
                   What if she is? What's it to you?
                   You didn't see me trippin' off
                   that Howard dude and I could have.
                   I coulda tripped hard, Nikki.

                                 NIKKI
                   That was different.

                                 PATRICK
                   How you gonna call it different?

      She stands up.     Looks down at him.    Raises her voice.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                             NIKKI
               Because she's white and he ain't.
               And don't sit there like you don't
               know what I'm talkin' about,
               Patrick.

                             PATRICK
                      (glaring at her)
               You don't even know what you're
               talkin' about, Nikki.

                                    NIKKI
                   I don't?     Y'all black men, soon as
                   you even    think about goin'
                   someplace    good, first thing you do
                   is find a    white girl to take with
                   you.

                                   OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                   Uh-huh.

      Patrick glares in the Old Woman's direction, then back at
      Nikki.

                                 PATRICK
                   I thought I was goin' someplace
                   good with you. You the one called
                   me off. But you ain't tryin' to
                   remember that. Now you mad. Why?
                   Because she's white and I like
                   her? I'm with her.

                                NIKKI
                   Please. You're with her because
                   she's white. That's what sets me
                   off.

                                 PATRICK
                          (exasperated)
                   It ain't got no business settin'
                   you off! Me and her ain't got
                   nothin' to do with you and what
                   you think. So keep your hands off
                   her and that shit to yourself.

      Nikki folds her arms across her chest, looks at him
      defiantly.

                                 NIKKI
                   I don't think it, I know it. But
                   you go ahead, deny it. That's
                   what y'all always do.

      She turns on her heels, goes back to her machine.
      Patrick rises, sees the old woman glinting at him. He
      holds her hateful stare for a moment, then walks out.

                                                                97.

155   INT. REYNOLDS' APARTMENT - CHENILLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT           155

      Chenille and Kenny.     In the middle of a contentious
      moment. He tries to     give her some money. She snatches
      it out of his hand.     Kenny looks at her. He's hurt.
      Chenille's too mad to    see it.

                                 CHENILLE
                   What? I'm supposed to get excited
                   because you decided to skate by
                   and drop a dollar on the dresser?

                                 KENNY
                   It's more than a dollar. And it's
                   all I got.
                          (beat)
                   I got laid off rom B.W.I.,
                   Chenille. I been workin' part-
                   time. Money's tight. You know
                   how you are about money. That's
                   way I haven't been coming around.

      Chenille stares at him for a long moment.       Her voice is
      low.

                                 CHENILLE
                   Money ain't got nothin' to do with
                   it, Kenny. You don't come around
                   because you don't feel like comin'
                   around. You don't want the
                   responsibility of comin' around.
                   As long as you out there and I'm
                   in here, you know your son's being
                   taken care of. You ain't got no
                   worries when it comes to him.

                                 KENNY
                   And you don't have no   feelings
                   when it comes to me.    All you do
                   is bitch and complain   about what I
                   don't do. I get sick    of that.

                                 CHENILLE
                   Be sick of it. You ain't got to
                   see me to see your son.

                                 KENNY
                   I'll be sure to keep that in mind.

      He leaves.    Chenille stands there, mad at him.    Mad at
      herself.

      The room is filled with young women, most them black, and
      children of all ages. They are piled up like cars on a
      freeway, waiting to be seen. The noise level is at a
      peak when Chenille and Sara walk in. Chenille's carrying
      a fussy Christopher, his diaper bag and her backpack.
      Sara, wanting to be helpful, reaches for Christopher.

                                 SARA
                   Want me to take him?

      Chenille shakes her head. Walks to reception to sign
      herself in. Sara takes in the faces of girls younger
      than herself, the grime and gloom of the room. It's
      incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children
      are brought to get well. Chenille finishes at the desk.
      Returns to Sara. They cross to a corner of the clinic
      where they sit -- on the floor. Chenille indicates the
      receptionist bitterly.

                                 CHENILLE
                   That wench. You gotta stand over
                   her to make sure she puts your
                   name on the damn list. Triflin'
                   bitch.

      Chenille starts to change Christopher's diaper. He
      starts to wail and flail. Chenille can't placate him.
      One of his kicks connects with Chenille's open backpack,
      sends books and papers flying. Sara can see the veins
      stand up on Chenille's neck.

                                   SARA
                   I'll get 'em.

      She does. Chenille's finally got control of Christopher
      but he's still crying. Chenille slips off his dirty
      diaper. When Sara hands her a clean one, Chenille
      regards her strangely, as if just remembering that she's
      there.

                                 CHENILLE
                   So your old man flipped about the
                   fight.
                          (with some animus)
                   Probably thinks it's all Patrick's
                   fault.

                                  SARA
                   No.   I explained about Nikki.

                                 CHENILLE
                   Right. You put it all on her.
                   None of it's on you.

                                 SARA
                   She started it, Chenille. She
                   wanted to start it. I told you
                   what she said.

      Chenille flashes a look, finishes up with Christopher.
      She picks him up, puts a bottle in his mouth. Cradles
      him.

                                 CHENILLE
                   Maybe she didn't have no business
                   gettin' in your face. But she had
                   a reason to say what she said.

      A reason?    Sara studies her, trying to fathom the remark.

                                 SARA
                   So you agree with her? You think
                   I don't belong with Patrick.

                                  CHENILLE
                   What I think don't matter. But
                   you and him act like it don't
                   bother people that you're
                   together. Like it don't hurt
                   people to see.

                                 SARA
                          (her Irish up)
                   We like each other. What is the
                   big fucking deal? It's him and
                   me. Not us and other 'people.'

      The white girl with the rose-colored reasoning. Chenille
      glares at Sara, her voice designed to snatch the blinders
      off.

                                CHENILLE
                  Black people, Sara. Black women.
                         (passionately)
                  Patrick's about somethin'. He's
                  smart. He's motivated. He's for
                  real. He ain't gonna make no
                  babies and not take care of 'em or
                  run the streets, fuck up his life.
                  He's gonna do somethin' with
                  himself. Here you come, white and
                  right, and you take one of the few
                  decent men left after jail, drugs
                  and drive-bys. That's what Nikki
                  meant about you up in our world.

      Sara sits there, stupefied.    Understanding.    Not
      understanding.

                          (pauses)
                   I thought we were friends. Guess
                   I was wrong.

      She gets up, walks out. Something in Chenille wants to
      call after her, but she's too miserable, too torn up
      inside to do it.


157   INT. FEETZ - BAR - NIGHT                                        157

      Patrick and Malakai nurse drinks. The MUSIC fails to
      move them. They have too much on their minds. Malakai
      fires up a cigarette.

                                 MALAKAI
                   So what you gonna do?

                                 PATRICK
                   How many times you gonna ask me
                   that?

                                 MALAKAI
                   It's payback time. Either you
                   down or you ain't. Either you
                   m'boy or you not. Simple as that.

      Patrick takes a long moment. The choice is simple. It's
      the decision that's complicated. He downs his drink.
      Hedges.

                                 PATRICK
                   Even if I did ride, you ain't got
                   nobody but Lip and Lip will get a
                   nigger's ass killed. Quick.

                             MALAKAI
               Eastside ain't got no firepower.
               I got some shit, man. AK-47. We
               go in, get out with one spray
               down.

      Just then Snookie and Sara walk toward them from the
      dance floor. Something in their faces unsettles Sara but
      Snookie, oblivious, dances up to the bar, snapping his
      fingers and bobbing his head.

                             SNOOKIE
               You see us, Patrick?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                 MALAKAI
                          (a storm warning)
                   You see us, man? We're rappin'.

      Snookie rebuffs him, keeps talking to Patrick...

                              SNOOKIE
                Me and Sara lit it up!      Y-e-o-w!

      ... bumps his butt against Sarah's hip, does a very
      ungainly half split. Sara and Patrick exchange smiles.
      Malakai isn't amused. He flattens Snookie's ass with the
      business end of his foot. Snookie sprawls flat on his
      face to the floor. Now Malakai's amused. Sara looks at
      Patrick. Patrick scowls at Malakai.

                                 PATRICK
                   That shit ain't funny.

                                 SNOOKIE
                          (springing up)
                   Damn right it ain't funny.

                                 MALAKAI
                   I thought you liked it down there.
                   That's your specialty, ain't it?
                   Crawling?

                              SNOOKIE
                That was a reflex action, man.
                And you just plain rude and wrong
                to bring the shit up in mixed
                company.

      Sara's not quite sure what they're alluding to but she
      doesn't want the displeasure of Malakai's company. She
      taps Patrick.

                              SARA
                I gotta get home. Ready?

      Malakai's eyes slice into her. First Snookie, now this
      bitch. Steppin' all over his conversation with Patrick.

                             MALAKAI
               No, he ain't ready. He's talkin'.
               To me. A-B conversation. Gotta
               go? C yourself the fuck home.

                              SARA
                       (a real reflex action)
                Fuck you.

      Malakai lunges for her. The move is so swift and sudden
      Patrick overturns his stool to dive between them. He
      sweeps Sara behind him, into the path of a startled

      Snookie. Stands there nose-to-nose with Malakai, staring
      him down, furious with him.

                              PATRICK
                Have you lost your motherfuckin'
                MIND, man? Huh? Have you!

      Sara, frightened and frozen, doesn't know what to do.
      Snookie's voice weakly creaks out. He's trying to rise
      to the occasion.

                             SNOOKIE
               Patrick, man, c'mon.

      But Malakai and Patrick stay where they stand. Too close
      for comfort. Both in the danger zone. Malakai regards
      Patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep,
      genuine hurt.

                             MALAKAI
               You take that bitch's back and
               won't even cover mine?

                             PATRICK
               'Cause you wrong, Malakai!

                             MALAKAI
               No! You wrong. You BEEN wrong.
               You ain't worth shit no more.
                      (venomously)
               Get out my face, and take that ho
               with you.

      Patrick bucks up. Sara walks over to him, gently
      clutches his sleeve. It's no easier to turn away from
      Malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of
      friendship. But Patrick does. With Sara holding onto
      his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away.


158   EXT. STREET - SARA AND PATRICK - NIGHT                     158

      walking. A heavy silence. Sara looks over at him.
      Patrick doesn't say anything. But after a moment, he
      reaches down and takes her hand and they walk on like
      this together.

      OVER MUSIC (e.g. BUSTA RHYMES' "Dangerous.")


159   INT. DANCE STUDIO - SARA AND PATRICK - MORNING             159

      Practice her free form, a hip-hop ballet hybrid. They're
      both tired, irritable, beaten down. They've been there
      awhile. Sara makes a misstep. Patrick stops. Cold.
      Sara grits on him.

                   We should keep going.

                                    PATRICK
                   You messed up.

                                 SARA
                   I know I messed up. I'll get it
                   right the next time.

                             PATRICK
               No. You gonna get it right now so
               you can do it perfect next time.

      She glares at him, exasperated.         So many things bottled
      up.

                                 SARA
                   I can't work like this.      I can't
                   dance like this.

                                PATRICK

                                SARA
               Like this.     You dictating to me.

      He crosses the room, CUTS OFF the MUSIC. Looks at her.
      Sara walks over to a window seat near him. Flops down.

                                 PATRICK
                   What's wrong, Sara?

                   I can't figure things out.

                   What things? The audition? You
                   ain't got nothin' to worry about.
                   I told you. I'll be there.

                                 SARA
                   Things, Patrick. Things between
                   us. Things between us and them.

                             PATRICK
               I didn't know there was a 'them.'

                   Maybe they have a point, Patrick.

                   They only got a point if you
                   believe they got a point, Sara.

      She looks at him... and loves him... and doesn't know

                   I'm just saying that we should

                   myself, run my own life, and I
                   thought you did too.

      Sara looks at him.     Now she's getting mad.

                                 SARA
                   You're never gonna run your own
                   life as long as you keep running
                   back to Malakai every time he
                   fucks up or fucks you over.

      She's crossed the line. But Patrick responds so
      deliberately, so calmly prosaic, that she doesn't
      immediately realize it...

                                 PATRICK
                   First of all, Malakai ain't never
                   fucked me over. Second of all,
                   you don't know him, Sara, what he
                   been through. Matter of fact, you
                   don't know shit about none of it.
                   So don't come off to me like you
                   do.

      ... until he erupts.

                   Who the fuck are you to say he's
                   lost? Malakai had my back when
                   you were busy gee-whizzin' in the
                   woods with your backward-ass,

                   You know what?     The hell with you.

      Sara yells after him.     Her VOICE ECHOES in the empty
      studio.

                                 SARA
                   The hell with you too!


160   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY OUTSIDE SARA'S CLASSROOM - 160
      DAY

      Sara exits, looking pretty much like she feels. Like
      shit. She walks a few paces. Sees Patrick. Their eyes
      connect for a brief, awful moment before they continue on
      their respective ways.


161   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - SARA'S LOCKER/HALLWAY -                    161
      LATER THAT DAY

      Sara's at her locker. Patrick walks up to her. She
      looks at him, tries to smile past the dour expression on
      his face.

                                    SARA
                   Hi.

      Patrick doesn't say anything at first.       But then:

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                            106.

161   CONTINUED:                                                    161

                                 PATRICK
                   Thought you might need this on
                   Saturday. I ain't gonna be able
                   to make it.

      He hands her an audio cassette of her free form music.
      Sara gazes at it, then up at him, understanding what this
      means. She won't let him see how it shatters her. He
      hesitates, as if he wants to say something else. But
      Sara turns her back on him and Patrick walks away.


      ANOTHER ANGLE - TONI

      approaching Sara's locker. Having seen the encounter
      between Patrick and Sara, she's as smug and overbearing
      as ever.

                                 TONI
                   Lovers' quarrel? You're better
                   off. That menace to society
                   would've broken your heart and
                   spent all your money in a news
                   flash. Trust me on that, Sara.

      Sara stares at her, uncomprehending at first. She
      resists the urge to slap the smile off Toni's face.   She
      gets in it instead.

                                 SARA
                   Toni, listen carefully. You're a
                   simple bitch and you don't have
                   any friends, black or white,
                   because nobody likes a fucking
                   asshole.

      She storms off leaving Toni, for once, speechless.


162   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY/CAFETERIA - DAY                 162

      Sara. Caught up in a throng of kids and    somehow very
      separate from them. The walls have been    transformed into
      veritable billboards for the senior prom   -- decorations
      are everywhere. Sara continues down the    hallway almost
      aimlessly into the...


163   INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            163

      Sara. Carrying a food tray, eyes searching for a place
      to sit. She picks up Chenille and her girls at one
      table... Nikki and her crew at another... Patrick and
      Snookie... and, finally, Toni. Sara dumps her food into
      a trash can, walks out.

                                                             107.

164   INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY                                       164

      Sara. Alone. She pushes the tape from Patrick into an
      ancient recorder. The MUSIC COMES ON. She takes to the
      floor. Her face is like a pinched nerve. She wants to
      cry. She tries to dance.


165   INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                      165

      Sara's on the futon, flipping through a photo album.
      Pictures of her and Glynn. Roy knocks on the partition.
      Waits a beat before he comes in. He looks at Sara. She
      keeps flipping.

                              ROY
                I was wondering... how long you
                plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an
                optimist but I hope there's some
                kind of timetable.
                       (this raises a
                        small smile)
                Well, I don't wanna bug you. I
                just came in to say good luck.

      Sara regards him quizzically. Roy goes to her dresser,
      picks up an envelope from Juilliard.

                              ROY
                I saw the return address. Got
                curious. It was open. I read it.
                I know I shouldn't have but at
                least now I have an excuse to tell
                you how proud I am of you, Sara.

                              SARA
                       (quietly miserable)
                I was gonna tell you about the
                audition, Roy. I meant to.

      She's clutching the photo album.    Roy sits down next to
      her.

                              ROY
                Tomorrow's the big day?

                               SARA
                Uh-huh.   The big day.

                               ROY
                You bummed out about it?
                        (as she shakes
                         her head)
                You're a worse liar than I am
                father.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                   108.

165   CONTINUED:                                                          165

                                 SARA
                   You're not so bad.
                          (close to a
                           confession)
                   I didn't give you much to work
                   with. It's not like I've been the
                   perfect daughter.

                              ROY
                Well, it ain't like I deserve a
                perfect daughter. I screwed up.
                Did everything in a hurry and
                still thought I had all the time
                in the world. To be in love with
                your mother. Be a father to you.
                But time flies. You look up one
                day and all you got to show for
                yourself is a pretty little girl
                who hates your guts and won't talk
                to you because too much time went
                by.

      Sara's eyes well up.    Before she can stop herself,        she's
      crying.

                              SARA
                I don't hate you. I miss her. I
                miss Mom...
                       (as Roy takes her
                        in his arms, tries
                        to console her)
                ... Patrick's pissed at me. I'm
                pissed at him. He's not coming
                tomorrow and I want him there and
                I don't know what to do.

      Sara draws back from Roy, wipes her tears.       Collects
      herself.

                              ROY
                You want him there. I understand
                that. But whatever he brings to
                the table, Patrick can't dance for
                you, Sara. You're the bottom line
                out there. This is your chance to
                be the dancer Juilliard came to
                see.

                              SARA
                I wanted somebody there who loves
                me.

      Roy regards her softly, significantly, the irony
      implicit.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                 ROY
                   I love you.

      Sara looks up.    For the first time in her life, she
      believes him.


166   INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. WAITING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING         166

      Patrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to Arvel's
      parents, who are clearly stricken. Arvel's father,
      stoic, holds his wife's hand. Arvel's mother kneads a
      Kleenex, her face etched with tears. Patrick hugs her.
      Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off
      by the palpable grief. Patrick crosses over to him.
      They retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for
      Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation.

                                 MALAKAI
                   Why his mom's cryin' like that?
                   Arvel's gonna make it, right?
                   That what's his nurse said. She
                   told me herself, 'Your friend's
                   gonna make it.' Did that bitch
                   lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick!
                   Is he gone?

      Patrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room, backs
      him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds
      him there.

                                 PATRICK
                   They just got bad news, man. They
                   don't need to hear it again.
                          (trying to be
                           strong; faltering)
                   Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull
                   through. Thing is, when he does,
                   they don't think... he ain't...
                   shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk
                   again.

      In that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul
      crumbles. He looks at Patrick with aggrieved disbelief
      and then a building anger. A stronger man would probably
      cry.

      Patrick eases his grip. Malakai straightens his body,
      cocks his head slightly. Studies Patrick in this
      crooked, derisive way.

                                 MALAKAI
                   I got a good reason now, man?
                                 (MORE)

                                 MALAKAI (CONT'D)
                          (off Patrick's silence)
                   Aw'ight, college boy. You do what
                   you think is the right thing.
                   I'ma do what I know is the only
                   thing.

      He starts to walk off, doesn't get far before Patrick
      calls out.

                                 PATRICK
                   Malakai...
                          (a fleeting hesitation)
                   ... When it's on, I'll be there.


167   EXT. PLAYGROUND (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PARK) - DAY                  167

      Groups of children scatter around worn-out playground
      equipment. The gleeful squeal of them is everywhere.
      Patrick guides Christopher down a slide; Chenille catches
      him at the bottom. Christopher can't get enough of this
      ride and Patrick and Chenille repeat the routine
      throughout their conversation.

                                 CHENILLE
                   Why you so quiet?
                          (off Patrick's
                           brooding look)
                   Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin'
                   to say? That's a first.
                          (catches her son
                           with a whee!; then)
                   You know how I go off on folks
                   sometimes. I mean it and then I
                   don't mean it. Like what I said
                   to Sara. Guess she told you.

                                 PATRICK
                          (monotone)
                   I don't care what you said,
                   Chenille.

                                 CHENILLE
                   Patrick. Your ass is on your back
                   and your lips are on the ground.
                   You care, baby brother. And not
                   just about what I said.
                          (as he looks at her)
                   You seriously like Sara. She got
                   a serious jones for you. Am I
                   lyin'?

167   CONTINUED:                                                       167

                                 PATRICK
                   It's besides the point. Whatever
                   point it is you tryin' to make.

                              CHENILLE
                I'm sayin' you can't help who you
                love, Patrick. At least you found
                somebody who loves you back.

      Patrick regards Chenille impassively.    Hands Christopher
      to her.

                                PATRICK
                I gotta go.

                              CHENILLE
                To where? To who? Malakai?
                       (sucks her teeth)
                You ain't through with that fool
                yet.

                              PATRICK
                He's not a fool, Chenille.

                              CHENILLE
                No. You know what? You're the
                fool, Patrick. You think you let
                Malakai down and all you did was
                try to pull yourself up. Ain't no
                blame or shame in that.

                                 PATRICK
                          (very low; a broken smile)
                   I still gotta go. Check you
                   later.

      Holding Christopher, Chenille watches Patrick walk out of
      the playground. Disappear. She and Christopher move on
      to a seesaw. Chenille bobs him up and down on one end of
      it. She's snuggling in Christopher's face when the other
      end suddenly drops to the ground. Chenille looks up.
      Sees Kenny.


168   EXT. PLAYGROUND - SWINGS - CHENILLE AND KENNY - LATER            168

      They're side by side on swings. Christopher's nestled
      against Kenny's chest, soundly snoozing. They slowly
      swing throughout.

                                 KENNY

                   I shouldn't have... I was

                   You always trip. I'm used to
                   that. Besides, you were right.
                   You were wrong, too. So was I. I
                   need to do better. Ain't no doubt
                   about that.

                                 CHENILLE
                   I know I come down on you hard
                   about money, but I would rather
                   you spend the time. Seriously.

                      (jokingly)

               I didn't say all that.

      He smiles. Gently rubs Christopher's brow.          Looks at
      her. Chenille smiles at him.

                                 KENNY
                   I love my son, Chenille.    You know

                   Yeah.   I always knew that.

      The house lights      are on. Several seats in the front row
      are taken up by      judges for Juilliard. Further back are
      the families and      friends of other dancers. PUSH IN and
      FAVOR Roy among      them.

      A sign on it reads: "JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE -
      BALTIMORE AUDITIONS." She stares at it, fingers the
      clover leaf necklace with an unsettling sense of deja vu.


      ANGLE - WOMAN

      with a PINCE-NEZ with a clipboard, navigating among the
      dancers with a clipboard. She calls out:

172   EXT. STREET (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS) - NIGHT                      172

      Patrick's waiting on the sidewalk. Malakai pulls up in
      Tute's BMW. Lip's in the backseat. Patrick gets into
      the car. It takes off down the street.


173   EXT./INT. STREET - BMW - DRIVING - NIGHT                     173

      RAP MUSIC blasts ON the RADIO. No one in the car is
      saying anything. Malakai has a "40" between his legs.
      He sips from it, passes it to Patrick. Patrick takes a
      short swig, passes it back to Lip. As he does this, a
      set of keys fall out of his jacket into his lap. Patrick
      picks them up. Looks at the key chain, his present from
      Sara. He looks at Malakai.

                             PATRICK
               Pull over.
                      (as Malakai glances at
                       him, not understanding)
               This ain't helpin' nobody, 'Kai.
               I'm out. I mean it. Stop the
               car.

                                 LIP
               Awww, shit.      Here we go.

                             MALAKAI
                      (furious)
               What you mean you out? You think
               I'ma let your punk ass bail on me
               again?

      Patrick starts to open the door. Malakai speeds up. The
      CAR CAREENS down the street, SQUEALS around corners.
      Finally comes to a red light. Stops. Patrick starts to
      open the door. Malakai grabs him by the jacket. Pulls
      his gun. Patrick looks at Malakai and now he sees him.
      Sees that he's lost and desperate... and dangerous.

                   What you gonna do, 'Kai? You
                   gonna shoot me? Go ahead! You'll
                   have to!

                                  LIP
                   Let him out!   We don't need him.

                              MALAKAI
                Shut the fuck up.

      Patrick jerks himself loose. Opens the door. Malakai
      cocks the gun. Patrick's face flinches at the sound of
      it. He can feel it trained on his back as he gets out
      the car. But Malakai can't do it. Wouldn't do it. He
      takes off like a bat out of hell.


174   EXT. STREET                                                       174

      Patrick heads down the street. As he walks, he can hear
      the sound of GUNFIRE behind him, and then the sound like
      an EXPLOSION. A CAR HORN goes off in a persistent drone.
      Patrick stops. Stands there for a moment. Then he's
      walking again. Without looking back. And then he's
      running away from the mayhem behind him.


175   EXT. STREET - SAME TIME                                           175

      The BMW's tangled around a street lamp. Inside Malakai
      slumps over the steering wheel, a bullet through his
      head.

      NIGHT

      Pince-Nez leads Sara to the stage.      Announces her.

      Sara walks onstage.

      She nods down at the judges, looks out into the audience.
      Her eyes anxiously search for Patrick... hoping. Her
      MUSIC begins.

      Grieg's Peer Gynt (Morning). Sara starts to sway, moving
      like an angel through the soft cloud of this music. Her
      line, proportion and balance are impeccable.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

176   CONTINUED:                                                   176

      Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake (Tanz der Schwane) begins and
      Sara slowly blossoms, opening herself up to the music
      like a flower. She completes every turn and twist and
      leap with confidence, energy and persuasion. She is
      doing what a dancer should do -- engaging the audience,
      igniting their imagination, drawing them in.


      ANGLE - JUDGES

      perking up, taking notes, attentive to her.


      SARA

      finishes with a flawless arabesque.      Looks out.


      REVERSE ANGLE - JUDGES

      One of the more imperious-appearing JUDGES removes his
      glasses, speaks to her. Sara's still trying to catch her
      breath.

                              STERN JUDGE
                You prepared a free-form?

                              SARA
                Yes... sir... they have... my
                music.

                              JUDGE
                Does it have a theme?

                              SARA
                Yes.  Emo...
                       (clears her throat)
                Emotion.

      The Judge turns around, shouts to someone we can't see:

                                 STERN JUDGE
                   Cue Johnson's music.

      MUSIC UP: A remix of hip-hop (e.g., LAURYN'S HILL'S doo
      wop; NAS'S "We Will Survive" and JAY Z's latest) and
      snatches of CLASSICAL.


      SARA

      stands there. Doesn't move. Can't. She finally walks
      up to the edge of the stage. Looks down at the judges,
      her eyes filled with trepidation. Her voice is a shaky
      whisper.

                   I'm sorry. I wasn't ready.       Can
                   you start it over again?


      REVERSE ANGLE

      The Judge waving off the MUSIC.      It STOPS.      He regards
      Sara impatiently.

                                 STERN JUDGE
                   Are you ready now?

      Before she can respond, Patrick's voice booms from the
      back of the auditorium.

                                   PATRICK (O.S.)
                   Yes, sir.    She's ready.

      ANGLE WIDENS to reveal him coming forward. Rushing for
      the stage. He pauses at the apron of it. Looks up at
      Sara. She peers down at him, astounded. Shaken. He
      smiles at her. She smiles back. Patrick's eyes softly
      take her in.

                                  PATRICK
                   You can do it.
                          (because)
                   Ain't nobody watchin' you but me.

      Sara's eyes focus on him.       She nods.     Turns to the
      judges.

                                   SARA
                   I'm ready.

      As her MUSIC cues up, Patrick slowly backs away from the
      stage.

      Sara begins to dance.

      She starts out strong and gets stronger. Every emotion
      she feels, every experience she's had, comes to life in a
      way that we've never seen before, not even when she was
      practicing with Patrick. Her body has finally found a
      way to get inside this kind of music, to elevate its
      meaning and transform her dance.

      The MUSIC ENDS.     The lights go up.

      Sara stands in the middle of the stage breathless,
      sweating. She lifts her head slowly and the ANGLE WIDENS
      to reveal --

      Patrick letting out a giant whoop...

      The judges react and the audience gasps...

      ... as he bounds onto the stage and...

      Roy jumps to his feet.      Proudly and loudly clapping.
      Just like Glynn.

      ANGLE - SARA

      overwhelmed beyond belief. Patrick's coming toward her.
      She flies into his arms, free and happy, overjoyed. But
      the triumph of her performance and the sheer bliss of the
      moment are transcended by something deeper and clearer,
      which is her love for Patrick.


      JUDGES

      struggling to maintain their and the proceeding's
      decorum, since the audience, caught up in the throes of
      this excitement, has begun to loudly, enthusiastically
      react.

                                 STERN JUDGE
                   Ladies and gentlemen, please!
                          (to Patrick)
                   Young man! Get off the stage.

      WIDER to reveal the room.

      Patrick hugging Sara, looks down at the judges.

                              PATRICK
                All due respect, if ya'll don't
                let this girl in, you're crazy!

      Sara pulls Patrick back. Walks alone to the edge of the
      stage, composed and professional again. She regards the
      judges with a beaming resolve and a ballerina's curtsy,
      then simply says:

                                  SARA
                   Thank you.   Very much.

                   Ms. Johnson!

      Sara stops.    Turns back to him.      The Judge smiles.

                                 STERN JUDGE
                   I can't say this on the record --
                   yet. But welcome to Juilliard.

      lovely and radiant as it breaks into a cheek-to-cheek
      smile. WIDER as she walks slowly, deliberately back to
      Patrick. Stops. Looks at him. Just looks. And then
      she throws her arms around his neck, kissing and hugging
      him. Emotional. Patrick swings her into the air, twirls
      her around and around, as we:

      OVER SLOW MUSIC (possible theme song):

      And we see that it's the senior prom.

      The room's dressed up like a dreamy, futuristic romantic
      illusion. The ceiling's ablaze with tiny, star-like
      lights; under them large poufs of cotton clouds hang.
      Glittering, mirrored balls dangle over the main floor.

      Seniors dance in traditional and cutting edge tuxes and
      mouth-watering, eye-popping versions of dresses and
      gowns. CAMERA PANS the floor, PICKING UP:

      A surprisingly dashing Snookie and the fly girl. As they
      dance, he bravely but rather too abruptly dips her...

      Diggy (in a glitter tuxedo and spiked hair) and her
      date...

      Nikki with whom we shall perceive to be the Howard
      University guy. In any event, he looks slightly bored.

      Chenille with Kenny, smiles at Sara as she and Patrick
      dance by.

      CAMERA FAVORS and PUSHES IN ON...

      Sara and Patrick. Gazing at each other.     The SONG ENDS

               A series of traveling shots. A well-dressed, pompous-looking 
               individual (JOHN DASHWOOD, 35) is making an urgent journey 
               on horseback. He looks anxious.

               EXT. NORLAND PARK - ENGLAND - MARCH 1800 - NIGHT

               Silence. Norland Park, a large country house built in the 
               early part of the eighteenth century, lies in the moonlit 
               parkland.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - MR DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               In the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a MAN 
               (MR DASHWOOD, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured. 
               Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing 
               susurrating in the deathly hush. DOCTORS. A WOMAN (MRS 
               DASHWOOD, 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes 
               never leaving his face.

                         We expect him at any moment, dearest.

               MR DASHWOOD looks anguished.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         The girls--I have left so little.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Shh, hush, Henry.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         Elinor will try to look after you 
                         all, but make sure she finds a good 
                         husband. The men are such noodles 
                         hereabouts, little wonder none has 
                         pleased her.

               They smile at each other. MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to 
               conceal her fear and grief

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         But Marianne is sure to find her 
                         storybook hero.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         A romantic poet with flashing eyes 
                         and empty pockets?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         As long as she loves him, whoever he 
                         is.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         Margaret will go to sea and become a 
                         pirate so we need not concern 
                         ourselves with her.

               MRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older 
               MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every 
               feature.

                                     THOMAS
                         Your son is arrived from London, 
                         sir.

               MR DASHWOOD squeezes his wife's hand.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         Let me speak to John alone.

               She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite 
               tenderness.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         Ah, my dear. How happy you have made 
                         me.

               MRS DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She 
               allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as 
               he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes 
               her place by the bed.

                                     JOHN
                         Father...

               MR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to 
               whisper with desperate intensity.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         John you will find out soon enough 
                         from my will that the estate of 
                         Norland was left to me in such a way 
                         as prevents me from dividing it 
                         between my families.

               JOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in.

                                     JOHN
                         Calm yourself, Father. This is not 
                         good for you.

               But MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         Norland in its entirety is therefore 
                         yours by law and I am happy for you 
                         and Fanny.

               JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected 
               delight.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         But your stepmother my wife and 
                         daughters are left with only five 
                         hundred pounds a year, barely enough 
                         to live on and nothing for the girls' 
                         dowries. You must help them.

               JOHN's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind 
               them is the ominous rustling of parchments.

                                     JOHN
                         Of course

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         You must promise to do this.

               A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN's natural 
               hypocrisy.

                                     JOHN
                         I promise, Father, I promise.

               MR DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes. 
               JOHN looks alarmed. He rises and we hear him going to find 
               the DOCTOR.

                                     JOHN
                         Come! Come quickly!

               But it is we who share the dying man's last words.

                                     MR DASHWOOD
                         Help them.

               EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

               Outside the house sits a very well-to-do carriage. Behind it 
               waits another open carriage upon which servants are laying 
               trunks and boxes.

                                     FANNY (V.O.)
                         'Help them?'

               INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY

               JOHN is standing in mourning clothes and a traveling cape. 
               He is watching, and obviously waiting for, a pert WOMAN (FANNY 
               DASHWOOD) who is standing by a mirror looking at him keenly.

                                     FANNY
                         What do you mean, 'help them'?

                                     JOHN
                         Dearest, I mean to give them three 
                         thousand pounds.

               FANNY goes very still. JOHN gets nervous.

                                     JOHN
                         The interest will provide them with 
                         a little extra income. Such a gift 
                         will certainly discharge my promise 
                         to my father.

               FANNY slowly turns back to the mirror.

                                     FANNY
                         Oh, without question! More than 
                         amply...

                                     JOHN
                         One had rather, on such occasions, 
                         do too much than too little.

               A pause as FANNY turns and looks at him again.

                                     JOHN
                         Of course, he did not stipulate a 
                         particular sum.

               INT. LAUNDRY - NORLAND PARK - DAY

               A red-eyed MAID (BETSY) plunges a beautiful muslin frock 
               into a vat of black dye.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - MRS DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - DAY

               MRS DASHWOOD is rushing about, mourning ribbons flapping, 
               putting her knick-knacks into a small valise. The room is in 
               chaos. A young WOMAN (ELINOR DASHWOOD) looks on helplessly.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         To be reduced to the condition of 
                         visitor in my own home! It is not to 
                         be borne, Elinor!

                                     ELINOR
                         Consider, Mamma! We have nowhere to 
                         go.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         John and Fanny will descend from 
                         London at any moment, followed no 
                         doubt by cartloads of relatives ready 
                         to turn us out of our rooms one by 
                         one do you expect me to be here to 
                         welcome them? Vultures!

               She suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears.

                                     ELINOR
                         I shall start making inquiries for a 
                         new house at once. Until then we 
                         must try to bear their coming.

               INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY

               JOHN and FANNY are on their way out of London.

                                     JOHN
                         Fifteen hundred then. What say you 
                         to fifteen hundred?

                                     FANNY
                         What brother on earth would do half 
                         so much for his real sisters--let 
                         alone half-blood?

                                     JOHN
                         They can hardly expect more.

                                     FANNY
                         There is no knowing what they expect. 
                         The question is, what can you afford?

               INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               A beautiful young WOMAN (MARIANNE DASHWOOD) is sitting at 
               the piano playing a particularly sad piece. ELINOR enters.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, cannot you play something 
                         else? Mamma has been weeping since 
                         breakfast.

               MARIANNE stops, turns the pages of her music book and starts 
               playing something equally lugubrious.

                                     ELINOR
                         I meant something less mournful, 
                         dearest.

               EXT. ROADSIDE INN - DAY

               JOHN and FANNY are waiting as the OSTLERS make the final 
               adjustments to their carriage. The LANDLORD hovers, waiting 
               for a tip.

                                     JOHN
                         A hundred pounds a year to their 
                         mother while she lives. Would that 
                         be more advisable? It is better than 
                         parting with the fifteen hundred all 
                         at once.

               He displays some coins in his hand. FANNY removes one and 
               nods.

                                     FANNY
                         But if she should live longer than 
                         fifteen years we would be completely 
                         taken in. People always live forever 
                         when there is an annuity to be paid 
                         them.

               JOHN gives the coins to the LANDLORD.

               EXT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET'S TREE-HOUSE - DAY

               ELINOR comes to the foot of a large tree from which a small 
               staircase issues.

                                     ELINOR
                         Margaret, are you there? Please come 
                         down. John and Fanny will be here 
                         soon.

               A pause. ELINOR is about to leave when a disembodied and 
               truculent young voice stops her.

                                     MARGARET (V.O.)
                         Why are they coming to live at 
                         Norland? They already have a house 
                         in London.

                                     ELINOR
                         Because houses go from father to 
                         son, dearest not from father to 
                         daughter. It is the law.

               Silence. ELINOR tries another tack.

                                     ELINOR
                         If you come inside, we could play 
                         with your atlas.

                                     MARGARET (V.O.)
                         It's not my atlas any more. It's 
                         their atlas.

               CLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this statement.

               INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY

               JOHN and FANNY joggle on.

                                     JOHN
                         Twenty pounds now and then will amply 
                         discharge my promise, you are quite 
                         right.

                                     FANNY
                         Indeed. Although to say the truth, I 
                         am convinced within myself that your 
                         father had no idea of your giving 
                         them money.

                                     JOHN
                         They will have five hundred a year 
                         amongst them as it is--

                                     FANNY
                         --and what on earth can four women 
                         want for more than that? Their 
                         housekeeping will be nothing at all 
                         they will have no carriage, no horses, 
                         hardly any servants and will keep no 
                         company. Only conceive how comfortable 
                         they will be!

               INT. NORLAND PARK - SERVANTS' HALL - DAY

               The large contingent of SERVANTS who staff Norland Park are 
               gathered in gloomy silence as ELINOR addresses them.

                                     ELINOR
                         As you know, we are looking for a 
                         new home. When we leave we shall be 
                         able to retain only Thomas and Betsy.

               CAM holds on THOMAS and BETSY, a capable woman.

                                     ELINOR
                         We are very sorry to have to leave 
                         you all. But we are certain you will 
                         find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and 
                         generous mistress.

               EXT. NORLAND PARK. DRIVE - DAY

               JOHN and FANNY's carriage approaches Norland.

                                     FANNY (V.O.)
                         They will be much more able to give 
                         you something.

               INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S CARRIAGE - DAY

               JOHN and FANNY are about to get out.

                                     JOHN
                         So we are agreed. No money but the 
                         occasional gift of game and fish in 
                         season will be very welcome.

                                     FANNY
                         Your father would be proud of you.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EARLY EVE

               The entire family, with the exception of MARGARET, is present. 
               BETSY is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence. 
               Cutlery clinks. JOHN chews loudly. MARIANNE is rigid with 
               resentment. MRS DASHWOOD maintains a cool, removed dignity. 
               ELINOR tries to play hostess.

                                     ELINOR
                         How is Mrs Ferrars?

                                     FANNY
                         My mother is always in excellent 
                         health, thank you. My brother Robert 
                         is in town with her this season and 
                         quite the most popular bachelor in 
                         London! He has his own barouche.

               In the brief silence which follows this, FANNY surreptitiously 
               checks the hallmark on her butterknife.

                                     ELINOR
                         You have two brothers, have you not?

                                     FANNY
                         Indeed, yes. Edward is the eldest 
                         Mamma quite depends upon him. He is 
                         traveling up from Plymouth shortly 
                         and will break his journey here.

               MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR pointedly. JOHN notices.

                                     JOHN
                              (to MRS DASHWOOD)
                         If that is agreeable to you, of 
                         course.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         My dear John this is your home now.

               FANNY looks about, barely able to conceal her satisfaction.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - DAY

               ELINOR is sitting with a little pile of parcels. She puts a 
               shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as MARIANNE 
               thunders in, looking mutinous.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Fanny wishes to know where the key 
                         for the silver cabinet is kept.

                                     ELINOR
                         Betsy has it, I think. What does 
                         Fanny want with the silver?

                                     MARIANNE
                         I can only presume she wants to count 
                         it. What are you doing?

                                     ELINOR
                         Presents for the servants. Have you 
                         seen Margaret? I am worried about 
                         her. She has taken to hiding in the 
                         oddest places.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Fortunate girl. At least she can 
                         escape Fanny, which is more than any 
                         of us is able.

                                     ELINOR
                         You do your best. You have not said 
                         a word to her for a week.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (truculently)
                         I have! I have said 'yes' and 'no'.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

               FANNY, MRS DASHWOOD, ELINOR and JOHN are at breakfast. 
               MARIANNE enters. ELINOR catches her eye and indicates FANNY 
               with a slight motion of her head. MARIANNE makes a face.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (very polite)
                         Good morning, Fanny.

               FANNY is rather startled.

                                     FANNY
                         Good morning, Marianne.

               ELINOR is relieved.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (to Fanny)
                         How did you find the silver? Is it 
                         all genuine?

               ELINOR rushes in before MARIANNE gets any further.

                                     ELINOR
                         Pray, when may we expect the pleasure 
                         of your brother's company?

                                     FANNY
                         Edward is due tomorrow. And my dear 
                         Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact 
                         that he will not be with us for long, 
                         I wondered if Miss Margaret would 
                         mind giving up her room to him the 
                         view is quite incomparable from her 
                         windows and I should so much like 
                         Edward to see Norland at its best.

               MARIANNE slams her cup down and throws a furious look at 
               ELINOR.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - MARGARET'S BEDROOM - DAY

               ELINOR and MARIANNE are removing MARGARET's toys.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Intolerable woman!

                                     ELINOR
                         There is but one consolation if Edward 
                         is anything like Fanny, we shall be 
                         only too happy to leave.

               EXT. NORLAND PARK - DRIVE - DAY

               A very capable HORSEMAN (EDWARD FERRARS) canters up the gravel 
               drive.

               CLOSE on his face as he gazes up at the elegant façade.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               Everyone except MARGARET is present. EDWARD has just shaken 
               bands with ELINOR. He behaves with great respect to the 
               DASHWOODS and seems embarrassed by FANNY's pro prietorial 
               air.

                                     FANNY
                         But where is Miss Margaret? I declare, 
                         Mrs Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt 
                         of her existence! She must run 
                         positively wild!

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest 
                         is not to be found this morning. She 
                         is a little shy of strangers at 
                         present.

                                     EDWARD
                         Naturally. I am also shy of strangers 
                         and I have nothing like her excuse.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (dangerous)
                         How do you like your view, Mr Ferrars?

               ELINOR glances at her warningly but EDWARD replies with 
               careful consideration.

                                     EDWARD
                         Very much. Your stables are very 
                         handsome and beautifully kept, Mrs 
                         Dashwood.

                                     FANNY
                         Stables! Edward--your windows overlook 
                         the lake.

                                     EDWARD
                         An oversight, Fanny, led me to the 
                         wrong room. I have rectified the 
                         situation and am happily settled in 
                         the guest quarters.

               MARIANNE and ELINOR look at each other in surprise. FANNY 
               looks furious.

               MRS DASHWOOD smiles warmly at EDWARD.

               CLOSE on ELINOR. She is impressed.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - STAIRCASE - DAY

               FANNY is walking with EDWARD, who looks at the pictures with 
               interest.

                                     FANNY
                         They are all exceedingly spoilt, I 
                         find. Miss Margaret spends all her 
                         time up trees and under furniture 
                         and I have barely had a civil word 
                         from Marianne.

                                     EDWARD
                         My dear Fanny, they have just lost 
                         their father their lives will never 
                         be the same again.

                                     FANNY
                         That is no excuse.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY

               FANNY leads EDWARD in. She sniffs with distaste.

                                     FANNY
                         I have never liked the smell of books.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh? No. The dust, perhaps.

               As they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating 
               apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is 
               obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He 
               registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield 
               it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to 
               divert her.

                                     EDWARD
                         I hear you have great plans for the 
                         walnut grove.

                                     FANNY
                         Oh yes! I shall have it pulled down 
                         to make room for a Grecian temple.

               There is a stifled wail from under the table, which EDWARD 
               covers with a cough.

                                     EDWARD
                         How picturesque. Will you show me 
                         the site?

               And he ushers FANNY out, flicking a quick glance over his 
               shoulder at the fugitive's foot.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - DAY

               ELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE are sitting round a table 
               with a pile of letters. ELINOR is handing one back to her 
               mother.

                                     ELINOR
                         Too expensive. We do not need four 
                         bedrooms, we can share.

                                     MARIANNE
                         This one, then?

               ELINOR reads the letter quickly.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, we have only five hundred 
                         pounds a year. I will send out more 
                         inquiries today.

               There is a knock on the door. Hesitantly, EDWARD appears.

                                     EDWARD
                         Pardon my intrusion, but I believe I 
                         have found what you are looking for.

               MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are puzzled by his elliptical manner 
               but ELINOR immediately understands and rises, in smiling 
               relief.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - ENTRANCE HALL OUTSIDE LIBRARY - DAY

               EDWARD is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. The 
               door is half open and he can hear ELINOR trying to coax 
               MARGARET out. FANNY walks by with a BUTLER to whom she is 
               giving instructions. EDWARD pretends to examine the mouldings 
               and she passes on unsuspecting.

                                     ELINOR (V.O.)
                         Won't you come out, dearest? We 
                         haven't seen you all day. Mamma is 
                         very concerned.

               More silence. EDWARD thinks hard. He makes a decision.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY

               EDWARD walks in loudly.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was 
                         wondering do you by any chance have 
                         such a thing as a reliable atlas?

               ELINOR looks up at him in astonishment.

                                     ELINOR
                         I believe so.

                                     EDWARD
                         Excellent. I wish to check the 
                         position of the Nile.

               EDWARD appears to be utterly sincere.

                                     EDWARD
                         My sister says it is in South America.

               From under the table we hear a snort. ELINOR looks at him in 
               realisation.

                                     ELINOR
                         Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong. 
                         For I believe it is in--in Belgium.

                                     EDWARD
                         Belgium? Surely not. You must be 
                         thinking of the Volga.

                                     MARGARET
                              (from under the table)
                         The Volga?

                                     ELINOR
                         Of course. The Volga, which, as you 
                         know, starts in...

                                     EDWARD
                         Vladivostok, and ends in...

                                     ELINOR
                         St Albans.

                                     EDWARD
                         Indeed. Where the coffee beans come 
                         from.

               They are having such a good time that it is rather a pity 
               the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table 
               of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of 
               eleven. She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of 
               EDWARD.

                                     MARGARET
                         The source of the Nile is in 
                         Abyssinia.

                                     EDWARD
                         Is it? Good heavens. How do you do. 
                         Edward Ferrars.

                                     MARGARET
                         Margaret Dashwood.

               EDWARD shakes MARGARET's hand solemnly and looks over her 
               head at ELINOR. They smile at each other, a connection made.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

               JOHN is reading a newspaper. MRS DASHWOOD sits across from 
               FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR 
               is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words 
               'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'. 
               Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past 
               the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds 
               to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They 
               feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of 
               condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD 
               suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR's gaze. She smiles 
               but looks away quickly.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

               EDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening 
               to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful, 
               rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses 
               EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away, 
               embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees 
               she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He 
               comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes 
               with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner: 
               ECF.

                                     ELINOR
                              (apologetic)
                         That was my father's favourite.

               EDWARD nods kindly.

                                     ELINOR
                         Thank you so much for your help with 
                         Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed 
                         girl since your arrival.

                                     EDWARD
                         Not at all. I enjoy her company.

                                     ELINOR
                         Has she shown you her tree-house?

                                     EDWARD
                         Not yet. Would you do me the honour, 
                         Miss Dashwood? It is very fine out.

                                     ELINOR
                         With pleasure.

               They start to walk out of shot, still talking.

                                     ELINOR
                         Margaret has always wanted to travel.

                                     EDWARD
                         I know. She is heading an expedition 
                         to China shortly. I am to go as her 
                         servant but only on the understanding 
                         that I will be very badly treated.

                                     ELINOR
                         What will your duties be?

                                     EDWARD
                         Sword-fighting, administering rum 
                         and swabbing.

                                     ELINOR
                         Ah.

               CAM tilts up to find MRS DASHWOOD on the middle landing of 
               the staircase, smiling down at them. CAM tilts up yet further 
               to find FANNY on the landing above, watching EDWARD and ELINOR 
               with a face like a prune.

               EXT. NORLAND PARK - GARDENS - DAY

               EDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in arm 
               in the late afternoon sun.

                                     EDWARD
                         All I want--all I have ever wanted 
                         is the quiet of a private life but 
                         my mother is determined to see me 
                         distinguished.

                                     ELINOR
                         As?

                                     EDWARD
                         She hardly knows. Any fine figure 
                         will suit a great orator, a leading 
                         politician, even a barrister would 
                         serve, but only on the condition 
                         that I drive my own barouche and 
                         dine in the first circles.

               His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to 
               it.

                                     ELINOR
                         And what do you wish for?

                                     EDWARD
                         I always preferred the church, but 
                         that is not smart enough for my mother 
                         she prefers the army, but that is a 
                         great deal too smart for me.

                                     ELINOR
                         Would you stay in London?

                                     EDWARD
                         I hate London. No peace. A country 
                         living is my ideal a small parish 
                         where I might do some good, keep 
                         chickens and give very short sermons.

               EXT. FIELDS NEAR NORLAND - DAY

               EDWARD and ELINOR are on horseback. The atmosphere is 
               intimate, the quality of the conversation rooted now in their 
               affections.

                                     ELINOR
                         You talk of feeling idle and useless 
                         imagine how that is compounded when 
                         one has no choice and no hope 
                         whatsoever of any occupation.

               EDWARD nods and smiles at the irony of it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Our circumstances are therefore 
                         precisely the same.

                                     ELINOR
                         Except that you will inherit your 
                         fortune.

               He looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her boldness.

                                     ELINOR
                         We cannot even earn ours.

                                     EDWARD
                         Perhaps Margaret is right.

                                     ELINOR
                         Right?

                                     EDWARD
                         Piracy is our only option.

               They ride on in silence for a moment.

                                     EDWARD
                         What is swabbing exactly?

               INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE

               Dinner is over. JOHN and FANNY are examining plans of the 
               Norland estate, looking for somewhere to build a hermitage. 
               EDWARD is reading out loud. ELINOR embroiders and listens. 
               MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE make up the rest of the audience, 
               the latter in a state of high impatience.

                                     EDWARD
                         No voice divine the storm allayed No 
                         light propitious shone, When snatched 
                         from all effectual aid, We perished 
                         each alone: But I beneath a rougher 
                         sea, And whelmed in deeper gulfs 
                         than he.

               MARIANNE jumps up and goes to him.

                                     MARIANNE
                         No, Edward! Listen.

               She takes the book from him and reads the stanza with 
               passionate brio.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Can you not feel his despair? Try 
                         again.

               Rather mortified, EDWARD starts again, but not before 
               receiving a sympathetic look from ELINOR which seems to 
               comfort him a little.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - MORNING ROOM - DAY

               MRS DASHWOOD is ruminating sadly. MARIANNE rushes in holding 
               a letter.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Mamma, look. This has just arrived.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                              (reading from the 
                              letter)
                         'I should be pleased to offer you a 
                         home at Barton Cottage as soon as 
                         ever you have need of it' why, it is 
                         from my cousin, Sir John Middleton!

                                     MARIANNE
                         Even Elinor must approve the rent.

               MRS DASHWOOD looks at the letter again and thinks.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Has Elinor not yet seen this?

                                     MARIANNE
                         No I will fetch her.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Wait. No. Let us delay.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Why?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         I think--I believe that Edward and 
                         Elinor have formed an attachment.

               Marianne nods, a little reluctantly.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         It would be cruel to take her away 
                         so soon and Devonshire is so far.

               MRS DASHWOOD makes her decision. She takes the letter and 
               hides it in the pocket of her gown. MARIANNE looks on 
               frowningly.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Why so grave? Do you disapprove her 
                         choice?

                                     MARIANNE
                         By no means. Edward is very amiable.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Amiable but?

                                     MARIANNE
                         But there is something wanting. He 
                         is too sedate his reading last night.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Elinor has not your feelings, his 
                         reserve suits her.

               MARIANNE thinks for a little.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Can he love her? Can the ardour of 
                         the soul really be satisfied with 
                         such polite, concealed affections? 
                         To love is to burn to be on fire, 
                         all made of passion, of adoration, 
                         of sacrifice! Like Juliet, or 
                         Guinevere or Heloise.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         They made rather pathetic ends, dear.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Pathetic! To die for love? How can 
                         you say so? What could be more 
                         glorious?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         I think that may be taking your 
                         romantic sensibilities a little far.

                                     MARIANNE
                         The more I know of the world, the 
                         more I am convinced that I shall 
                         never see a man whom I can truly 
                         love.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         You require so much!

                                     MARIANNE
                         I do not! I require only what any 
                         young woman of taste should a man 
                         who sings well, dances admirably, 
                         rides bravely, reads with passion 
                         and whose tastes agree in every point 
                         with my own.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ELINOR is in bed, deep in thought. MARIANNE enters in her 
               nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry. She reads, teasingly.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It 
                         is immortal as immaculate truth 'Tis 
                         not a blossom shed as soon as Youth 
                         Drops from the stem of life for it 
                         will grow In barren regions, where 
                         no waters flow Nor ray of promise 
                         cheats the pensive gloom--

               She jumps onto the bed. ELINOR smiles somewhat suspiciously.

                                     MARIANNE
                         What a pity it is that Edward has no 
                         passion for reading.

                                     ELINOR
                         It was you who asked him to read and 
                         then you made him nervous.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Me?

                                     ELINOR
                         But your behaviour to him in all 
                         other respects is perfectly cordial 
                         so I must assume that you like him 
                         in spite of his deficiencies.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (trying hard)
                         I think him everything that is amiable 
                         and worthy.

                                     ELINOR
                         Praise indeed!

                                     MARIANNE
                         But he shall have my unanswering 
                         devotion when you tell me he is to 
                         be my brother.

               ELINOR is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply. 
               Suddenly MARIANNE hugs her passionately.

                                     MARIANNE
                         How shall I do without you?

                                     ELINOR
                         Do without me?

               MARIANNE pulls away, her eyes full of tears.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I am sure you will be very happy. 
                         But you must promise not to live too 
                         far away.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, there is no question of 
                         that is, there is no under standing 
                         between...

               ELINOR trails off. MARIANNE looks at her keenly.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Do you love him?

               The bold clarity of this question discomforts ELINOR.

                                     ELINOR
                         I do not attempt to deny that I think 
                         very highly of him that I greatly 
                         esteem that I like him.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Esteem him! Like him! Use those 
                         insipid words again and I shall leave 
                         the room this instant!

               This makes ELINOR laugh in spite of her discomfort.

                                     ELINOR
                         Very well. Forgive me. Believe my 
                         feelings to be stronger than I have 
                         declared but further than that you 
                         must not believe.

               MARIANNE is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up 
               her book again.

                                     MARIANNE
                         'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Or a 
                         Ferrars?

                                     ELINOR
                         Go to bed!

               ELINOR blushes in good earnest. MARIANNE goes to the door.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (imitating Elinor)
                         'I do not attempt to deny that I 
                         think highly of him greatly esteem 
                         him! Like him!'

               And she is gone, leaving ELINOR both agitated and amused.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

               FANNY is standing by the window looking out. We see her POV 
               of ELINOR and EDWARD walking in the garden.

               MRS DASHWOOD enters, pauses for a moment and then joins FANNY 
               at the window. FANNY pretends not to have been watching but 
               MRS DASHWOOD looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly 
               at her.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         We are all so happy that you chose 
                         to invite Edward to Norland. He is a 
                         dear boy and we are all very fond of 
                         him.

               FANNY does a bit of quick thinking.

                                     FANNY
                         We have great hopes for him. Much is 
                         expected of him by our mother with 
                         regard to his profession

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Naturally.

                                     FANNY
                         And in marriage. She is determined 
                         that both he and Robert will marry 
                         well.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Of course. But I hope she desires 
                         them to marry for love, first and 
                         foremost? I have always felt that, 
                         contrary to common wisdom, true 
                         affection is by far the most valuable 
                         dowry.

                                     FANNY
                         Love is all very well, but 
                         unfortunately we cannot always rely 
                         on the heart to lead us in the most 
                         suitable directions.

               FANNY lowers her voice confidingly.

                                     FANNY
                         You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward 
                         is entirely the kind of compassionate 
                         person upon whom penniless women can 
                         prey--and having entered into any 
                         kind of understanding, he would never 
                         go back on his word. He is quite 
                         simply incapable of doing so. But it 
                         would lead to his ruin. I worry for 
                         him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has 
                         always made it perfectly plain that 
                         she will withdraw all financial 
                         support from Edward, should he choose 
                         to plant his affections in less... 
                         exalted ground than he deserves.

               It is impossible for MRS DASHWOOD not to get the point. She 
               is appalled and furious.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         I understand you perfectly.

               She sweeps off.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - MRS DASHWOOD'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

               MRS DASHWOOD, breathless with rage, is searching through her 
               wardrobe for the gown which contains SIR JOHN's letter. Frocks 
               fly hither and thither. Finally MRS DASHWOOD plunges her 
               hand into the right pocket and withdraws the letter. She 
               looks at it, suddenly concerned and anxious.

               INT. NORLAND PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE

               The entire family is present. Everyone is watching MRS 
               DASHWOOD, who has just made her announcement.

                                     EDWARD
                         Devonshire!

               He is devastated. FANNY is thrilled. MRS DASHWOOD looks at 
               him with compassion and then at ELINOR, who is trying to 
               keep calm.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         My cousin Sir John Middleton has 
                         offered us a small house on his 
                         estate.

                                     JOHN
                         Sir John Middleton? What is his 
                         situation? He must be a man of 
                         property.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         He is a widower. He lives with his 
                         mother-in-law at Barton Park and it 
                         is Barton Cottage that he offers us.

                                     FANNY
                         Oh, a cottage! How charming. A little 
                         cottage is always very snug.

                                     EDWARD
                         But you will not leave before the 
                         summer?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Oh, my dear Edward, we can no longer 
                         trespass upon your sister's good 
                         will. We must leave as soon as 
                         possible.

                                     MARGARET
                         You will come and stay with us, 
                         Edward!

                                     EDWARD
                         I should like that very much.

                                     FANNY
                         Edward has long been expected in 
                         town by our mother.

               MRS DASHWOOD ignores FANNY.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Come as soon as you can, Edward. 
                         Remember that you are always welcome.

               INT/EXT. NORLAND PARK - STABLES - DAY

               ELINOR has come to say goodbye to her HORSE. She strokes the 
               soft face sadly. Then she senses someone and turns to find 
               EDWARD standing nearby.

                                     EDWARD
                         Cannot you take him with you?

                                     ELINOR
                         We cannot possibly afford him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Perhaps he could make himself useful 
                         in the kitchen?

               ELINOR tries to smile. EDWARD looks at her for a long moment 
               and then comes closer.

                                     EDWARD
                         Miss Dashwood--Elinor. I must talk 
                         to you.

               The use of her Christian name--and in such a loving tone--
               stops ELINOR's breath altogether.

                                     EDWARD
                         There is something of great importance 
                         I need... to tell you--

               He comes closer still. The HORSE breathes between them. ELINOR 
               is on fire with anticipation but EDWARD looks troubled and 
               has less the air of a suitor than he might.

                                     EDWARD
                         --about--about my education.

                                     ELINOR
                              (after a beat)
                         Your education?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes. It was less... successful than 
                         it might have been.

               EDWARD laughs nervously. ELINOR is completely bewildered.

                                     EDWARD
                         It was conducted in Plymouth--oddly 
                         enough.

                                     ELINOR
                         Indeed?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes. Do you know it?

                                     ELINOR
                         Plymouth?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes.

                                     ELINOR
                         No.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh--well--I spent four years there--
                         at a school run by a--a Mr Pratt--

                                     ELINOR
                         Pratt?

               ELINOR is beginning to feel like a parrot.

                                     EDWARD
                         Precisely--Mr Pratt--and there, I--
                         that is to say, he has a--

               As EDWARD flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this 
               unexpected foray into his academic past.

                                     FANNY
                         Edward! Edward!

               They turn to find FANNY powering down upon them, waving a 
               letter. EDWARD steps back, glancing almost guiltily at ELINOR, 
               who is as confused as we are.

                                     FANNY
                         I have been all over for you! You 
                         are needed in London this instant!

                                     EDWARD
                         Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon 
                         as it is--

                                     FANNY
                         No, no, that will not do. Family 
                         affairs are in chaos owing to your 
                         absence. Mother is quite adamant 
                         that you should leave at once.

               FANNY is determined. She obviously has no intention of leaving 
               him alone with ELINOR. EDWARD turns to ELINOR, frustration 
               in every muscle, his jaw set tight.

                                     EDWARD
                         Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.

               FANNY drags EDWARD off, leaving ELINOR to gaze sadly after 
               them.

               INT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - RAIN - EVE

               The DASHWOODS are on their way. The mood is very sombre.

                                     MARGARET
                         Edward promised he would bring the 
                         atlas to Barton for me.

               MARIANNE looks at ELINOR, pleased.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Did he? Well, I will wager he will 
                         do so in less than a fortnight!

               MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR with satisfaction.

               EXT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - EVE

               The carriage rolls on.

                                     MARGARET (V.O.)
                         Are we there yet?

               EXT. ROAD TO AND FROM BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

               In comparison to Norland, Barton Cottage has the air of a 
               damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely 
               countryside.

               From one side we can see the DASHWOODS' carriage drawing up 
               at the gate. From the other, a much grander vehicle, from 
               which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY

               As the exhausted DASHWOODS alight, they converge with a ruddy- 
               complexioned MAN in a redingote (SIR JOHN MIDDLETON) and a 
               rotund, equally roseate LADY (MRS JENNINGS) who have fallen 
               over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Sir John!

               SIR JOHN clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path, 
               followed by ELINOR, MARIANNE and MARGARET, who is clearly 
               fascinated by his bouncy companion.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my 
                         word, here you are, here you are, 
                         here you are!

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Sir John, your extraordinary kindness--

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Oh, none of that, hush, please, none 
                         of that, but here is my dear mamma-
                         in-law Mrs Jennings.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Was the journey tolerable, you poor 
                         souls?

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Why did you not come up to the Park 
                         first and take your ease? We saw you 
                         pass--Like many people who live rather 
                         lonely lives together.

               SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS talk incessantly, interrupt each 
               other all the time and never listen.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         --but I would not wait for you to 
                         come to us, I made John call for the 
                         carriage--

                                     SIR JOHN
                         She would not wait, you know.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         --as we get so little company.

               They reach the front door and BETSY's smiling welcome. In 
               the confusion of milling people and THOMAS carrying the 
               lighter luggage, MARIANNE contrives to slip into the house 
               alone. We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in 
               V.O. MARIANNE looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire 
               is smoking. She starts up the stairs, expressionless.

                                     MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
                         But I feel as if I know you already--
                         delightful creatures!

                                     SIR JOHN (V.O.)
                         Delightful! And you know you are to 
                         dine at Barton Park every day.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)
                         Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot--

                                     SIR JOHN (V.O.)
                         Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall 
                         not brook refusals. I am quite deaf 
                         to 'em, you know--

                                     MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
                         --deaf--

               MARIANNE enters a small bedroom. She sits on the bed. Then 
               she goes to the window and opens it. Voices float up.

                                     SIR JOHN (V.O.)
                         But I insist!

                                     ELINOR (V.O.)
                         Let us only settle in for a few days, 
                         Sir John, and thank you--

                                     SIR JOHN (V.O.)
                         Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't 
                         bear 'em, embarrassing, you know--

               MARIANNE closes the window and crosses the corridor to another 
               bed room--similarly stark. She sighs and turns back down the 
               stairs.

                                     SIR JOHN (V.O.)
                         We will send game and fruit as a 
                         matter of course--

                                     MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
                         --fruit and game--

                                     SIR JOHN (V.O.)
                         --and the carriage is at your beck 
                         and call--

               MARIANNE joins the group, who are now in the parlour.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         --call--and here is Miss Marianne!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Where did you disappear to?

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I declare you are the loveliest girl 
                         I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get 
                         them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must 
                         not leave it too long!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         But, alas, there are no smart young 
                         men hereabouts to woo them--

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         --not a beau for miles!

               The strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to 
               tell on MRS DASHWOOD who is sagging visibly.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Come, Mother, let us leave them in 
                         peace.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         But there is Colonel Brandon!

               SIR JOHN is dragging her down the path.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Excellent fellow! We served in the 
                         East India Regiment together.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Just wait till he sees you! If we 
                         can persuade him out to meet you!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Reclusive individual. But you are 
                         fatigued. I can see that you are 
                         fatigued.

               Now he is pushing her into the carriage.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Of course she is fatigued!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Come along, Mother, we really must 
                         leave them to themselves.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         You must get your maidservant to 
                         make you up some camphor--it is the 
                         best tonic for the staggers!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Send Thomas to us for the carriage 
                         when you are ready!

               They take off, waving wildly. MARGARET goes down the path to 
               watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family.

                                     MARGARET
                         I like them.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                              (weakly)
                         What generosity.

                                     ELINOR
                         Indeed. I am surprised they did not 
                         offer us their clothing.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               MARIANNE and ELINOR are getting undressed for bed. it's very 
               cold. They keep their underclothing on and get in, shivering 
               at the bony chill of the linen.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY

               BETSY is pinning out laundry.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

               MARGARET tries to climb an impossible tree. Her petticoats 
               snag and tear.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               MARIANNE looks out of the window at the wild countryside. 
               Uncon sciously, one hand plays up and down on the sill as 
               though it were a keyboard.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               ELINOR sits at a little desk counting money and making notes. 
               BETSY enters to clean out the fire. She notices the money.

                                     BETSY
                         Sugar is five shilling a pound these 
                         parts, Miss Dashwood.

                                     ELINOR
                              (lightly)
                         No more sugar then.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - EVE

               CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD looking out of the window, thinking. 
               She remembers MRS JENNINGS's words:

                                     MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
                         Not a beau for miles.

               MRS DASHWOOD turns into the room to look at her brood. ELINOR 
               and MARIANNE are mending MARGARET's petticoats. CLOSE on the 
               mother's anxious expression--what is to become of them?

               EXT. BARTON PARK - EVE

               Establishing shot of SIR JOHN's house--a very comfortable-
               looking country seat with fine grounds.

                                     SIR JOHN (V.O.)
                         Where can Brandon be, poor fellow? I 
                         hope he has not lamed his horse.

               INT. BARTON PARK - DINING ROOM - EVE

               CLOSE on an empty chair and place setting. Pull out to reveal 
               the DASHWOODS at their first dinner with SIR JOHN and MRS 
               JENNINGS.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Colonel Brandon is the most eligible 
                         bachelor in the county--he is bound 
                         to do for one of you. Mind, he is a 
                         better age for Miss Dashwood--but I 
                         dare say she left her heart behind 
                         in Sussex, eh?

               MARIANNE flashes an unmistakable glance of alarmed concern 
               at her sister, which MRS JENNINGS notices.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Aha! I see you, Miss Marianne! I 
                         think I have unearthed a secret!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Oho! Have you sniffed one out already, 
                         Mother? You are worse than my best 
                         pointer, Flossie!

               They both laugh immoderately. ELINOR tries to stay calm.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         What sort of man is he, Miss Dashwood? 
                         Is he butcher, baker, candlestick-
                         maker? I shall winkle it out of you 
                         somehow, you know!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         She's horribly good at winkling.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         You are in lonely country now, Miss 
                         Dashwood, none of us has any secrets 
                         here--

                                     SIR JOHN
                         --or if we do, we do not keep them 
                         for long!

               ELINOR tries to smile. MARIANNE looks furious. MARGARET is 
               staring at MRS JENNINGS as if she were some particularly 
               thrilling form of wildlife.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         He is curate of the parish, I dare 
                         say!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Or a handsome lieutenant!

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he 
                         in uniform?

               ELINOR starts to change the subject, but MARGARET interrupts 
               her.

                                     MARGARET
                         He has no profession!

               SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS turn on her with screams of delight. 
               ELINOR, MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD look at each other 
               helplessly.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         No profession! A gentleman, then!

                                     MARIANNE
                              (with daggers)
                         Margaret, you know perfectly well 
                         there is no such person.

                                     MARGARET
                         There is! There is! And his name 
                         begins with an F!

               ELINOR looks hard at her plate.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Margaret!

               MRS DASHWOOD is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a 
               vulgar game. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are cock-a-hoop.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         F indeed! A very promising letter. 
                         Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word, 
                         but I cannot think of a single name 
                         beginning with F--

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty?

               MARIANNE suddenly stands up. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are 
               so surprised they stop talking. Everyone stares at MARIANNE.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (controlled fury)
                         Sir John, might I play your 
                         pianoforte?

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Of course, yes--my goodness. We do 
                         not stand on ceremony here, my dear.

               For once, ELINOR is grateful for her sister's rudeness as 
               everyone rises and follows MARIANNE out.

               EXT. BARTON PARK - FRONT STEPS - EVE

               A soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is 
               dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE's 
               song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression 
               of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes.

               INT. BARTON PARK - MUSIC ROOM - EVE

               Everyone watches MARIANNE as she plays and sings. Behind 
               them we see BRANDON entering. But he stays in the shadow of 
               the door and no one notices him. CLOSE on his face. He gazes 
               at MARIANNE with an unfathomable look of grief and longing. 
               He breathes in deeply. Suddenly, ELINOR feels his presence 
               and looks around at him. After a few moments, she turns back, 
               slightly puzzled. The song finishes. Everyone claps. The MAN 
               ventures out into the light and SIR JOHN springs from his 
               seat.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Brandon! Where have you been? Come, 
                         come and meet our beautiful new 
                         neighbours!

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         What a pity you are late, Colonel! 
                         You have missed the most delightful 
                         singing!

               BRANDON bows to the company and smiles slightly.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         A great pity, indeed.

               ELINOR looks at him, even more puzzled.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear 
                         friend Colonel Brandon? We served 
                         together in the East Indies and I 
                         assure you there is no better fellow 
                         on earth--

                                     MARGARET
                         Have you really been to the East 
                         Indies, Colonel?

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I have.

                                     MARGARET
                         What is it like?

               MARGARET is quivering with fascination.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Like? Hot.

               But COLONEL BRANDON knows what MARGARET wants to hear.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                              (mysteriously)
                         The air is full of spices.

               MARGARET smiles with satisfaction.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn 
                         to entertain us!

                                     ELINOR
                         Oh no, Sir John, I do not--

                                     SIR JOHN
                         --and I think we can all guess what 
                         key you will sing in!

               SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are bursting with their new joke.

                                     SIR JOHN/MRS JENNINGS
                         F major!

               They fall about.

               INT. SIR JOHN'S CARRIAGE - NIGHT

               The DASHWOODS are returning home. A row is in progress.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (to Margaret)
                         As for you, you have no right, no 
                         right at all, to parade your ignorant 
                         assumptions--

                                     MARGARET
                         They are not assumptions. You told 
                         me.

               ELINOR stares at MARIANNE. MARIANNE colours and attacks 
               MARGARET again.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I told you nothing--

                                     MARGARET
                         They'll meet him when he comes, 
                         anyway.

                                     MARIANNE
                         That is not the point. You do not 
                         speak of such things before strangers--

                                     MARGARET
                         But everyone else was--

                                     MARIANNE
                         Mrs Jennings is not everyone.

                                     MARGARET
                         I like her! She talks about things. 
                         We never talk about things.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Hush, please, now that is enough, 
                         Margaret. If you cannot think of 
                         anything appropriate to say, you 
                         will please restrict your remarks to 
                         the weather.

               A heated pause.

                                     MARGARET
                         I like Colonel Brandon too. He's 
                         been to places.

               EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - DAY

               In the background, SIR JOHN, ELINOR and MRS JENNINGS pack 
               the remains of a picnic into a basket. MRS DASHWOOD and 
               MARGARET examine a foxhole. In the foreground, MARIANNE is 
               cutting bulrushes for basketwork. Her knife is blunt and she 
               saws impatiently.

               COLONEL BRANDON materialises at her side and wordlessly offers 
               her his hunting knife. Oddly nervous, MARIANNE takes it. She 
               turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease. The 
               COLONEL's gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet.

               INT. KEEPER'S LODGE - BARTON PARK - DAY

               SIR JOHN and BRANDON are cleaning their guns in companionable 
               silence--a habit left over from army days. SIR JOHN eyes 
               BRANDON roguishly.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         You know what they're saying, of 
                         course...

               No answer.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         The word is that you have developed 
                         a taste for--certain company.

               BRANDON stays resolutely silent. SIR JOHN is emboldened.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         And why not, say I. A man like you--
                         in his prime--she'd be a most 
                         fortunate young lady--

               BRANDON cuts across him.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Marianne Dashwood would no more think 
                         of me than she would of you, John.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Brandon, my boy, do not think of 
                         yourself so meanly--

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         And all the better for her.

               SIR JOHN subsides. BRANDON is clearly as angry with himself 
               as he is with SIR JOHN.

               EXT. POND NEAR BARTON PARK - ANOTHER DAY

               BRANDON strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one 
               arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between 
               its jaws. The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then 
               stops. He stands for a moment deep in thought. Then he takes 
               his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively.

               EXT. BARTON PARK - GARDENS - DAY

               An outdoor luncheon is in progress. COLONEL BRANDON is talking 
               to MRS DASHWOOD. Occasionally he looks over towards MARIANNE, 
               who is playing bilboquet with SIR JOHN and MARGARET. MRS 
               JENNINGS nudges ELINOR hard and gestures to BRANDON.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                              (stage whisper)
                         Besotted! Excellent match, for he is 
                         rich and she is handsome.

                                     ELINOR
                         How long have you known the Colonel?

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever 
                         I have been here, and I came fifteen 
                         years back. His estate at Delaford 
                         is but four miles hence and he and 
                         John are very thick. He has no wife 
                         or children of his own, for--

               MRS JENNINGS lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         --he has a tragic history. He loved 
                         a girl once--twenty years ago now--a 
                         ward to his family, but they were 
                         not permitted to marry...

               ELINOR is intrigued.

                                     ELINOR
                         On what grounds?

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Money. Eliza was poor. When the father 
                         discovered their amour, she was flung 
                         out of the house and he packed off 
                         into the army. I believe he would 
                         have done himself a harm if not for 
                         John...

                                     ELINOR
                         What became of the lady?

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Oh, she was passed from man to man--
                         disappeared from all good society. 
                         When Brandon got back from India he 
                         searched for heaven knows how long, 
                         only to find her dying in a poor 
                         house. You have seen how it has 
                         affected him. Once I thought my 
                         daughter Charlotte might have cheered 
                         him up, but she is much better off 
                         where she is.

               ELINOR is silent with amazement at this unexpected history.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Look at him now, though. So attentive. 
                         I shall try an experiment on him.

                                     ELINOR
                         Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings, 
                         leave the poor Colonel alone.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         No, no, it is just the thing--all 
                         suitors need a little help, my dear

               MRS JENNINGS winks at ELINOR and rubs her hands as though 
               about to perform a magic trick.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                              (trillingly)
                         Colonel Brandon!

               BRANDON looks up.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         We have not heard you play for us of 
                         late!

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         For the simple reason that you have 
                         a far superior musician here.

               He indicates MARIANNE, who smiles absently.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Perhaps you did not know, Miss 
                         Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares 
                         your passion for music and plays the 
                         piano forte very well.

               MARIANNE looks at BRANDON in some surprise.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Play us a duet!

               BRANDON looks at MRS JENNINGS warningly but she ignores him.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I'll trow you know quite as many 
                         melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!

               Her tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Come! Let us see you both side by 
                         side!

               MARIANNE rises impatiently.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I do not know any duets. Forgive me, 
                         Colonel.

               She moves away. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - LATE AFTERNOON

               The DASHWOODS returning. MARIANNE is taking her bonnet off 
               so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and 
               tighter. Despite them selves, ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are 
               amused.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Oh! Are we never to have a moment's 
                         peace? The rent here may be low but 
                         I think we have it on very hard terms.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with 
                         a married daughter--she has nothing 
                         to do but marry off everyone else's.

               BETSY pokes her head out from the dining room.

                                     BETSY
                         There's a parcel arrived for you, 
                         Miss Dashwood!

                                     MARGARET
                         A parcel!

               They all crowd into the dining room to find a large package 
               on the table, which MARGARET is permitted to open. In the 
               meantime ELINOR comes to the rescue with the bonnet and 
               MARIANNE stands shifting like a spirited mare as ELINOR 
               patiently unravels the knot.

                                     MARIANNE
                         It is too ridiculous! When is a man 
                         to be safe from such wit if age and 
                         infirmity do not protect him?

                                     ELINOR
                         Infirmity!

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I 
                         am at death's door.

                                     ELINOR
                         It is a miracle your life has extended 
                         this far...

                                     MARIANNE
                         Did you not hear him complain of a 
                         rheumatism in his shoulder?

                                     ELINOR
                         A slight ache' I believe was his 
                         phrase...

               MARIANNE smiles and ELINOR laughs at her. Then MARGARET opens 
               the parcel to reveal--her atlas. The atmosphere alters 
               immediately as MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE look at ELINOR in 
               consternation.

                                     MARGARET
                         But Edward said he would bring it 
                         himself.

               There is a letter on top of the atlas. CLOSE on the address 
               'To the Dashwoods'. MRS DASHWOOD picks it up, looks at ELINOR, 
               and opens

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         'Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood, 
                         Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret--
                         it gives me great pleasure to restore 
                         this atlas to its rightful owner. 
                         Alas, business in London does not 
                         permit me to accompany it, although 
                         this is likely to hurt me far more 
                         than it hurts you. For the present 
                         my memories of your kindness must be 
                         enough to sustain me, and I remain 
                         your devoted servant always. E. C. 
                         Ferrars.'

               A silence greets this brief epistle. ELINOR struggles to 
               contain her bitter disappointment.

                                     MARGARET
                         But why hasn't he come?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         He says he is busy, dear.

                                     MARGARET
                         He said he'd come.

               MARGARET is genuinely upset. ELINOR quietly hangs up 
               MARIANNE's bonnet.

                                     MARGARET
                         Why hasn't he come?

               MRS DASHWOOD looks beseechingly at MARIANNE, who nods and 
               grasps MARGARET's hand.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I am taking you for a walk.

                                     MARGARET
                         No! I've been a walk.

                                     MARIANNE
                         You need another.

                                     MARGARET
                         It is going to rain.

               MARIANNE shoves her bonnet back on and drags MARGARET out.

                                     MARIANNE
                         It is not going to rain.

                                     MARGARET
                         You always say that and then it always 
                         does.

               We hear the front door slam behind them. There is a short 
               silence.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         I fear Mrs Jennings is a bad 
                         influence.

               She approaches ELINOR.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         You must miss him, Elinor.

               ELINOR looks very directly at her mother.

                                     ELINOR
                         We are not engaged, Mamma.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         But he loves you, dearest, of that I 
                         am certain.

               ELINOR looks down. She speaks slowly, choosing her words 
               with care.

                                     ELINOR
                         I am by no means assured of his regard 
                         for me.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Oh, Elinor!

                                     ELINOR
                         But even were he to feel such a... 
                         preference, I think we should be 
                         foolish to assume that there would 
                         not be many obstacles to his choosing 
                         a woman of no rank who cannot afford 
                         to buy sugar...

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         But Elinor--your heart must tell you--

                                     ELINOR
                         In such a situation, Mamma, it is 
                         perhaps better to use one's head.

               She clears her throat, rises determinedly, picks up the 
               accounts book and opens it. MRS DASHWOOD is silenced.

               EXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

               MARIANNE walks very briskly, dragging an unwilling MARGARET 
               behind her.

               EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

               It has started to rain. Mists are gathering around the two 
               figures walking against the wind.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Is there any felicity in the world 
                         superior to this?

                                     MARGARET
                         I told you it would rain.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Look! There is some blue sky! Let us 
                         chase it!

                                     MARGARET
                         I'm not supposed to run.

               MARIANNE runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist. 
               MARGARET stumbles after her, grumbling. We follow MARIANNE 
               in her headlong descent and suddenly, dramatically, she trips 
               and sprawls to the ground, letting out a sharp cry of pain.

                                     MARGARET
                         Marianne!

                                     MARIANNE
                         Help me!

               She tries to get up, but the pain in her ankle is too great. 
               She sinks back to the ground. MARGARET is very alarmed.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Margaret, run home and fetch help.

               The mists have thickened. They can no longer see where they 
               are. Despite her rising fear, MARGARET squares her shoulders 
               bravely and tries to sense the direction.

                                     MARGARET
                         I think it is this way. I will run 
                         as fast as I can, Marianne.

               She dashes off. As she goes into the mist we hear the thunder 
               of hooves.

               CU Margaret's terrified expression. They seem to be coming 
               from all around. She wheels and turns and then--Crash! Through 
               the mist breaks a huge white horse. Astride sits an Adonis 
               in hunting gear. MARGARET squeals. The horse rears. Its rider 
               controls it and slides off. He rushes to MARIANNE's side.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         Are you hurt?

                                     MARIANNE
                              (transfixed)
                         Only my ankle.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         May I have your permission to--

               He indicates her leg. Decorous, perhaps faintly impish.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         --ascertain if there are any breaks?

               MARIANNE nods speechlessly. With great delicacy, he feels 
               her ankle. MARGARET's eyes are out on chapel-hooks. MARIANNE 
               almost swoons with embarrassment and excitement mixed.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         It is not broken. Now, can you put 
                         your arm about my neck?

               MARIANNE does not need any encouragement. He lifts her 
               effortlessly and calls to his horse: 'Bedivere!' It trots 
               obediently forward. The STRANGER smiles down at MARIANNE.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         Allow me to escort you home.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               Rain is thudding against the window from which MRS DASHWOOD 
               turns, looking very worried.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Marianne was sure it would not rain.

                                     ELINOR
                         Which invariably means it will.

               But we can see she is trying to conceal her anxiety from her 
               mother. There are noises in the hall.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         At last!

               MARGARET runs into the room dripping wet.

                                     MARGARET
                         She fell over! She fell down--and 
                         he's carrying her!

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

               MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR rush to the front door. They see the 
               STRANGER carrying MARIANNE up the garden path, his scarlet 
               coat staining the monochrome rain.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Marianne!

               The STRANGER reaches the door. This is no time for 
               introductions.

                                     ELINOR
                         In here, sir--this way. Margaret, 
                         open the door wider. Please, sir, 
                         lay her here. Marianne, are you in 
                         pain?

               They move into the parlour.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               MARIANNE is carried in, surrounded by ELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD 
               and MARGARET.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         It is a twisted ankle.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Do not be alarmed, Mamma.

               The STRANGER deposits MARIANNE on the sofa. They look straight 
               into each other's eyes. Electric.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         I can assure you it is not serious. 
                         I took the liberty of feeling the 
                         bone and it is perfectly sound.

               ELINOR raises her eyebrows at MARIANNE, who blushes to her 
               roots.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Sir, I cannot even begin to thank 
                         you.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         Please do not think of it. I'm 
                         honoured of be of service.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Will you not be seated?

                                     THE STRANGER
                         Pray excuse me--I have no desire to 
                         leave a water mark! But permit me to 
                         call tomorrow afternoon and inquire 
                         after the patient?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         We shall look forward to it!

               He turns to MARIANNE and smiles. She smiles back gloriously. 
               He bows, and sweeps out of the room.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (hissing)
                         His name! His name!

               MRS DASHWOOD silences her with a gesture and follows him out 
               with all the solicitous charm she can command while MARGARET 
               pokes her head around the door to watch. ELINOR is removing 
               MARIANNE's boot and trying not to laugh at her.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

               MRS DASHWOOD calls out after him.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Please tell us to whom we are so 
                         much obliged?

               The STRANGER mounts Bedivere and turns to her.

                                     THE STRANGER
                         John Willoughby of Allenham--your 
                         servant, ma'am!

               And he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere 
               to sprout wings. CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD's excited expression.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               MRS DASHWOOD runs back into the parlour, jittering with 
               excitement and anxiety.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Mr John Willoughby of Allenham!

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         What an impressive gentleman!

                                     MARIANNE
                         He lifted me as if I weighed no more 
                         than a dried leaf!

                                     ELINOR
                         Is he human?

               MARIANNE hits ELINOR. MRS DASHWOOD tends to her ankle.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Tell me if I hurt you.

                                     ELINOR
                              (regarding Marianne's 
                              ecstatic expression)
                         She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret, 
                         ask Betsy to make up a cold compress, 
                         please.

                                     MARGARET
                              (leaving reluctantly)
                         Did you see him? He expressed himself 
                         well, did he not?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         With great decorum and honour.

                                     MARIANNE
                         And spirit and wit and feeling.

                                     ELINOR
                         And economy--ten words at most.

               From below stairs we can hear MARGARET wailing Wait for me!

                                     MARIANNE
                         And he is to come tomorrow!

                                     ELINOR
                         You must change, Marianne--you will 
                         catch a cold.

                                     MARIANNE
                         What care I for colds when there is 
                         such a man?

                                     ELINOR
                         You will care very much when your 
                         nose swells up.

                                     MARIANNE
                         You are right. Help me, Elinor.

               MARGARET comes back with the bandages.

                                     MARGARET
                         What has happened?

                                     ELINOR
                         We have decided to give you to the 
                         Gypsies.

               ELINOR and MARIANNE go upstairs. MARGARET whispers to MRS 
               DASHWOOD.

                                     MARGARET
                         Will they be married before Edward 
                         and Elinor, do you think, Mamma?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Margaret, you are worse than Mrs 
                         Jennings.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - MORNING

               The rain has cleared. SIR JOHN's horse munches grass 
               contentedly by the side of the road.

                                     SIR JOHN (V.O.)
                         Mr Willoughby is well worth catching, 
                         Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must 
                         not expect to have all the men to 
                         herself!

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - MORNING

               The DASHWOODS are having a frustrating time winkling 
               information about WILLOUGHBY out of SIR JOHN, who is in turn 
               only anxious to protect BRANDON's interest. MARIANNE has her 
               bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience.

                                     MARIANNE
                         But what do you know of Mr Willoughby, 
                         Sir John?

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Decent shot--and there is not a bolder 
                         rider in all England.

                                     MARIANNE
                         But what is he like?

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Like?

                                     MARIANNE
                         What are his tastes? His passions? 
                         His pursuits?

                                     SIR JOHN
                              (mystified)
                         Well, he has the nicest little bitch 
                         of a pointer--was she out with him 
                         yesterday?

               MARIANNE gives up. MRS DASHWOOD takes over.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Where is Allenham, Sir John?

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Nice little estate three miles east. 
                         He is to inherit it from an elderly 
                         relative--Lady Allen is her name.

               Now they are getting somewhere. MARIANNE is about to ask 
               another question when they hear a horse galloping up. Everyone 
               is electrified. MARGARET runs to the window and turns back 
               in disappointment.

                                     MARGARET
                         It is Colonel Brandon. I shall go 
                         outside and keep watch.

               MARGARET runs out of the room.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         You are all on the lookout for 
                         Willoughby, eh? Dear me, poor Brandon. 
                         You will none of you think of him 
                         now.

               BRANDON is admitted by BETSY. He is carrying a large bunch 
               of hothouse flowers.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         How is the invalid?

               He hands MARIANNE the flowers with a smile.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Thank you so much, Colonel.

               She rather absently hands the flowers to ELINOR, who goes 
               for a vase. SIR JOHN gestures at BRANDON with bluff 
               insensitivity.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Miss Marianne, I cannot see why you 
                         should set your cap at Mr Willoughby 
                         when you have already made such a 
                         splendid conquest!

                                     MARIANNE
                         I have no intention of 'setting my 
                         cap' at anyone, Sir John!

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Mr Willoughby--Lady Allen's nephew?

               BRANDON's light tone betrays no emotion. ELINOR comes back 
               in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to 
               MARIANNE.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Aye, he visits every year for he is 
                         to inherit Allenham--and he has a 
                         very pretty estate of his own, Miss 
                         Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset. 
                         If I were you, I would not give him 
                         up to my younger sister in spite of 
                         all this tumbling down hills.

               Suddenly MARGARET runs in screaming 'Marianne's preserver!' 
               at the top of her voice. Everyone starts to move at once. 
               MARGARET is silenced. BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, whose 
               incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         Here is the man himself. Come, Brandon--
                         we know when we are not wanted. Let 
                         us leave him to the ladies!

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne! Sir John and the Colonel 
                         are leaving.

               MARIANNE looks up, suddenly self-conscious.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Goodbye, Colonel. Thank you for the 
                         flowers.

               ELINOR sees them out. We hear WILLOUGHBY's voice outside. 
               CLOSE on MARIANNE's radiant anticipation.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

               WILLOUGHBY is shaking hands with COLONEL BRANDON and SIR 
               JOHN.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         How do you do, Colonel?

                                     SIR JOHN
                         How does he do? How do you do, more 
                         like. Go on in, they're waiting for 
                         you!

               BRANDON looks at WILLOUGHBY for a moment. He bows. WILLOUGHBY 
               bows. Then BRANDON and SIR JOHN exit.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               ELINOR leads in WILLOUGHBY. MRS DASHWOOD greets him with 
               outstretched arms.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Mr Willoughby! What a pleasure to 
                         see you again!

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         The pleasure is all mine, I can 
                         asstire you. I trust Miss Marianne 
                         has not caught cold?

                                     MARIANNE
                         You have found out my name!

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Of course. The neighbourhood is 
                         crawling with my spies.

               He suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his 
               back and offers them to MARIANNE with a courtly, humorous 
               bow.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         And since you cannot venture out to 
                         nature, nature must be brought to 
                         you!

                                     MARIANNE
                         How beautiful. These are not from 
                         the hothouse.

               WILLOUGHBY sees BRANDON's flowers.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Ah! I see mine is not the first 
                         offering, nor the most elegant. I am 
                         afraid I obtained these from an 
                         obliging field.

                                     MARIANNE
                         But I have always preferred wild 
                         flowers!

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         I suspected as much.

               ELINOR takes the delicate flowers from WILLOUGHBY.

                                     ELINOR
                         I will put these in water.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is 
                         beyond expression--

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         But it is I who am grateful. I have 
                         often passed this cottage and grieved 
                         for its lonely state--and then the 
                         first news I had from Lady Allen 
                         when I arrived was that it was taken. 
                         I felt a peculiar interest in the 
                         event which nothing can account for 
                         but my present delight in meeting 
                         you.

               He is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. ELINOR 
               brings back WILLOUGHBY's flowers and places them next to 
               BRANDON's on the side table.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby.

               She indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying on 
               MARIANNE's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight--
               sits down on the stool at her feet.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?

               Everyone answers at once.

                                     MARIANNE/ELINOR/MRS DASHWOOD
                         I am. / We all are. / Marianne.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Marianne has been reading them out 
                         to us.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Which are your favourites?

               It is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers it.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Without a doubt, mine is 116.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Let me not to the marriage of true 
                         minds Admit impediments. Love is not 
                         love Which alters when it alteration 
                         finds, Or bends with the remover to 
                         remove--then how does it go?

                                     MARIANNE
                         '0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.'

               WILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and continues. 
               ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances. Clearly, their 
               contribution to this conversation will be minimal.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         'That looks on storms'--or is it 
                         tempests? Let me find it.

               WILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         It is strange you should be reading 
                         them--for, look, I carry this with 
                         me always.

               It is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted, 
               and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, 
               they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though 
               they were already intimates.

               MRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR, 
               amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and 
               MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY

               WILLOUGHBY is leaving. He has a flower from MARIANNE's bunch 
               in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile 
               as his horse. Everyone has come out to say goodbye, MARIANNE 
               supported by ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets 
                         are yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman 
                         against further injury!

                                     MARIANNE
                         Goodbye! Thank you!

               He gallops off. They all wave. MARGARET follows him down the 
               road for a while.

                                     ELINOR
                         Good work, Marianne! You have covered 
                         all forms of poetry; another meeting 
                         will ascertain his views on nature 
                         and romantic attachments and then 
                         you will have nothing left to talk 
                         about and the acquaintanceship will 
                         be over.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I suppose I have erred against 
                         decorum. I should have been dull and 
                         spiritless and talked only of the 
                         weather, or the state of the roads.

                                     ELINOR
                         No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no 
                         doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Why should he doubt it? Why should I 
                         hide my regard?

                                     ELINOR
                         No particular reason, Marianne, only 
                         that we know so little of him--

                                     MARIANNE
                         But time alone does not determine 
                         intimacy. Seven years would be 
                         insufficient to make some people 
                         acquainted with each other and seven 
                         days are more than enough for others.

                                     ELINOR
                         Or seven hours in this case.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I feel I know Mr Willoughby well 
                         already. If I had weaker, more shallow 
                         feelings perhaps I could conceal 
                         them, as you do--

               Then she realises what she's said.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Marianne, that is not fair--

                                     MARIANNE
                         I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean

                                     ELINOR
                         I know. Do not trouble yourself, 
                         Marianne.

               ELINOR turns back into the house.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I do not understand her, Mamma. Why 
                         does she never mention Edward? I 
                         have never even seen her cry about 
                         him, or about Norland.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or 
                         I, dear. She does not like to be 
                         swayed by her emotions.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               CLOSE on Edward's handkerchief. We can see the monogram ECF 
               clearly.

               CLOSE on ELINOR staring out of the window. Tears stand in 
               her eyes but she presses the handkerchief to them before 
               they fall.

               INT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE

               After dinner. Tea has been served. ELINOR, COLONEL BRANDON, 
               MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS play at cards. In a far corner 
               of the room, MARIANNE is concentrating as she draws a 
               silhouette.

               WILLOUGHBY's profile glows behind the screen in front of 
               her, She looks up and stops, gazing, bewitched, at his beauty. 
               The lips move--a whisper: Marianne. Then, louder: Haven't 
               you finished? He moves out from behind the screen, eyes full 
               of laughter. They look at each other.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are at the accounts. WILLOUGHBY and 
               MARIANNE are on the other side of the room in the window 
               seat, whispering together. Clearly, he is already part of 
               the family.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Surely you are not going to deny us 
                         beef as well as sugar?

                                     ELINOR
                         There is nothing under tenpence a 
                         pound. We have to economise.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Do you want us to starve?

                                     ELINOR
                         No. Just not to eat beef.

               MRS DASHWOOD is silenced but sighs crossly. ELINOR looks 
               over to the lovers and sees WILLOUGHBY in the act of cutting 
               off a lock of MARIANNE's hair, which he kisses and places in 
               his pocket-book. ELINOR is transfixed by this strangely erotic 
               moment. WILLOUGHBY senses her gaze and looks over. She snaps 
               her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she 
               has written 'Edward' at the top of the sheet. Hastily she 
               rubs it out and writes 'Expenses'.

               EXT. BARTON CHURCH. DAY.

               MRS JENNINGS is talking to the elderly CURATE. Other 
               PARISHIONERS exit the church as WILLOUGHBY's curricle (the 
               eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying 
               by. MARIANNE sits by his side, the picture of happiness. MRS 
               JENNINGS nudges the CURATE and whispers. The PARISHIONERS 
               stare after them and comment to each other.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY

               MARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together. 
               MARIANNE is dressed to go out. The argument has evidently 
               started indoors and is being continued here.

                                     MARIANNE
                         If there was any true impropriety in 
                         my behaviour, I should be sensible 
                         of it, Elinor--

                                     ELINOR
                         But as it has already exposed you to 
                         some very impertinent remarks, do 
                         you not begin to doubt your own 
                         discretion?

                                     MARIANNE
                         If the impertinent remarks of such 
                         as Mrs Jennings are proof of 
                         impropriety, then we are all offending 
                         every moment of our lives--

               The conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL BRANDON 
               on horseback.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                              (dismounting)
                         Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne!

                                     ELINOR
                         Good morning, Colonel!

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I come to issue an invitation. A 
                         picnic on my estate at Delaford--if 
                         you would care to join us on Thursday 
                         next. Mrs Jennings's daughter and 
                         her husband are traveling up 
                         especially.

                                     ELINOR
                         Thank you, Colonel, we shall be 
                         delighted.

               At that moment, WILLOUGHBY's curricle hoves into view and 
               MARIANNE's face lights up.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                              (to Marianne)
                         I will of course be including Mr 
                         Willoughby in the party.

               Even MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects her 
               manners. She smiles kindly at BRANDON.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I should be delighted to join you, 
                         Colonel!

               The COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods 
               with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good 
                         morning, Colonel.

                                     MARIANNE
                         The Colonel has invited us to 
                         Delaford, Willoughby!

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Excellent. I understand you have a 
                         particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.

               The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         A Broadwood Grand.

                                     MARIANNE
                         A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really 
                         be able to play for you!

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         We shall look forward to it!

               MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up 
               the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells.

               BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then 
               collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than 
               satisfied with their behaviour.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Your sister seems very happy.

                                     ELINOR
                         Yes. Marianne does not approve of 
                         hiding her emotions. In fact, her 
                         romantic prejudices have the 
                         unfortunate tendency to set propriety 
                         at naught.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         She is wholly unspoilt.

                                     ELINOR
                         Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The 
                         sooner she becomes acquainted with 
                         the ways of the world, the better.

               COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very 
               deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I knew a lady like your sister--the 
                         same impulsive sweetness of temper--
                         who was forced into, as you put it, 
                         a better acquaintance with the world. 
                         The result was only ruination and 
                         despair.

               He stops, and briskly remounts his horse.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.

               EXT. BARTON PARK - DRIVE - DAY

               People and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the 
               atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising 
               the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON 
               is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are 
               three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a 
               stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking 
               GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE, 
               MARGARET, MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD.

               MARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the 
               road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood, 
                         when Charlotte and her lord and master 
                         appeared with our cousin Lucy! The 
                         last person I expected to see! 'Where 
                         did you pop out from, Miss?' says I. 
                         I was never so surprised to see anyone 
                         in all my life!

               LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground. MRS JENNINGS 
               continues sotto voce to MRS DASHWOOD.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         She probably came on purpose to share 
                         the fun, for there are no funds for 
                         such luxuries at home, poor thing.

                                     LUCY
                         I had not seen you for so long, dear 
                         Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the 
                         opportunity.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses 
                         Dashwood she wanted to see, not 
                         Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing 
                         but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood 
                         that' for I don't know how long! And 
                         what do you think of them now you do 
                         see them, Lucy? My mother has talked 
                         of nothing else in her letters since 
                         you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr 
                         Palmer--are they not the very 
                         creatures she describes?

               MR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted 
               expression.

                                     MR PALMER
                         Nothing like.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (laughing gaily)
                         Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are 
                         quite rude today? He is to be an MP, 
                         you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is 
                         very fatiguing for him for he is 
                         forced to make everybody like him--
                         he says it is quite shocking--

                                     MRS PALMER
                         I never said anything so irrational. 
                         Don't palm all your abuses of the 
                         language upon me.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                              (to Mrs Dashwood)
                         Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always 
                         out of humour.

               MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege. 
               WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves 
               to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE 
               and points to MARIANNE.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Here he is! Now you shall see, 
                         Charlotte.

               WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making 
               her laugh.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         How now, Mr Willoughby! You must 
                         greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr 
                         Palmer--

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         How do you do?

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         And my little cousin, Miss Lucy 
                         Steele.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Welcome to our party, Miss Steele!

               LUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely, 
               leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS 
               coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know Mr Willoughby extremely well--
                         not that I ever spoke to him but I 
                         have seen him forever in town. Your 
                         sister is monstrous lucky to get 
                         him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is 
                         in love with her as well, which is a 
                         very great compliment for he hardly 
                         ever falls in love with anyone.

               ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to 
               the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs 
               with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR.

                                     LUCY
                         May I beg a seat beside you, Miss 
                         Dashwood? I have so longed to make 
                         your better acquaintance! I have 
                         heard nothing but the highest praise 
                         for you.

               ELINOR is relieved to change the subject.

                                     ELINOR
                         I would be delighted. But Sir John 
                         and Mrs Jennings are too excessive 
                         in their compliments. I am sure to 
                         disappoint.

                                     LUCY
                         No, for it was from quite another 
                         source that I heard you praised and 
                         one not at all inclined to 
                         exaggeration.

               LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though 
               not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN 
               thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face 
               the new arrival.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         What can this be?

               It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride. 
               He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which 
               BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed 
               curiosity.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         My horse! Quickly!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         What is the matter, Brandon?

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I must away to London.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         No! Impossible!

               Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified. 
               A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Imperative.

               There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN 
               is embarrassed and protests again.

                                     SIR JOHN
                         But Brandon, we are all assembled. 
                         We cannot picnic at Delaford without 
                         our host! Go up to town tomorrow.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Or wait till we return and start 
                         then--you would not be six hours 
                         later.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I cannot afford to lose one minute.

               As he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency 
               silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone 
               stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start 
               to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR.

                                     LUCY
                         Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it! 
                         Just when I was to have the 
                         opportunity of speaking with you.

               EXT. MEADOW NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

               Having been denied their trip, the DASHWOODS and WILLOUGHBY 
               have set out an impromptu picnic. WILLOUGHBY is wandering 
               restlessly about.

               The weather is sublime.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Frailty, thy name is Brandon!

                                     MARIANNE
                         There are some people who cannot 
                         bear a party of pleasure. I think he 
                         wrote the letter himself as a trick 
                         for getting out of it.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                              (indulgently)
                         You are a very wicked pair, Colonel 
                         Brandon will be sadly missed.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Why? When he is the kind of man that 
                         everyone speaks well of and no one 
                         wants to talk to.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Exactly!

                                     ELINOR
                         Nonsense.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Colonel Brandon is very highly 
                         esteemed at the Park.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Which is enough censure in itself.

                                     ELINOR
                              (half laughing)
                         Really, Willoughby!

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                              (imitating Mrs Jennings 
                              perfectly)
                         Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you 
                         and your wicked ways--oh!

               He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing 
               her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her 
               shoulder.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your 
                         beau, reveal him, I say! Let's have 
                         no secrets between friends! Let me 
                         winkle them out of you!

               ELINOR hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles 
               off to MARIANNE.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                              (as Mrs Jennings)
                         I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do 
                         not have you married to the Colonel 
                         by teatime, I shall swallow my own 
                         bonnet.

               MARIANNE laughs. WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         As if you could marry such a 
                         character.

                                     ELINOR
                         Why should you dislike him?

               There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBY's raillery. He flicks 
               ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps MARIANNE to 
               her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Because he has threatened me with 
                         rain when I wanted it fine, he has 
                         found fault with the balance of my 
                         curricle and I cannot persuade him 
                         to buy my brown mare. If it will be 
                         of any satisfaction to you, however, 
                         to be told I believe his character 
                         to be in all other respects 
                         irreproachable, I am ready to confess 
                         it. And in return for an 
                         acknowledgement that must give me 
                         some pain.
                              (he is slowing down)
                         You cannot deny me the privilege...
                              (slower still)
                         of disliking him...
                              (and stopping)
                         as much as I adore...

               He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other. The 
               expression on WILLOUGHBY's face is heart-stopping. MARGARET 
               has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.

               ELINOR glances at MRS DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at them 
               with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE.

               Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away from 
               MARIANNE and gesturing to the house.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         --this cottage!

               The tension is broken. MARGARET starts to chew again.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         I have great plans for improvements 
                         to it, you know, Mr Willoughby.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Now that I will never consent to. 
                         Not a stone must be added to its 
                         walls. Were I rich enough, I would 
                         instantly pull down Combe Magna and 
                         build it up again in the exact image 
                         of that cottage!

                                     ELINOR
                         With dark, narrow stairs, a poky 
                         hall and a fire that smokes?

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Especially the fire that smokes! 
                         Then I might be as happy at Combe 
                         Magna as I have been at Barton.

               He looks at MARIANNE, who has gone to sit at her mother's 
               feet.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         But this place has one claim on my 
                         affection which no other can possibly 
                         share.

               MARIANNE is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like 
               an angel.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Promise me you will never change it.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         I do not have the heart.

                                     ELINOR
                         Or the money.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH AND GATE - DUSK

               MARIANNE is seeing WILLOUGHBY off.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Miss Marianne, will you--will you do 
                         me the honour of granting me an 
                         interview tomorrow--alone?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Willoughby, we are always alone!

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         But there is something very particular 
                         I should like to ask you.

               There is something about his formal tone that makes her feel 
               shy.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I 
                         may stay behind from church.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Thank you. Until tomorrow then--Miss 
                         Marianne.

               He mounts Bedivere and leaves. MARIANNE looks after him, her 
               eyes shining. He is coming to propose.

               EXT. LONDON TENEMENTS - NIGHT

               A district of extreme poverty, populated by the LOWLIFE of 
               LONDON: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all kinds. In 
               the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who 
               sway and reel into the night.

               A hooded HORSEMAN pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance 
               to a slum. He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows. 
               The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for 
               him. He strides inside.

               INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT

               Stepping over a supine BEGGAR at the foot of the stairs, the 
               HORSEMAN flings back his hood--it is BRANDON, hollow-eyed 
               and dropping with weariness. We follow him up the stairs to 
               a door which is opened by an OLDER WOMAN.

               INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

               He enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from 
               the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps. At the window 
               stands the slight figure of a VERY YOUNG WOMAN. She turns. 
               BRANDON reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an 
               expression of deep shock. We see her silhouette. She is 
               heavily pregnant. She bursts into tears and runs into his 
               arms.

               INT. BARTON CHURCH - DAY

               Amongst the small CONGREGATION listening to the sermon drone 
               on, we see the excited faces of ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS 
               DASHWOOD.

                                     MARGARET
                         Do you think he will kneel down when 
                         he asks her?

                                     ELINOR
                         Shhh!

                                     MARGARET
                              (with satisfaction)
                         They always kneel down.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY

               The DASHWOODS return from church to find THOMAS grooming 
               Bedivere at the garden gate. Their excitement mounts.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

               They all enter the cottage, talking nonsense loudly in order 
               to signal their presence. MARGARET giggles. Suddenly, MARIANNE 
               bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the 
               room opposite. ELINOR and MARGARET stand by the door in utter 
               consternation, while MRS DASH- WOOD goes to MARIANNE.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         What is wrong, my dearest?

               MARIANNE shakes her head and waves them away.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS DASHWOOD enter to find WILLOUGHBY 
               standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Willoughby! What is the matter?

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         I--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am 
                         sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has 
                         exercised the privilege of riches 
                         upon a dependent cousin and is sending 
                         me to London.

               He cannot look any of them in the eye.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         When--this morning?

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Almost this moment.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         How very disappointing! But your 
                         business will not detain you from us 
                         for long, I hope?

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         You are very kind--but I have no 
                         idea of returning immediately to 
                         Devonshire. I am seldom invited to 
                         Allenham more than once a year.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait 
                         for an invitation from Barton Cottage?

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         My engagements at present are of 
                         such a nature--that is--I dare not 
                         flatter myself--

               The atmosphere is thick with tension. WILLOUGHBY flicks a 
               glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute astonishment.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         It is folly to linger in this manner. 
                         I will not torment myself further.

               He rushes past them and out of the cottage. They follow him 
               to the door.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

               The DASHWOODS cluster round the door.

                                     MARGARET
                         Willoughby, come back!

               She is silenced by ELINOR as WILLOUGHBY seizes Bedivere's 
               reins from THOMAS, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               They all rush back into the parlour.

                                     ELINOR
                         Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to 
                         make a cup of hot tea for Marianne.

               MARGARET nods dumbly and goes. MRS DASHWOOD has her arms 
               around MARIANNE.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         What is wrong, my love?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Nothing! Please do not ask me 
                         questions!

               MARIANNE struggles free.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Please let me be!

               She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming. 
               There is a moment of stunned silence.

                                     ELINOR
                         They must have quarreled.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         That is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady 
                         Allen--disapproves of his regard for 
                         Marianne and has invented an excuse 
                         to send him away?

                                     ELINOR
                         Then why did he not say as much? It 
                         is not like Willoughby to be 
                         secretive. Did he think Marianne was 
                         richer than she is?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         How could he?

               She gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with a 
               frown.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         What is it you suspect him of?

                                     ELINOR
                         I can hardly tell you. But why was 
                         his manner so guilty?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         What are you saying, Elinor? That he 
                         has been acting a part to your sister 
                         for all this time?

               MRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive. ELINOR pauses to think.

                                     ELINOR
                         No, he loves her, I am sure.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Of course he loves her!

                                     ELINOR
                         But has he left her with any assurance 
                         of his return? Cannot you ask her if 
                         he has proposed?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Certainly not. I cannot force a 
                         confidence from Marianne and nor 
                         must you. We must trust her to confide 
                         in us in her own time.

                                     ELINOR
                              (shaking her head)
                         There was something so underhand in 
                         the manner of his leaving.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         You are resolved, then, to think the 
                         worst of him.

                                     ELINOR
                         Not resolved--

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                              (cold)
                         I prefer to give him the benefit of 
                         my good opinion. He deserves no less. 
                         From all of us.

               She stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. ELINOR 
               follows her.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby--

               MRS DASHWOOD goes into her bedroom and shuts the door. ELINOR 
               is halfway up the stairs. She meets a wet-eyed MARGARET coming 
               down with a cup of tea.

                                     MARGARET
                         She would not let me in.

               ELINOR takes the cup and MARGARET runs out into the garden 
               in tears.

               The sound of sobbing also comes from MARIANNE's room, and 
               now from MRS DASHWOOD's as well. ELINOR sits down helplessly 
               on the stairs and drinks the tea.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - RAIN - DAY

               The rain has settled in. The cottage looks cold and bleak.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

               BETSY carries another uneaten meal from MARIANNE's room. She 
               looks at the food and tuts in anxiety.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               MARIANNE is sitting by the window looking out at the rain 
               through tear-swollen eyes. WILLOUGHBY's sonnets are on her 
               lap.

                                     MARIANNE
                         How like a winter hath my absence 
                         been from thee, the pleasure of the 
                         fleeting year! What freezings have I 
                         felt, what dark days seen! What old 
                         December's bareness everywhere!

               EXT. BARTON PARK - RAIN - EVE

               Smoke issues from every chimney in the place.

               INT. BARTON PARK - DRAWING ROOM - EVE

               Dinner is over. MARIANNE sits listlessly by the window. MR 
               PALMER is hiding behind a newspaper. SIR JOHN and MARGARET 
               are looking at a map and discussing routes through China. 
               LUCY, CHARLOTTE, MRS DASHWOOD and MRS JENNINGS are at cards. 
               ELINOR is reading.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh! If only this rain would stop!

                                     MR PALMER
                              (from behind the paper)
                         If only you would stop.

               MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE laugh at him.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         'Twas you took her off my hands, Mr 
                         Palmer, and a very good bargain you 
                         made of it too, but now I have the 
                         whip hand over you for you cannot 
                         give her back!

               The heavy silence behind the paper attests to the unhappy 
               truth of this statement.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Miss Marianne, come and play a round 
                         with us! Looking out at the weather 
                         will not bring him back.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (sotto voce)
                         She ate nothing at dinner.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Mind, we are all a little forlorn 
                         these days. London has swallowed all 
                         our company.

               CHARLOTTE and MRS JENNINGS start to gossip about the 
               disappearances of BRANDON and WILLOUGHBY. LUCY walks over 
               and sits by ELINOR, who politely puts aside the book.

                                     LUCY
                              (low)
                         Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now we 
                         might have our--discussion.

                                     ELINOR
                         Our discussion?

               LUCY looks around at MRS JENNINGS and lowers her voice still 
               further, so that ELINOR is obliged to move her chair nearer.

                                     LUCY
                         There is a particular question I 
                         have long wanted to ask you, but 
                         perhaps you will think me impertinent?

                                     ELINOR
                         I cannot imagine so.

                                     LUCY
                         But it is an odd question. Forgive 
                         me, I have no wish to trouble you--

               She looks away coyly as if deciding whether to speak.

                                     ELINOR
                         My dear Miss Steele--

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (interrupting)
                         Miss Dashwood, if only Mr Willoughby 
                         had gone home to Combe Magna, we 
                         could have taken Miss Marianne to 
                         see him! For we live but half a mile 
                         away.

                                     MR PALMER
                         Five and a half.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, I cannot believe it is that far, 
                         for you can see the place from the 
                         top of our hill. Is it really five 
                         and a half miles? No! I cannot believe 
                         it.

                                     MR PALMER
                         Try.

                                     ELINOR
                         You have my permission to ask any 
                         manner of question, if that is of 
                         any help.

                                     LUCY
                         Thank you. I wonder, are you at all 
                         acquainted with your sister-in-law's 
                         mother? Mrs Ferrars?

               ELINOR sits back in deep surprise.

                                     ELINOR
                         With Fanny's mother? No, I have never 
                         met her.

                                     LUCY
                         I am sure you think me strange for 
                         inquiring--if I dared tell--

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                              (shouting over)
                         If she tells you aught of the famous 
                         'Mr F', Lucy, you are to pass it on.

               ELINOR tries to ignore MRS JENNINGS, who is keeping a curious 
               eye on them.

                                     LUCY
                         Will you take a turn with me, Miss 
                         Dashwood?

               LUCY rises and takes ELINOR's arm. She guides her as far 
               away as possible from MRS JENNINGS and CHARLOTTE.

                                     ELINOR
                         I had no idea at all that you were 
                         connected with that family.

                                     LUCY
                         Oh! I am certainly nothing to Mrs 
                         Ferrars at present--but the time may 
                         come when we may be very intimately 
                         connected.

                                     ELINOR
                              (low)
                         What do you mean? Do you have an 
                         understanding with Fanny's brother 
                         Robert?

                                     LUCY
                         The youngest? No, I never saw him in 
                         my life. No, with Edward.

                                     ELINOR
                         Edward?

               ELINOR stops walking.

                                     ELINOR
                         Edward Ferrars?

               LUCY nods.

                                     LUCY
                         Edward and I have been secretly 
                         engaged these five years.

               ELINOR is frozen to the spot.

                                     LUCY
                         You may well be surprised. I should 
                         never have mentioned it, had I not 
                         known I could entirely trust you to 
                         keep our secret. Edward cannot mind 
                         me telling you for he looks on you 
                         quite as his own sister.

               ELINOR walks on mechanically. Disbelief has set in.

                                     ELINOR
                         I am sorry, but we surely--we cannot 
                         mean the same Mr Ferrars?

                                     LUCY
                         The very same--he was four years 
                         under the tutelage of my uncle Mr 
                         Pratt, down in Plymouth. Has he never 
                         spoken of it?

                                     ELINOR
                              (awareness dawning)
                         Mr Pratt! Yes, I believe he has.

                                     LUCY
                         I was very unwilling to enter into 
                         it without his mother's approval but 
                         we loved each other with too great a 
                         passion for prudence. Though you do 
                         nor know him so well as I, Miss 
                         Dashwood, you must have seen how 
                         capable he is of making a woman 
                         sincerely attached to him. I cannot 
                         pretend it has not been very hard on 
                         us both. We can hardly meet above 
                         twice a year.

               She sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds 
               to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ECF.

               ELINOR, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so 
               dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down.

                                     LUCY
                         You seem out of sorts, Miss Dashwood--
                         are you quite well?

                                     ELINOR
                         Perfectly well, thank you.

                                     LUCY
                         I have not offended you?

                                     ELINOR
                         On the contrary.

               MRS JENNINGS has been watching. Now she rises, unable to 
               contain herself.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I can stand it no longer, I must 
                         know what you are saying, Lucy! Miss 
                         Dashwood is quite engrossed!

               MRS JENNINGS starts to bear down on them. LUCY whispers with 
               real urgency.

                                     LUCY
                         Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds 
                         out, it will ruin him--you must not 
                         tell a soul! Edward says you would 
                         not break your word to save your 
                         life! Promise me!

               ECU on ELINOR's face.

                                     ELINOR
                         I give you my word.

               MRS JENNINGS looms over them.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Well, what can have fascinated you 
                         to such an extent, Miss Dashwood?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Tell us all!

               ELINOR cannot speak but LUCY glides smoothly in.

                                     LUCY
                         We were talking of London, ma'am, 
                         and all its--diversions.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Do you hear, Charlotte?

               MRS JENNINGS claps her hands delightedly.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         While you were so busy whispering, 
                         Charlotte and I have concocted a 
                         plan!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It is the best plan in the world.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I make for London shortly and I invite 
                         you, Lucy, and both the Misses 
                         Dashwood to join me!

               ELINOR cannot hide her dismay. MARIANNE springs from her 
               seat.

                                     MARIANNE
                         London!

                                     MARGARET
                         Oh, can I go! Can I go?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         You know perfectly well you are too 
                         young, dearest.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I shall convey you all to my house 
                         in Berkeley Street and we shall taste 
                         all the delights of the season--what 
                         say you?

                                     MARGARET
                         Oh, please can I go? I'm twelve soon.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Mr Palmer, do you not long to have 
                         the Misses Dashwood come to London?

                                     MR PALMER
                         I came into Devonshire with no other 
                         view.

               ELINOR exerts herself.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mrs Jennings, you are very kind, but 
                         we cannot possibly leave our mother...

               LUCY's calculating eyes turn to MRS DASHWOOD with alacrity.

                                     LUCY
                         Indeed, the loss would be too great.

               A chorus of objections goes up, particularly from MRS 
               DASHWOOD, who is both delighted and relieved to see MARIANNE 
               with a smile on her face.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Your mother can spare you very well.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Of course I can!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Of course she can!

                                     SIR JOHN
                         And look at Miss Marianne--it would 
                         break her heart to deny her!

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I will brook no refusal, Miss 
                         Dashwood!

               MARIANNE claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy. MRS 
               JENNINGS takes ELINOR's hand.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Let you and me strike hands upon the 
                         bargain--and if I do not have the 
                         three of you married by Christmas, 
                         it will not be my fault!

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - ELINOR/MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               We are in ELINOR and MARIANNE's bedroom. ELINOR is in bed. 
               She is lying on her side with her back to MARIANNE. We are 
               CLOSE on her face. MARIANNE is running around excitedly, 
               pulling out ribbons, looking at dresses, etc.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I was never so grateful in all my 
                         life as I am to Mrs Jennings. What a 
                         kind woman she is! I like her more 
                         than I can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall 
                         see Willoughby. Think how surprised 
                         he will be! And you will see Edward!

               ELINOR cannot reply.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Are you asleep?

                                     ELINOR
                         With you in the room?

               MARIANNE laughs.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I do not believe you feel as calm as 
                         you look, not even you, Elinor. I 
                         will never sleep tonight! Oh, what 
                         were you and Miss Steele whispering 
                         about so long?

               CLOSE on ELINOR's expression as she struggles with the 
               impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without 
               breaking her promise to LUCY. After a pause--

                                     ELINOR
                         Nothing of significance.

               MARIANNE looks at ELINOR curiously, then returns to her 
               packing.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY

               MRS DASHWOOD and MARGARET are waving MRS JENNINGS's carriage 
               off. MARIANNE waves back with such exuberance that she 
               practically falls out.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S CARRIAGE - ROAD TO LONDON - DAY

               MRS JENNINGS is chattering about London to MARIANNE, who 
               listens with new-found tolerance. LUCY is whispering into 
               ELINOR's ear.

                                     LUCY
                         I have written to Edward, Miss 
                         Dashwood, and yet I do not know how 
                         much I may see of him. Secrecy is 
                         vital--he will never be able to call.

                                     ELINOR
                         I should imagine not.

                                     LUCY
                         It is so hard. I believe my only 
                         comfort has been the constancy of 
                         his affection.

                                     ELINOR
                         You are fortunate, over such a lengthy 
                         engagement, never to have had any 
                         doubts on that score.

               LUCY looks at ELINOR sharply, but ELINOR is impassive.

                                     LUCY
                         Oh! I am of rather a jealous nature 
                         and if he had talked more of one 
                         young lady than any other... but he 
                         has never given a moment's alarm on 
                         that count.

               We can see from ELINOR's expression that she understands 
               LUCY perfectly. The strain around her eyes is pronounced.

                                     LUCY
                         Imagine how glad he will be to learn 
                         that we are friends!

               EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

               MRS JENNINGS's carriage trundles along.

               EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

               Establishing shot of a handsome town house. MRS JENNINGS's 
               carriage comes into shot and stops in front of it.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - DAY

               They enter the grand hallway under the supercilious gaze of 
               a powdered FOOTMAN (MR PIGEON). ELINOR is haggard after two 
               days of close proximity with LUCY. MRS JENNINGS is all 
               officious bustle and MARIANNE is feverish with anticipation. 
               She whispers to MRS JENNINGS, who laughs heartily.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         To be sure, my dear, you must just 
                         hand it to Pigeon there. He will 
                         take care of it.

               MARIANNE hands a letter to the sphinx-like FOOTMAN. We can 
               see a large W in the address. ELINOR looks at MARIANNE 
               inquiringly but MARIANNE moves away from her.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Lord above, you do not waste any 
                         time, Miss Marianne!

               MARIANNE glances self-consciously at ELINOR and follows MRS 
               JENNINGS upstairs. LUCY goes up to ELINOR and whispers.

                                     LUCY
                         A letter! So they are definitely 
                         engaged! Mrs Jennings says your sister 
                         will buy her wedding clothes here in 
                         town.

                                     ELINOR
                         Indeed Miss Steele, I know of no 
                         such plan.

               But ELINOR does not know what else to say. She marches firmly 
               upstairs.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               MARIANNE and ELINOR have changed from their traveling clothes 
               and are having a cup of tea. At least, ELINOR is. MARIANNE 
               is pacing up and down in front of the window.

                                     ELINOR
                         John and Fanny are in town. I think 
                         we shall be forced to see them.

               There is a faint knocking from somewhere. MARIANNE jumps.

                                     ELINOR
                         I think it was for next door.

               MARIANNE looks out of the window.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Yes, you are right.

               She sits down with a rueful smile. Suddenly a much louder 
               rap is heard and they both jump. We hear a bustling 
               downstairs. MARIANNE can hardly breathe. She goes to the 
               drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. We 
               hear a MAN's voice.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed 
                         it is!

               She turns and almost throws herself into the arms of COLONEL 
               BRANDON.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Oh! Excuse me, Colonel--

               She leaves the room hastily. ELINOR is so ashamed of 
               MARIANNE's rudeness that she does not at first notice 
               BRANDON's mood of tense distress.

                                     ELINOR
                         Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to 
                         see you! Have you been in London all 
                         this while?

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I have. How is your dear mother?

                                     ELINOR
                         Very well, thank you.

               Silence.

                                     ELINOR
                         Colonel, is there anything--

               But BRANDON interrupts her.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but I 
                         have heard reports through town... 
                         is it impossible to--but I could 
                         have no chance of succeeding--indeed 
                         I hardly know what to do. Tell me 
                         once and for all, is everything 
                         finally resolved between your sister 
                         and Mr Willoughby?

               ELINOR is torn between discomfiture and compassion.

                                     ELINOR
                         Colonel, though neither one has 
                         informed me of their under standing, 
                         I have no doubt of their mutual 
                         affection.

               BRANDON stands very still.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Thank you, Miss Dashwood. To your 
                         sister I wish all imaginable 
                         happiness. To Mr Willoughby, that 
                         he... may endeavour to deserve her.

               His tone is heavy with some bitter meaning.

                                     ELINOR
                         What do you mean?

               But he recollects himself.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Forgive me, I--forgive me.

               He bows and leaves abruptly. ELINOR is deeply troubled.

               EXT. GREENWICH ARCADE - LONDON - DAY

               The PALMERS, MRS JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and 
               MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth 
               has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts 
               as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding 
               ELINOR's arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS JENNINGS is gossiping 
               with CHARLOTTE.

               MARIANNE's good looks are heightened by her feverish 
               expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many 
               young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Where is dear Edward, John? We expect 
                         to see him daily.

               FANNY stiffens. LUCY's sharp eyes dart hither and thither. 
               MRS JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         And who is 'dear Edward'?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Who indeed?

               FANNY smiles glacially.

                                     FANNY
                         My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward 
                         Ferrars.

               MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F?

               She and CHARLOTTE chuckle to each other. LUCY looks at ELINOR.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - EVE

               MRS JENNINGS, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE return from their 
               outing. MARIANNE immediately assails PIGEON.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Are there any messages, Pigeon?

                                     PIGEON
                         No, ma'am.

                                     MARIANNE
                         No message at all? No cards?

                                     PIGEON
                              (affronted)
                         None, ma am.

               MARIANNE sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs. 
               MRS JENNINGS looks archly at ELINOR.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I note you do not inquire for your 
                         messages, Miss Dashwood!

                                     ELINOR
                         No, for I do not expect any, Mrs 
                         Jennings. I have very little 
                         acquaintance in town.

               And she follows MARIANNE firmly upstairs. LUCY watches her 
               go, and MRS JENNINGS chuckles and turns to her.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         She is as sly as you, Lucy!

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ELINOR wakes up. The flickering of a candle has disturbed 
               her. She sits up in bed and sees MARIANNE sitting at the 
               desk in her nightgown, writing another letter.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, is anything wrong?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Nothing at all. Go back to sleep.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - MORNING ROOM - NIGHT

               MARIANNE, in her nightclothes and dressing gown, paces 
               restlessly, her letter in her hands. A slight knock at the 
               door heralds a much-ruffled PIGEON, wig askew. MARIANNE hands 
               him the letter. He bows and goes, highly disgruntled.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - MORNING

               MRS JENNINGS is giving PIGEON his instructions for the day. 
               MARIANNE comes running downstairs. PIGEON regards her drily.

                                     PIGEON
                         No messages, ma am.

               MARIANNE looks so dejected that MRS JENNINGS takes her hand.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Do not fret, my dear. I am told that 
                         this good weather is keeping many 
                         sportsmen in the country at present, 
                         but the frost will drive them back 
                         to town very soon, depend upon it.

               MARIANNE brightens.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Of course! I had not thought of--
                         thank you, Mrs Jennings!

               She runs back upstairs. MRS JENNINGS calls after her.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         And Miss Dashwood may set her heart 
                         at rest, for I overheard your sister-
                         in-law say that she was to bring the 
                         elusive Mr F to the ball tonight!

               EXT. GRAND CRESCENT LEADING TO BALLROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               So many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the 
               GUESTS that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to 
               walk to the entrance. We see MRS JENNINGS, MARIANNE, ELINOR 
               and LUCY alighting from their carriage and picking their way 
               through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles. 
               ELINOR nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto LUCY in order 
               not to slip into the dirt.

               INT. GRAND BALLROOM - EVE

               The great ballroom is crammed with GUESTS all determined to 
               enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences 
               caused by noise, heat and overcrowding. MEN are sweating 
               profusely, WOMEN dab their brows, rack punch is being 
               swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch 
               and all conversation is inordinately loud. Only the DANCERS 
               have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing 
               steps. MRS JENNINGS and her brood bump into the PALMERS.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (screeching)
                         This is very merry!

               MRS JENNINGS then spots FANNY, who is conducting a desultory 
               conversation with an overpowdered ACQUAINTANCE. She drags 
               ELINOR, MARIANNE and LUCY over to her.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         There you are! Goodness, how hot it 
                         is, Mrs Dashwood. You are not alone, 
                         I trust?

                                     FANNY
                         Indeed not. John is just gone to 
                         fetch my brother--he has been eating 
                         ices.

               LUCY clutches at ELINOR's sleeve.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Your brother! I declare, that is 
                         good news indeed. At long last!

               And she beams her approval upon ELINOR.

                                     LUCY
                              (whispering)
                         Miss Dashwood, I declare I shall 
                         faint clean away.

               FANNY has seen JOHN threading his way towards them and waves 
               at him. There is someone behind him. LUCY preens. JOHN bows 
               to them.

                                     JOHN
                         Mrs Jennings, may I present my brother-
                         in-law?

               He turns to reveal a good-looking young MAN with a vacuous 
               smile.

                                     JOHN
                         Mr Robert Ferrars!

                                     ROBERT
                         My dear ladies--we meet at last!

               There is a general bowing and shaking of hands. ELINOR is 
               relieved. LUCY drops a low curtsy.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         So you must be the younger brother? 
                         Is Mr Edward not here? Miss Dashwood 
                         here was counting on him!

               ROBERT looks ELINOR up and down. He exchanges glances with 
               FANNY before he speaks.

                                     ROBERT
                         Oh! He is far too busy for such 
                         gatherings--and has no special 
                         acquaintance here to make his 
                         attendance worthwhile.

               MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in puzzlement.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Well, I declare, I do not know what 
                         the young men are about these days--
                         are they all in hiding?

               ELINOR looks down, agonised with embarrassment.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Come, Mr Robert, in the absence of 
                         your brother, you must dance with 
                         our lovely Miss Dashwood!

                                     ROBERT
                              (not best pleased)
                         It would be my honour.

               He turns to LUCY and bows.

                                     ROBERT
                         And perhaps Miss Steele might consider 
                         reserving the allemande?

               LUCY curtsies again. ROBERT escorts a most unwilling ELINOR 
               onto the dance floor.

                                     ROBERT
                         You reside in Devonshire, I b'lieve, 
                         Miss Dashwood?

                                     ELINOR
                         We do.

                                     ROBERT
                         In a cottage?

                                     ELINOR
                         Yes.

                                     ROBERT
                         I am excessively fond of a cottage. 
                         If I had any money to spare, I should 
                         build one myself.

               Luckily for ELINOR the set changes and she is obliged to 
               turn away from ROBERT. She wheels round to face her new 
               partner. It is WILLOUGHBY! They both stop dancing and stare 
               at each other aghast. A traffic jam starts and they are forced 
               to take hands and resume the steps.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                              (stiff)
                         How do you do, Miss Dashwood?

               ELINOR does not know quite how to respond.

                                     ELINOR
                         I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.

               She looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep 
               her away from WILLOUGHBY.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         How is your--family?

                                     ELINOR
                              (cold)
                         We are all extremely well, Mr 
                         Willoughby--thank you for your kind 
                         inquiry.

               WILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At 
               the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the 
               brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across 
               the room.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Willoughby!

               Everyone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with 
               both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the 
               noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their 
               partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching. 
               MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms 
               frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor 
                         shake hands with me?

               WILLOUGHBY looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards 
               a group of very smart PEOPLE who are watching him closely. 
               Central to this group is a SOPHISTICATED WOMAN who frowns at 
               him proprietorially.

               WILLOUGHBY shakes MARIANNE's hand briefly. Behind her, MRS 
               JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN, 
               while LUCY whispers in ROBERT's ear as they go past to join 
               the set.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                              (strangled)
                         How do you do, Miss Marianne?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Willoughby, what is the matter? Why 
                         have you not come to see me? Were 
                         you not in London? Have you nor 
                         received my letters?

               WILLOUGHBY is sweating with tension.

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving 
                         the information which you were so 
                         good as to send me.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (piteously)
                         For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell 
                         me what is wrong!

                                     WILLOUGHBY
                         Thank you--I am most obliged. If you 
                         will excuse me, I must return to my 
                         party.

               He bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the 
               SOPHISTICATED WOMAN.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Willoughby!

               He is drawn away by his PARTY, some of whom look back at 
               MARIANNE with a mixture of curiosity and condescension. 
               MARIANNE almost sinks to her knees. ELINOR supports her.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne! Come away!

                                     MARIANNE
                         Go to him, Elinor--force him to come 
                         to me.

               MRS JENNINGS has come up, full of concern.

                                     ELINOR
                         Dearest, do not betray what you feel 
                         to everyone present! This is not the 
                         place for explanations--

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Come along, dear.

               They almost have to drag MARIANNE away. MRS JENNINGS turns 
               back to the DASHWOOD party. FANNY and JOHN have practically 
               imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as 
               much as possible from the source. LUCY and ROBERT are dancing 
               nearby.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Will you come, Lucy?

                                     LUCY
                         Oh, are we leaving so soon?

                                     ROBERT
                         If I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings, 
                         it would be our pleasure to escort 
                         your young charge home.

                                     LUCY
                         How very kind!

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         That is very handsome--

               She rushes off to follow MARIANNE and ELINOR. We stay for a 
               moment with LUCY and ROBERT who have left the set.

                                     ROBERT
                         She actually sent him messages during 
                         the night?

               CAM rises to show the DASHWOODS exiting past the whispering, 
               sneering faces of the CROWD.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               MARIANNE sits scribbling a letter at the desk.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, please tell me--

                                     MARIANNE
                         Do not ask me questions!

                                     ELINOR
                         You have no confidence in me.

                                     MARIANNE
                         This reproach from you! You, who 
                         confide in no one.

                                     ELINOR
                         I have nothing to tell.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Nor I. We have neither of us anything 
                         to tell. I because I conceal nothing 
                         and you because you communicate 
                         nothing.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

               A silent breakfast. MARIANNE is red-eyed from crying and 
               limp from lack of sleep. MRS JENNINGS is dressed to go out, 
               pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual. PIGEON enters 
               with a letter on a salver. He offers it to MARIANNE. She 
               seizes it and runs out of the room. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         There now! Lovers' quarrels are swift 
                         to heal! That letter will do the 
                         trick, mark my word.

               She goes to the door.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I must be off. I hope he won't keep 
                         her waiting much longer, Miss 
                         Dashwood. It hurts to see her looking 
                         so forlorn.

               She leaves and ELINOR finds herself alone with LUCY, who 
               loses no time in sharing her new-found happiness.

                                     LUCY
                         What a welcome I had from Edward's 
                         family, Miss Dashwood--I am surprised 
                         you never told me what an agreeable 
                         woman your sister-in-law is! And Mr 
                         Robert--all so affable!

                                     ELINOR
                         It is perhaps fortunate that none of 
                         them knows of your engagement. Excuse 
                         me.

               ELINOR rises and leaves.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

               ELINOR finds MARIANNE sitting on the edge of the bed. She 
               does not acknowledge ELINOR but merely lifts the letter and 
               reads out, with deadly calm:

                                     MARIANNE
                         'My dear Madam--I am quite at a loss 
                         to discover in what point I could be 
                         so unfortunate as to offend you. My 
                         esteem for your family is very sincere 
                         but if I have given rise to a belief 
                         of more than I felt or meant to 
                         express, I shall reproach myself for 
                         not having been more guarded. My 
                         affections have long been engaged 
                         elsewhere and it is with great regret 
                         that I return your letters and the 
                         lock of hair which you so obligingly 
                         bestowed upon me. I am etc. John 
                         Willoughby.'

                                     ELINOR
                         Oh, Marianne.

               MARIANNE gives a great howl of pain and flings herself across 
               the bed as though in physical agony.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, oh, Marianne--it is better 
                         to know at once what his intentions 
                         are. Dearest, think of what you would 
                         have felt if your engagement had 
                         carried on for months and months 
                         before he chose to put an end to it.

                                     MARIANNE
                         We are not engaged.

                                     ELINOR
                         But you wrote to him! I thought then 
                         that he must have left you with some 
                         kind of understanding?

                                     MARIANNE
                         No--he is not so unworthy as you 
                         think him.

                                     ELINOR
                         Not so unworthy! Did he tell you 
                         that he loved you?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Yes. No--never absolutely. It was 
                         every day implied, but never declared. 
                         Sometimes I thought it had been, but 
                         it never was. He has broken no vow.

                                     ELINOR
                         He has broken faith with all of us, 
                         he made us all believe he loved you.

                                     MARIANNE
                         He did! He did--he loved me as I 
                         loved him.

               MRS JENNINGS bursts through the door in her hat and coat, 
               panting.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         I had to come straight up--how are 
                         you, Miss Marianne?

               MARIANNE begins to sob uncontrollably.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Poor thing! She looks very bad. No 
                         wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but 
                         too true. I was told here in the 
                         street by Miss Morton, who is a great 
                         friend: he is to be married at the 
                         end of the month--to a Miss Grey 
                         with fifty thousand pounds. Well, 
                         said I, if 'tis true, then he is a 
                         good-for-nothing who has used my 
                         young friend abominably ill, and I 
                         wish with all my soul that his wife 
                         may plague his heart out!

               She goes round the bed to comfort MARIANNE.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         But he is not the only young man 
                         worth having, my dear, and with your 
                         pretty face you will never want for 
                         admirers.

               MARIANNE sobs even harder.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Ah, me! She had better have her cry 
                         out and have done with it. I will go 
                         and look out something to tempt her--
                         does she care for olives?

                                     ELINOR
                         I cannot tell you.

               MRS JENNINGS leaves. MARIANNE seizes the letter again.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I cannot believe his nature capable 
                         of such cruelty!

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, there is no excuse for him--
                         this is his hand--

                                     MARIANNE
                         But it cannot be his heart! Oh, Mamma! 
                         I want Mamma! Elinor, please take me 
                         home! Cannot we go tomorrow?

                                     ELINOR
                         There is no one to take us.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Cannot we hire a carriage?

                                     ELINOR
                         We have no money--and indeed we owe 
                         Mrs Jennings more courtesy.

                                     MARIANNE
                         All she wants is gossip and she only 
                         likes me because I supply it! Oh, 
                         God! I cannot endure to stay.

                                     ELINOR
                         I will find a way. I promise.

               INT. COFFEE-HOUSE - COVENT GARDEN - DAY

               FANNY, JOHN and ROBERT are drinking chocolate together.

                                     ROBERT
                         Apparently they never were engaged.

                                     FANNY
                         Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds. 
                         Marianne is virtually penniless.

                                     JOHN
                         She cannot have expected him to go 
                         through with it. But I feel for 
                         Marianne--she will lose her bloom 
                         and end a spinster like Elinor. I 
                         think, my dear, we might consider 
                         having them to stay with us for a 
                         few days--we are, after all, family, 
                         and my father.

               He trails off. FANNY exchanges an alarmed glance with ROBERT. 
               She thinks fast.

                                     FANNY
                         My love, I would ask them with all 
                         my heart, but I have already asked 
                         Miss Steele for a visit and we cannot 
                         deprive Mrs Jennings of all her 
                         company at once. We can invite your 
                         sisters some other year, you know, 
                         and Miss Steele will profit far more 
                         from your generosity--poor girl!

                                     JOHN
                         That is very thoughtful, Fanny. We 
                         shall ask Elinor and Marianne next 
                         year, then... Certainly!

               EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON STREET - DAY

               MRS JENNINGS's carriage stands outside. A livened FOOTMAN 
               opens the door and LUCY steps out brandishing a new muff.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

               MARIANNE sits alone on the bed. Around her lie her notes to 
               Willoughby, her lock of hair and the pocket sonnets. In her 
               hands is the creased and tear-stained letter from Willoughby 
               which she is examining over and over.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               ELINOR is seated at a desk writing a letter. There is a sudden 
               rap at the front door. Footsteps are heard and as she turns, 
               the maid enters with COLONEL BRANDON. ELINOR rises to greet 
               him.

                                     ELINOR
                         Thank you for coming, Colonel.

               He bows. ELINOR is on edge. BRANDON looks haggard with 
               concern.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         How does your sister?

                                     ELINOR
                         I must get her home as quickly as 
                         possible. The Palmers can take us as 
                         far as Cleveland, which is but a day 
                         from Barton--

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Then permit me to accompany you and 
                         take you straight on from Cleveland 
                         to Barton myself.

               ELINOR takes his hands gratefully.

                                     ELINOR
                         I confess that is precisely what I 
                         had hoped for. Marianne suffers 
                         cruelly, and what pains me most is 
                         how hard she tries to justify Mr 
                         Willoughby. But you know her 
                         disposition.

               After a moment BRANDON nods. He seems unable to remain still 
               or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Perhaps I--my regard for you all--
                         Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to 
                         prove it by relating some 
                         circumstances which nothing but an 
                         earnest desire of being useful--

                                     ELINOR
                         You have something to tell me of Mr 
                         Willoughby.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                              (nods)
                         When I quitted Barton last--but I 
                         must go further back. A short account 
                         of myself will be necessary. No 
                         doubt... no doubt Mrs Jennings has 
                         apprised you of certain events in my 
                         past--the sad outcome of my connection 
                         with a young woman named Eliza.

               ELINOR nods.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         What is not commonly known is that 
                         twenty years ago, Eliza bore an 
                         illegitimate child. The father, 
                         whoever he was, abandoned them.

               This is strong stuff. ELINOR's concern deepens.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         As she lay dying, she begged me to 
                         look after the child. Eliza died in 
                         my arms, broken, wasted away--ah! 
                         Miss Dashwood, such a subject--
                         untouched for so many years--it is 
                         dangerous...

               He paces about, barely able to conceal his distress.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I had failed Eliza in every other 
                         way--I could not refuse her now. I 
                         took the child--Beth is her name--
                         and placed her with a family where I 
                         could be sure she would be well looked 
                         after. I saw her whenever I could. I 
                         saw that she was headstrong like her 
                         mother--and, God forgive me, I 
                         indulged her, I allowed her too much 
                         freedom. Almost a year ago, she 
                         disappeared.

                                     ELINOR
                         Disappeared!

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I instigated a search but for eight 
                         months I was left to imagine the 
                         worst. At last, on the day of the 
                         Delaford picnic, I received the first 
                         news her. She was with child... and 
                         the blackguard who had--

               BRANDON stops and looks straight at ELINOR.

                                     ELINOR
                         Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby?

               BRANDON nods. ELINOR drops into a chair, utterly shocked.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Before I could return to confront 
                         him, Lady Allen learned of his 
                         behaviour and turned him from the 
                         house. He beat a hasty retreat to 
                         London--

                                     ELINOR
                         Yes! He left us that morning, without 
                         any explanation!

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Lady Allen had annulled his legacy. 
                         He was left with next to nothing, 
                         and in danger of losing all that 
                         remained to his debtors--

                                     ELINOR
                         --and so abandoned Marianne for Miss 
                         Grey and her fifty thousand pounds.

               BRANDON is silent. ELINOR is breathless.

                                     ELINOR
                         Have you seen Mr Willoughby since 
                         you learned...?

                                     BRANDON
                              (nodding)
                         We met by appointment, he to defend, 
                         I to punish his conduct.

               ELINOR stares at him, aghast.

                                     BRANDON
                         We returned unwounded, so the meeting 
                         never got abroad.

               ELINOR nods and is silent for a moment.

                                     ELINOR
                         Is Beth still in town?

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         She has chosen to go into the country 
                         for her confinement. Such has been 
                         the unhappy resemblance between the 
                         fate of mother and daughter, and so 
                         imperfectly have I discharged my 
                         trust.

               A pause.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I would not have burdened you, Miss 
                         Dashwood, had I not from my heart 
                         believed it might, in time, lessen 
                         your sister's regrets.

               BRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her 
               and speaks with effort.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I have described Mr Willoughby as 
                         the worst of libertines--but I have 
                         since learned from Lady Allen that 
                         he did mean to propose that day. 
                         Therefore I cannot deny that his 
                         intentions towards Marianne were 
                         honourable, and I feel certain he 
                         would have married her, had it not 
                         been for--for the money.

               She looks up at BRANDON. Silence.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               MARIANNE is sitting on the bed staring into space. ELINOR is 
               kneeling by her, holding her hands.

                                     ELINOR
                         Dearest, was I right to tell you?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Of course.

                                     ELINOR
                         Whatever his past actions, whatever 
                         his present course, at least you may 
                         be certain that he loved you.

                                     MARIANNE
                         But not enough. Not enough.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

               ELINOR sits alone with her head in her hands. Suddenly MRS 
               JENNINGS hustles in looking pleased.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Here is someone to cheer you up, 
                         Miss Dashwood!

               She is followed in by LUCY. MRS JENNINGS leaves, busy as 
               ever. LUCY plants an expression of ghastly concern on her 
               face.

                                     LUCY
                         How is your dear sister, Miss 
                         Dashwood? Poor thing! I must say, I 
                         do not know what I should do if a 
                         man treated me with so little respect.

                                     ELINOR
                         I hope you are enjoying your stay 
                         with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?

                                     LUCY
                         I was never so happy in my entire 
                         life, Miss Dashwood! I do believe 
                         your sister-in-law has taken quite a 
                         fancy to me. I had to come and tell 
                         you--for you cannot imagine what has 
                         happened!

                                     ELINOR
                         No, I cannot.

                                     LUCY
                         Yesterday I was introduced to Edward's 
                         mother!

                                     ELINOR
                         Indeed?

                                     LUCY
                         And she was a vast deal more than 
                         civil. I have not yet seen Edward 
                         but now I feel sure to very soon--

               The MAID comes back.

                                     MAID
                         There's a Mr Edward Ferrars to see 
                         you, Miss Dashwood.

               There is a tiny frozen silence.

                                     ELINOR
                         Do ask him to come up.

               ELINOR quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again. 
               EDWARD is admitted, looking both anxious and eager. As LUCY 
               is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only ELINOR.

                                     EDWARD
                         Miss Dashwood, how can I--

               But ELINOR cuts him off.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see 
                         you. You... know Miss Steele, of 
                         course.

               EDWARD turns slowly and encounters LUCY's glassy smile. He 
               all but blanches. Then bows, and clears his throat.

                                     EDWARD
                         How do you do, Miss Steele.

                                     LUCY
                         I am well, thank you, Mr Ferrars.

               EDWARD has no notion of what to do or say. He swallows.

                                     ELINOR
                         Do sit down, Mr Ferrars.

               LUCY's eyes are sharp as broken glass. EDWARD remains on his 
               feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.

                                     LUCY
                         You must be surprised to find me 
                         here, Mr Ferrars! I expect you thought 
                         I was at your sister's house.

               This is precisely what EDWARD had thought. He tries to smile 
               but his facial muscles won't work. ELINOR decides to fetch 
               help.

                                     ELINOR
                         Let me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars. 
                         She would be most disappointed to 
                         miss you.

               ELINOR goes to the door, thankful to escape, but MARIANNE 
               prevents her by walking in at that moment. Despite her 
               anguish, she is very pleased to see EDWARD and embraces him 
               warmly.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Edward! I heard your voice! At last 
                         you have found us!

               EDWARD is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets 
               his own confusion.

                                     EDWARD
                         Forgive me, Marianne, my visit is 
                         shamefully overdue. You are pale. I 
                         hope you have not been unwell?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Oh, don't think of me--Elinor is 
                         well, you see, that must be enough 
                         for both of us!

               MARIANNE gestures to ELINOR encouragingly but EDWARD seems 
               unable to look at her.

                                     EDWARD
                         How do you like London, Marianne?

                                     MARIANNE
                         Not at all. The sight of you is all 
                         the pleasure it has afforded, is 
                         that not so, Elinor?

               Again, MARIANNE endeavours to ignite the lovers. ELINOR tries 
               to silence MARIANNE with her eyes but to no avail. MARIANNE 
               puts their coolness down to the presence of LUCY, at whom 
               she glances with a none too friendly air.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Why have you taken so long to come 
                         and see us?

                                     EDWARD
                         I have been much engaged elsewhere.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Engaged elsewhere! But what was that 
                         when there were such friends to be 
                         met?

                                     LUCY
                         Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think 
                         young men never honour their 
                         engagements, little or great.

               ELINOR is appalled by this remark but MARIANNE does not notice 
               it and turns back to LUCY earnestly.

                                     MARIANNE
                         No, indeed--for Edward is the most 
                         fearful of giving pain and the most 
                         incapable of being selfish of anyone 
                         I ever saw.

               EDWARD makes an uncomfortable noise.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Edward, will you not sit? Elinor, 
                         help me to persuade him.

               Now EDWARD can stand it no longer.

                                     EDWARD
                         Forgive me but I must take my leave--

                                     MARIANNE
                         But you are only just arrived!

               ELINOR rises, desperate for them both to go.

                                     EDWARD
                         You must excuse me, I have a 
                         commission to attend to for Fanny--

               LUCY jumps in like a shot.

                                     LUCY
                         In that case perhaps you might escort 
                         me back to your sister's house, Mr 
                         Ferrars?

               There is an extremely awkward pause.

                                     EDWARD
                         I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss 
                         Dashwood, Miss Marianne.

               He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent 
               with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD's arm and looks up at him 
               proprietorially.

               After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they 
               leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Why did you not urge him to stay?

                                     ELINOR
                         He must have had his reasons for 
                         going.

                                     MARIANNE
                         His reason was no doubt your coldness. 
                         If I were Edward I would assume you 
                         did not care for me at all.

               EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY

               A tranquil afternoon...

               INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               LUCY is sitting with FANNY, who is doing some pointless 
               basketwork. LUCY hands FANNY rushes.

                                     LUCY
                         Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly 
                         t'other day. When I think of her, 
                         deserted and abandoned, it frightens 
                         me to think I shall never marry.

                                     FANNY
                         Nonsense. You will marry far better 
                         than either of the Dashwood girls.

                                     LUCY
                         How can that possibly be?

                                     FANNY
                         You have ten times their sense and 
                         looks.

                                     LUCY
                         But I have no dowry.

                                     FANNY
                         There are qualities which will always 
                         make up for that, and you have them 
                         in abundance. It would not surprise 
                         me if you were to marry far and away 
                         beyond your expectations.

                                     LUCY
                         I wish it might be so. There is a 
                         young man--

                                     FANNY
                         Ah ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is 
                         he of good breeding and fortune?

                                     LUCY
                         Oh both--but his family would 
                         certainly oppose the match.

                                     FANNY
                         Tush! They will allow it as soon as 
                         they see you, my dear.

                                     LUCY
                         It is a very great secret. I have 
                         told no one in the world for fear of 
                         discovery.

               FANNY looks up, curious to know more.

                                     FANNY
                         My dear, I am the soul of discretion.

                                     LUCY
                         If I dared tell...

                                     FANNY
                         I can assure you I am as silent as 
                         the grave.

               LUCY leans forward to whisper in FANNY's ear.

               EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DAY

               We hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence. 
               Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek.

                                     FANNY (V.O.)
                         Viper in my bosom!

               EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY

               FANNY is trying to drag LUCY out of the house. ROBERT and 
               JOHN are trying to reason with her. FANNY loses her grip and 
               falls backwards. LUCY flings herself into ROBERT's arms. 
               ROBERT falls over.

               EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

               MRS JENNINGS is running as fast as her fat little legs will 
               carry her.

               EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BERKELEY STREET - DAY

               MRS JENNINGS pants up the front steps.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

               ELINOR and MARIANNE are packing. Their mood is gloomy and 
               uncommunicative. MRS JENNINGS explodes into the room fighting 
               for breath.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Oh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr 
                         Edward Ferrars--the very one I used 
                         to joke you about, Miss Dashwood--
                         has been engaged these five years to 
                         Lucy Steele!

               MARIANNE lets out a gasp. She looks at ELINOR, who nods at 
               her in swift confirmation.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Poor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by 
                         all accounts is very proud, demanded 
                         that he break the engagement on pain 
                         of disinheritance. But he has refused 
                         to break his promise to Lucy. He has 
                         stood by her, good man, and is cut 
                         off without a penny! She has settled 
                         it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert. 
                         But I cannot stop, I must go to Lucy. 
                         Your sister-in-law scolded her like 
                         any fury--drove her to hysterics.

               She leaves the room, still rabbiting on. There is a silence.

                                     MARIANNE
                         How long have you known?

                                     ELINOR
                         Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered 
                         to take us to London.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Why did you not tell me?

                                     ELINOR
                         Lucy told me in the strictest 
                         confidence.

               MARIANNE looks at her in complete incredulity.

                                     ELINOR
                         I could not break my word.

               Clearly, there is no arguing this point.

                                     MARIANNE
                         But Edward loves you.

                                     ELINOR
                         He made me no promises. He tried to 
                         tell me about Lucy.

                                     MARIANNE
                         He cannot marry her.

                                     ELINOR
                         Would you have him treat her even 
                         worse than Willoughby has treated 
                         you?

                                     MARIANNE
                         No--but nor would I have him marry 
                         where he does not love.

               ELINOR tries hard to be controlled.

                                     ELINOR
                         Edward made his promise a long time 
                         ago, long before he met me. Though 
                         he may... harbour some regret, I 
                         believe he will be happy--in the 
                         knowledge that he did his duty and 
                         kept his word. After all--after all 
                         that is bewitching in the idea of 
                         one's happiness depending entirely 
                         on one person, it is not always 
                         possible. We must accept. Edward 
                         will marry Lucy--and you and I will 
                         go home.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Always resignation and acceptance! 
                         Always prudence and honour and duty! 
                         Elinor, where is your heart?

               ELINOR finally explodes. She turns upon MARIANNE almost 
               savagely.

                                     ELINOR
                         What do you know of my heart? What 
                         do you know of anything but your own 
                         suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I 
                         have had this pressing on me without 
                         being at liberty to speak of it to a 
                         single creature. It was forced upon 
                         me by the very person whose prior 
                         claims ruined all my hopes. I have 
                         had to endure her exultation again 
                         and again while knowing myself to be 
                         divided from Edward forever. Believe 
                         me, Marianne, had I not been bound 
                         to silence I could have produced 
                         proof enough of a broken heart even 
                         for you.

               Complete silence. Then MARIANNE speaks in a whisper.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Oh, Elinor!

               MARIANNE bursts into sobs and flings her arms around ELINOR, 
               who, almost impatiently, tries to comfort her.

               EXT. PALMER RESIDENCE - LONDON STREET - DAY

               LUCY and MRS JENNINGS are on the doorstep. LUCY looks rather 
               lost and pathetic, with her little bundles, hastily packed. 
               The door opens and CHARLOTTE precedes the SERVANT, ushering 
               them in with shrill cries of sympathy.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)
                         I have heard that your friend Mr 
                         Ferrars has been entirely cast off 
                         by his family for persevering in his 
                         engagement to Miss Steele.

               EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

               ELINOR and BRANDON walk round the quiet square.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Have I been rightly informed? Is it 
                         so?

               ELINOR is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query.

                                     ELINOR
                         It is indeed so. Are you acquainted 
                         with Mr Ferrars?

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         No, we have never met. But I know 
                         only too well the cruelty--the 
                         impolitic cruelty of dividing two 
                         young people long attached to one 
                         another. Mrs Ferrars does not know 
                         what she may drive her son to--

               He pauses, frowning in remembrance. ELINOR waits in suspense.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I have a proposal to make that should 
                         enable him to marry Miss Steele 
                         immediately. Since the gentleman is 
                         so close a friend to your family, 
                         perhaps you will be good enough to 
                         mention it to him?

               ELINOR is completely taken aback. She takes a moment to reply.

                                     ELINOR
                         Colonel, I am sure he would be only 
                         too delighted to hear it from your 
                         own lips.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         I think not. His behaviour has proved 
                         him proud--in the best sense. I feel 
                         certain this is the right course.

               INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

               ELINOR is waiting. The MAID announces EDWARD and he walks in 
               momentarily. They are alone for the first time in months and 
               for a moment, neither speaks.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mr Ferrars.

                                     EDWARD
                         Miss Dashwood.

               ELINOR indicates a seat for him but neither sits.

                                     ELINOR
                         Thank you for responding so promptly 
                         to my message.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was most grateful to receive it. I--
                         Miss Dashwood, God knows what you 
                         must think of me...

                                     ELINOR
                         Mr Ferrars--

               He interrupts her, desperate to explain.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have no right to speak, I know--

               ELINOR has to stop him.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mr Ferrars, I have good news. I think 
                         you know of our friend Colonel 
                         Brandon?

               EDWARD looks completely bewildered.

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes, I have heard his name.

               ELINOR starts to speak rather faster than usual.

                                     ELINOR
                         Colonel Brandon desires me to say 
                         that, understanding you wish to join 
                         the clergy, he has great pleasure in 
                         offering you the parish on his estate 
                         at Delaford, now just vacant, in the 
                         hope that it may enable you--and 
                         Miss Steele--to marry.

               EDWARD cannot at first take it in. ELINOR sits down.

                                     EDWARD
                         Colonel Brandon?

                                     ELINOR
                         Yes. He means it as testimony of his 
                         concern for--for the cruel situation 
                         in which you find yourselves.

               Now EDWARD sits--in shock.

                                     EDWARD
                         Colonel Brandon give me a parish? 
                         Can it be possible?

                                     ELINOR
                         The unkindness of your family has 
                         made you astonished to find friendship 
                         elsewhere.

               EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of growing 
               comprehension.

                                     EDWARD
                         No. Not to find it in you. I cannot 
                         be ignorant that to you--to your 
                         goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I 
                         would express it if I could, but, as 
                         you know, I am no orator.

                                     ELINOR
                         You are very much mistaken. I assure 
                         you that you owe it almost entirely 
                         to your own merit--I have had no 
                         hand in it.

               But EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental in the 
               offer. He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an 
               effort.

                                     EDWARD
                         Colonel Brandon must be a man of 
                         great worth and respect ability.

               ELINOR finds some relief in saying at least one thing that 
               she truly means.

                                     ELINOR
                         He is the kindest and best of men.

               This makes EDWARD seem even more depressed. He sits silent 
               for a moment but then rouses himself to action.

                                     EDWARD
                         May I enquire why the Colonel did 
                         not tell me himself?

                                     ELINOR
                         I think he felt it would be better 
                         coming from... a friend.

               EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of sadness.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your friendship has been the most 
                         important of my life.

                                     ELINOR
                         You will always have it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Forgive me.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises--
                         that is more important than anything 
                         else. I wish you--both--very happy.

               They rise. She curtsies. He bows.

                                     EDWARD
                         Goodbye, Miss Dashwood.

               EDWARD leaves silently. ELINOR stands stock-still in the 
               middle of the room.

               EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DAY

               The PALMERS' carriage stands outside the house. COLONEL 
               BRANDON helps MARIANNE in beside ELINOR before mounting his 
               horse to ride alongside. MRS JENNINGS waves goodbye from the 
               steps. The carriage moves off. MRS JENNINGS blows her nose, 
               looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes 
               back indoors with a sigh.

               INT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - ON THE ROAD - DAY

               MARIANNE is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed. 
               She does not look well. MR PALMER is behind his newspaper.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What a stroke of luck for Lucy and 
                         Edward to find a parish so close to 
                         Barton! You will all be able to meet 
                         very often. That will cheer you up, 
                         Miss Marianne. I do declare I have 
                         never disliked a person so much as I 
                         do Mr Willoughby, for your sake. 
                         Insufferable man! To think we can 
                         see his insufferable house from the 
                         top of our hill!

               CLOSE on MARIANNE's eyes slowly opening.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I shall ask Jackson to plant some 
                         very tall trees.

                                     MR PALMER
                              (from behind the paper)
                         You will do nothing of the sort.

               EXT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - DAY

               The carriage bowls along, with BRANDON riding next to it.

                                     CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
                         I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was 
                         everything of the finest--made in 
                         Paris, no less. I should have liked 
                         to see it, although I dare say it 
                         was a sorry affair, scalloped with 
                         ruffles--but what do the French know 
                         about fashion?

               EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - AFTERNOON

               The carriage stands outside the PALMER residence, a 
               resplendent affair with a great deal of land. BRANDON is 
               helping MARIANNE and ELINOR out of the carriage.

                                     CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
                         I am resolved never to mention Mr 
                         Willoughby's name again, and 
                         furthermore I shall tell everyone I 
                         meet what a good-for nothing he is.

                                     MR PALMER (V.O.)
                         Be quiet.

               ELINOR and MARIANNE stand on the steps as the PALMERS debauch 
               from the carriage amid a welter of SERVANTS.

                                     ELINOR
                              (sotto voce)
                         I do not think she drew breath from 
                         the moment we left London. It is my 
                         fault--I should have found some other 
                         way of getting home.

                                     MARIANNE
                         There was no other way you said so 
                         yourself.

                                     ELINOR
                         We shall be home soon enough. Mamma 
                         will comfort you, dearest.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I am stiff from sitting so long. 
                         Will you tell Charlotte that I am 
                         going for a stroll? ELINOR glances 
                         at the sky in concern.

                                     ELINOR
                         I think it is going to rain.

                                     MARIANNE
                         No, no, it will not rain.

               ELINOR cannot help but smile at this return of the old 
               MARIANNE.

                                     ELINOR
                         You always say that and then it always 
                         does.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I will keep to the garden, near the 
                         house.

               MARIANNE walks off. ELINOR watches her go anxiously.

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               MRS BUNTING, a rather baleful NANNY, looks on as MR PALMER 
               holds up a screaming BABY in a frilly bonnet for everyone's 
               inspection.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         We are very proud of our little 
                         Thomas, Colonel--and his papa has 
                         such a way with him...

               BRANDON flicks a glance at MR PALMER for whom holding a baby 
               comes as naturally as breathing underwater.

               EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY

               MARIANNE walks purposefully towards the garden wall, beyond 
               which lies a hill.

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               ELINOR enters to find CHARLOTTE alone with the now hysterical 
               BABY THOMAS.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         There you are, Miss Dashwood! Mr 
                         Palmer and the Colonel have locked 
                         themselves up in the billiard room. 
                         Come and meet little Thomas. Where 
                         is Miss Marianne?

                                     ELINOR
                         She is taking a little air in the 
                         garden.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, very good. That is the great 
                         advantage of the countryside--all 
                         the fresh air and... and all the 
                         fresh air...

               CHARLOTTE's conversational difficulties are drowned out by 
               her offspring.

               EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY

               MARIANNE comes to a gate in the wall and turns the handle. 
               It opens. She throws a glance back to the house and passes 
               through. There is a low rumble of thunder.

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               BABY THOMAS is purple in the face but shows no signs of 
               quietening.

               CHARLOTTE joggles him about inefficiently.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (yelling)
                         He is the best child in the world--
                         he never cries unless he wants to 
                         and then, Lord, there is no stopping 
                         him.

               EXT. THE HILL - DAY

               MARIANNE, calm and determined, walks towards the top of the 
               hill. The wind whips and plucks at her hair and skirts.

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               ELINOR, traumatised by her new acquaintance with the shrieking 
               BABY THOMAS, goes to look out of the window. She frowns.

               EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY

               ELINOR's POV. MARIANNE is nowhere in sight. Storm clouds 
               have gathered on the bill.

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               ELINOR turns from the window. BABY THOMAS stops crying for 
               two seconds.

                                     ELINOR
                         I cannot see Marianne.

               There is a crack of thunder. BABY THOMAS starts again.

               EXT. THE HILL - DAY

               Rain has started to pour down. MARIANNE walks on regardless.

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               CHARLOTTE shouts over BABY THOMAS to ELINOR.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         She has probably taken shelter in 
                         one of the greenhouses!

               EXT. THE HILL - DAY

               MARIANNE has reached the top. Soaked to the skin, she stands 
               with the storm raging around her, staring at the spires of 
               Combe Magna, the place that would have been her home. Rain 
               streaks her face and the wind whips her hair about her. 
               Through frozen lips she whispers:

                                     MARIANNE
                         Love is not love Which alters when 
                         it alteration finds Or bends with 
                         the remover to remove: 0, no! it is 
                         an ever-fixed mark That looks on 
                         tempests and is never shaken...

               EXT. CLEVELAND - GREENHOUSES - DAY

               BRANDON is looking for MARIANNE. He enters a greenhouse.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Marianne!

               EXT. THE HILL - DAY

               MARIANNE stares at Combe Magna, a strange smile playing about 
               her lips. Then she calls to WILLOUGHBY as though he were 
               near. The effect is eerie, unworldly.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Willoughby... Willoughby...

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               CHARLOTTE, MR PALMER and ELINOR are waiting anxiously. BABY 
               THOMAS has been removed. ELINOR is staring out of the window.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         One thing is certain--she will be 
                         wet through when she returns.

                                     MR PALMER
                         Thank you for pointing that out, my 
                         dear. Do not worry, Miss Dashwood--
                         Brandon will find her. I think we 
                         can all guess where she went.

               EXT. THE HILL - DAY

               BRANDON runs up the hillside as though the devil were at his 
               heels.

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               CHARLOTTE is handing ELINOR a cup of tea. ELINOR turns back 
               to look out of the window. She freezes.

               EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY

               ELINOR's POV of BRANDON walking up to the house with MARIANNE 
               cradled in his arms. It is like seeing Willoughby's ghost.

               INT. CLEVELAND - HALL - DAY

               Everyone rushes out of the drawing room as the COLONEL enters 
               with MARIANNE. He is exhausted and soaked. MARIANNE is dumb 
               with cold and fatigue.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         She is not hurt--but we must get her 
                         warm!

               ELINOR and MR PALMER take MARIANNE from BRANDON and go 
               upstairs, with CHARLOTTE in pursuit.

               EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT - RAIN

               The great house sits in darkness. A sense of foreboding.

               INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               ELINOR is in her nightgown, knocking at a door. MR PALMER 
               answers in his nightshirt, astonished to have been summoned 
               out of bed.

                                     ELINOR
                         I think Marianne may need a doctor.

               INT. CLEVELAND - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

               MR PALMER and CHARLOTTE are sitting at the breakfast table. 
               BRANDON is pacing. The rain has stopped.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You'll wear yourself out, Colonel! 
                         Do not worry! A day or two in bed 
                         will soon set her to rights!

                                     MR PALMER
                         You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. I 
                         have never found a better physician.

               Enter ELINOR with DR HARRIS.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                              (urgent)
                         What is your diagnosis?

                                     DR HARRIS
                         It is an infectious fever that has 
                         taken far more serious hold than I 
                         would have expected in one so young. 
                         I would recommend the hasty removal 
                         of your child, Mr Palmer--

               CHARLOTTE runs out of the room screaming.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Mrs Bunting! Mrs Bunting!

               EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - DAY

               CHARLOTTE is getting into their carriage with MRS BUNTING 
               and BABY THOMAS. MR PALMER is on the steps with ELINOR. He 
               takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy.

                                     MR PALMER
                         My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more 
                         sorry than I can say. If you would 
                         prefer me to stay I am at your 
                         service.

               ELINOR is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty 
               exterior.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But 
                         Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will 
                         look after us. Thank you for 
                         everything you have done.

               MR PALMER nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps 
               to the carriage.

               INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

               BRANDON sits head in hands. His ghosts have come to haunt 
               him.

               INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               MARIANNE is tossing and turning in the bed. DR HARRIS is 
               trying to take her pulse. He looks up at ELINOR, who is 
               watching anxiously.

                                     DR HARRIS
                         She is not doing as well as I would 
                         like.

               INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

               ELINOR exits the bedroom to find BRANDON outside. She jumps.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         What can I do?

                                     ELINOR
                         Colonel, you have done so much 
                         already.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood, 
                         or I shall run mad. He is dangerously 
                         quiet.

                                     ELINOR
                         She would be easier if her mother 
                         were here.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Of course. Barton is but eight hours 
                         away. If I make no stop, you may see 
                         us early tomorrow morning.

               He takes ELINOR's hand and kisses it.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         In your hands I know she will be 
                         safe.

               EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - EVE

               BRANDON mounts his horse, turns to look at the house for a 
               moment, and then spurs it violently forward.

               INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - EVE

               ELINOR is by the window, having watched BRANDON's departure. 
               DR HARRIS is by MARIANNE's side. He turns to ELINOR.

                                     DR HARRIS
                         Double the number of drops and I 
                         will return as soon as I can.

               EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT

               The house stands in virtual darkness with only a dim light 
               issuing from one of the upper rooms.

               EXT. OPEN ROAD - NIGHT

               BRANDON riding fast, his cape billowing out behind him.

               INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               MARIANNE's eyes glitter with the fever. ELINOR wipes her 
               brow. Suddenly she speaks.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Who is that?

               She is looking at the end of the bed.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Look, look, Elinor.

                                     ELINOR
                         There is no one there, dearest.

                                     MARIANNE
                         It is Papa. Papa has come.

               ELINOR looks fearfully towards the end of the bed. MARIANNE 
               tries to smile with her cracked lips.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Dearest Papa!

               The dead are coming for the dying.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER

               ELINOR, her eyes red from watching, wipes MARIANNE's temples. 
               DR HARRIS takes her pulse and looks at ELINOR anxiously. His 
               silence is worse than any utterance.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER

               The room is very still. MARIANNE is pale as wax. DR HARRIS 
               puts on his coat. ELINOR looks at him fearfully.

                                     DR HARRIS
                         I must fetch more laudanum. I cannot 
                         pretend, Miss Dashwood, that your 
                         sister's condition is not very 
                         serious. You must prepare yourself. 
                         I will return very shortly.

               He leaves the room.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - LATER

               MARIANNE lies in the grip of her fever. ELINOR sits watching 
               her. Slowly she rises and walks to the bed. When she speaks, 
               her tone is very practical.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, Marianne, please try--

               Suddenly, almost unconsciously, she starts to heave with dry 
               sobs, wrenched out of her, full of anguish and heartbreak 
               and all the more painful for being tearless.

                                     ELINOR
                         Marianne, please try--I cannot--I 
                         cannot do without you. Oh, please, I 
                         have tried to bear everything else--
                         I will try--but please, dearest, 
                         beloved Marianne, do not leave me 
                         alone.

               She falls to her knees by the bed, gulping for breath, taking 
               MARIANNE's hand and kissing it again and again.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDENS - DAWN

               A shimmer of light appears on the rim of the horizon. 
               Somewhere a lark breaks into clear untroubled song.

               INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               DR HARRIS sits slumped in a chair. MARIANNE lies motionless. 
               ELINOR rises with difficulty from the bedside and goes to 
               the window. She is white as paper. The lark sings. Then, 
               from behind, comes the faintest of whispers.

                                     MARIANNE (V.O.)
                         Elinor?

               ELINOR turns with a cry. DR HARRIS springs from his seat and 
               examines MARIANNE. He then turns to ELINOR with a smile of 
               relief and nods. At that moment the sound of carriage wheels 
               is heard on the gravel.

                                     ELINOR
                         My mother!

               EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - MORNING

               BRANDON helps MRS DASHWOOD, who is weak with exhaustion and 
               distress, out of the carriage.

               INT. CLEVELAND - STAIRCASE - MORNING

               ELINOR hurls herself down the stairs. She reaches the door 
               just as BRANDON and MRS DASHWOOD enter and practically swoons 
               into her mother's arms.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mamma! She is out of danger!

               INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               CLOSE on MARIANNE's face as MRS DASHWOOD kisses her.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         There, there, my love, my Marianne.

               MARIANNE opens her eyes and smiles at her mother. MRS DASHWOOD 
               takes her gently into her arms. MARIANNE suddenly looks 
               anxious. She is too weak to move her head. She whispers with 
               urgent effort.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Where is Elinor?

                                     ELINOR
                         I am here, dearest, I am here.

               MARIANNE looks at her with deep relief. Behind the DASHWOODS, 
               BRANDON stands at the door, unwilling to intrude on this 
               intimacy. He wipes his eyes and turns away. MARIANNE sees 
               and whispers to him.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Colonel Brandon.

               BRANDON turns back, his eyes full of tears. MARIANNE looks 
               at him for a moment. Then, very quietly:

                                     MARIANNE
                         Thank you.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN AND SURROUNDINGS - DAY

               The cottage nestles in the first buds of spring. A piece of 
               rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden. 
               It starts to wave about wildly and we see MARGARET emerging 
               and climbing down. She has built herself a new tree-house.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)
                         What though the sea with waves 
                         continuall Doe eate the earth, it is 
                         no more at all.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               MARIANNE is on the sofa by the window. She is pale, 
               convalescent and calm. Different somehow. She listens intently 
               as BRANDON reads her the poem.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         Nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth 
                         aught. For whatsoever from one place 
                         doth fall, Is with the tide unto 
                         another brought...

               We move back to find MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR at the other 
               end of the room, sewing peacefully.

                                     MRS. DASHWOOD
                         He certainly is nor so dashing as 
                         Willoughby but he has a far more 
                         pleasing countenance. There was always 
                         a something, if you remember, in 
                         Willoughby's eyes at times which I 
                         did not like.

               ELINOR listens patiently as her mother rewrites history. We 
               cut back to BRANDON as he finishes reading.

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         'For there is nothing lost, but may 
                         be found, if sought...

               He looks up at MARIANNE. A soul-breathing glance. She smiles 
               as he closes the book.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Shall we continue tomorrow?

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                         No--for I must away.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Away? Where?

                                     COLONEL BRANDON
                              (teasing)
                         That I cannot tell you. It is a 
                         secret.

               He rises to leave.

                                     MARIANNE
                              (impulsive)
                         But you will not stay away long?

               CLOSE on BRANDON's reaction.

               EXT. FIELDS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

               ELINOR and MARIANNE are out on a walk. They go very slowly, 
               MARIANNE leaning on ELINOR's arm. Their mood is loving, 
               companion able.

               EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

               ELINOR and MARIANNE walk on. Suddenly, MARIANNE stops.

                                     MARIANNE
                         There.

               She indicates a spot on the ground but ELINOR can see nothing 
               and is momentarily alarmed. MARIANNE gazes at the ground and 
               breathes in deeply.

                                     MARIANNE
                         There I fell, and there I first saw 
                         Willoughby.

                                     ELINOR
                         Poor Willoughby. He will always regret 
                         you.

                                     MARIANNE
                         But does it follow that, had he chosen 
                         me, he would have been content?

               ELINOR looks at MARIANNE, surprised.

                                     MARIANNE
                         He would have had a wife he loved 
                         but no money--and might soon have 
                         learned to rank the demands of his 
                         pocket-book far above the demands of 
                         his heart.

               ELINOR regards MARIANNE admiringly. MARIANNE smiles sadly.

                                     MARIANNE
                         If his present regrets are half as 
                         painful as mine, he will suffer 
                         enough.

                                     ELINOR
                         Do you compare your conduct with 
                         his?

                                     MARIANNE
                         No. I compare it with what it ought 
                         to have been. I compare it with yours.

                                     ELINOR
                         Our situations were very different.

                                     MARIANNE
                         My illness has made me consider the 
                         past. I saw in my own behaviour 
                         nothing but imprudence--and worse. I 
                         was insolent and unjust to everyone--

               ELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues.

                                     MARIANNE
                         --but you--you I wronged above all. 
                         Only I knew your heart and its sorrows 
                         but even then I was never a grain 
                         more compassionate. I brought my 
                         illness upon myself--I wanted to 
                         destroy myself. And had I succeeded, 
                         what misery should I have caused 
                         you?

               ELINOR embraces her. They stand with their arms round one 
               another in silence for a moment. Then MARIANNE breaks away 
               and speaks with great good humour and energy.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I shall mend my ways! I shall no 
                         longer worry others nor torture 
                         myself. I am determined to enter on 
                         a course of serious study---Colonel 
                         Brandon has promised me the run of 
                         his library and I shall read at least 
                         six hours a day. By the end of the 
                         year I expect to have improved my 
                         learning a very great deal.

               EXT. ROAD NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY

               THOMAS is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a 
               basket of food.

               He jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to 
               the DRIVER.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               CLOSE on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed-out 
               sums. Pull up to reveal MARIANNE labouring over it. Her 
               sickness has left her slightly short-sighted and she uses a 
               pince-nez that makes her look like an owl.

               ELINOR is sewing and MRS DASHWOOD is snoozing. MARGARET goes 
               up and looks over MARIANNE's shoulder. She frowns at the 
               spider's web of ink.

                                     MARGARET
                         You'll go blind if you're not careful.

               BETSY brings in coals for the fire. MRS DASHWOOD rouses 
               herself.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Is Thomas back from Exeter, Betsy?

                                     BETSY
                         Yes, ma'am--he brung back two lovely 
                         fillets for you.

               MRS DASHWOOD looks nervously at ELINOR like a child who has 
               been caught out.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Beef is far less expensive in Exeter, 
                         and anyway they are for Marianne.

               ELINOR laughs and rolls her eyes to heaven. BETSY turns on 
               her way out to remark:

                                     BETSY
                         Sixpence a piece, Miss Dashwood. Oh, 
                         and he says Mr Ferrars is married, 
                         but I suppose you know that, ma'am.

               There is a stunned silence. Everyone looks at ELINOR.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Fetch Thomas to us, Betsy.

               BETSY leaves. They all sit very still. MARGARET is about to 
               talk to ELINOR about it but MARIANNE stops her. THOMAS enters.

                                     THOMAS
                         Beg pardon, Miss Dashwood, but they 
                         was the cheapest in the market--

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         It was a very good price, Thomas, 
                         well done. Would you be so kind as 
                         to build up the fire a little?

                                     THOMAS
                              (relieved)
                         Yes, ma'am.

               There is a pause.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Who told you that Mr Ferrars was 
                         married, Thomas?

               THOMAS builds up the fire as he answers. He tells the story 
               with pleasure.

                                     THOMAS
                         I seen him myself, ma'am, and his 
                         lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was--
                         they were stopping in a chaise at 
                         the New London Inn. I happened to 
                         look up as I passed the chaise and I 
                         see it was Miss Steele. So I took 
                         off my hat and she inquired after 
                         you, ma'am, and all the young ladies, 
                         especially Miss Dashwood, and bid me 
                         I should give you her and Mr Ferrars's 
                         best compliments and service and how 
                         they'd be sure to send you a piece 
                         of the cake.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Was Mr Ferrars in the carriage with 
                         her?

                                     THOMAS
                         Yes, ma'am--I just seen him leaning 
                         back in it, but he did not look up.

               ELINOR screws up her courage.

                                     ELINOR
                         Did--

               But she cannot continue. MARIANNE glances at her 
               compassionately and takes over.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Did Mrs Ferrars seem well?

                                     THOMAS
                         Yes, Miss Marianne--she said how she 
                         was vastly contented and, since she 
                         was always a very affable young lady, 
                         I made free to wish her joy.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Thank you, Thomas.

               He nods and leaves, confused by the silent atmosphere. ELINOR 
               sits for a moment, then gets up and walks out.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - EVE

               ELINOR is standing by the gate, looking out. MRS DASHWOOD 
               comes down the path to join her. She links arms with ELINOR 
               and they stand in silence for a beat.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Your father once told me not to allow 
                         you to neglect yourself. Now I find 
                         that it is I who have neglected you 
                         most.

                                     ELINOR
                         No, Mamma.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Yes, I have. We all have. Marianne 
                         is right.

                                     ELINOR
                         I am very good at hiding.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Then we must observe you more closely.

               A pause.

                                     ELINOR
                         Mamma?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Yes, my darling?

                                     ELINOR
                         There is a painful difference between 
                         the expectation of an unpleasant 
                         event and its final certainty.

               MRS DASHWOOD squeezes ELINOR's arm tightly.

               EXT. OPEN ROAD NEAR BARTON - DAY

               A horse and cart are jogging along. The cart contains a large 
               object tied down and covered with canvas. The DRIVER whistles 
               tunelessly.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - KITCHEN - DAY

               MARGARET is standing on the kitchen table while ELINOR and 
               MARIANNE pin a piece of material around the bottom of her 
               skirt to lengthen it.

               Suddenly there is a commotion upstairs.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)
                         Marianne! Marianne! Come and see 
                         what is coming!

               Everyone runs out of the kitchen.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

               THOMAS and the CARTER are carrying a small piano up the path.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               They carry the piano into the parlour and to the DASHWOODS' 
               joyful astonishment it fits perfectly. MRS DASHWOOD reads 
               out the letter that has accompanied it.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         'At last I have found a small enough 
                         instrument to fir the parlour. I 
                         expect to follow it in a day or two, 
                         by which time I expect you to have 
                         learned the enclosed. Your devoted 
                         friend, Christopher Brandon.'

               MRS DASHWOOD hands MARIANNE the letter and a broadsheet song.

                                     MARGARET
                         He must like you very much, Marianne.

                                     MARIANNE
                         It is not just for me! It is for all 
                         of us.

               All the same, she looks conscious of the truth.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

               MARGARET is up her tree. ELINOR is pulling weeds. MRS DASHWOOD 
               is sitting on a stool working on MARGARET's dress and 
               listening to the strains of the new song which MARIANNE is 
               singing in the cottage. All of a sudden, MRS DASHWOOD rises, 
               shielding her eyes with her hand. She walks down to the gate, 
               looking out.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne!

               The piano stops. MARIANNE comes out and they all gather at 
               the gate to watch for the rider.

               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

               Their POV of a HORSEMAN in the distance.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY

                                     ELINOR
                         I do not think it is the Colonel.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         It must be. He said he would arrive 
                         today. You must play him the new 
                         song, Marianne.

               Suddenly there is a yell from MARGARET's tree.

                                     MARGARET
                         Edward!

               MARGARET practically throws herself out of the tree onto the 
               grass.

                                     MARGARET
                         It is Edward!

               The women look at each other in complete consternation.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Calm. We must be calm.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               Tense silence reigns. Everyone tries to busy themselves. 
               BETSY enters.

                                     BETSY
                         Mr Ferrars for you, ma'am.

               EDWARD follows her in, looking white and agitated.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                              (rising)
                         Edward! What a pleasure to see you.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret. 
                         Miss Dashwood. I hope I find you all 
                         well.

               He bows formally to each of them, lingering on ELINOR, who 
               is looking firmly at her lap. He looks anxious.

                                     MARIANNE
                         Thank you, Edward, we are all very 
                         well.

               There is a pause while they all search for an appropriate 
               remark. Finally MARGARET decides to have a go at polite 
               conversation.

                                     MARGARET
                         We have been enjoying very fine 
                         weather.

               MARIANNE looks at her incredulously.

                                     MARGARET
                         Well, we have.

                                     EDWARD
                         I am glad of it. The... the roads 
                         were very dry.

               MRS DASHWOOD decides to bite the bullet.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                              (giving him her hand)
                         May I wish you great joy, Edward.

               He takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer 
               of a seat. There is an awful silence. MARIANNE tries to help.

                                     MARIANNE
                         I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars 
                         well?

                                     EDWARD
                         Tolerably, thank you.

               There is another bone-crunching pause.

                                     EDWARD
                         I--But EDWARD cannot seem to find 
                         any words.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish?

               EDWARD looks extremely confused.

                                     EDWARD
                         No--my mother is in town.

               He plucks up the courage to look at ELINOR again and is 
               evidently not much comforted by what he sees.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward 
                         Ferrars.

               EDWARD colours. He hesitates.

                                     EDWARD
                         Then you have not heard--the news--I 
                         think you mean my brother--you mean 
                         Mrs Robert Ferrars.

               They all stare at him in shock.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Mrs Robert Ferrars?

               ELINOR has frozen. EDWARD rises and goes to the window.

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes. I received a letter from Miss 
                         Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say--
                         communicating the... the transfer of 
                         her affections to my brother Robert. 
                         They were much thrown together in 
                         London, I believe, and... and in 
                         view of the change in my 
                         circumstances, I felt it only fair 
                         that Miss Steele be released from 
                         our engagement. At any rate, they 
                         were married last week and are now 
                         in Plymouth.

               ELINOR rises suddenly, EDWARD turns and they stand looking 
               at one another.

                                     ELINOR
                         Then you--are not married.

                                     EDWARD
                         No.

               ELINOR bursts into tears. The shock of this emotional 
               explosion stuns everyone for a second and then MARIANNE makes 
               an executive decision. Wordlessly, she takes MARGARET's hand 
               and leads her and MRS DASHWOOD out of the room.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

               The three DASHWOODS come into the garden, still holding hands.

               INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY

               ELINOR cannot stop crying. EDWARD comes forward, very slowly.

                                     EDWARD
                         Elinor! I met Lucy when I was very 
                         young. Had I had an active profession, 
                         I should never have felt such an 
                         idle, foolish inclination. At Norland 
                         my behaviour was very wrong. But I 
                         convinced myself you felt only 
                         friendship for me and it was my heart 
                         alone that I was risking. I have 
                         come with no expectations. Only to 
                         profess, now that I am at liberty to 
                         do so, that my heart is and always 
                         will be yours.

               ELINOR looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released 
               emotion, of pain and of happiness.

               EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN

               MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are stamping about in the garden 
               trying to keep warm. MARGARET has climbed into her tree-house. 
               The branches rustle.

                                     MARGARET
                         He's sitting next to her!

                                     MRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNE
                         Margaret, come down!/Is he?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                              (scolding)
                         Margaret! Will you stop--

                                     MARIANNE
                         What's happening now?

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Marianne!

                                     MARGARET (V.O.)
                         He's kneeling down!

               MRS DASHWOOD can't help herself.

                                     MRS DASHWOOD
                         Oh! Is he? Oh!

               She and MARIANNE look at each other joyfully.

               EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON - DAY

               The figures of EDWARD and ELINOR can be seen walking, in 
               deep conversation.

               EXT. PATH NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DUSK

               Later. The lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching, 
               their words low and intimate.

                                     ELINOR
                         Your mother, I suppose, will hardly 
                         be less angry with Robert for marrying 
                         Lucy.

                                     EDWARD
                         The more so since she settled the 
                         money upon him so irrevocably--

                                     ELINOR
                         --no doubt because she had run out 
                         of sons to disinherit.

                                     EDWARD
                         Her family fluctuates at an alarming 
                         rate. Then, in London, when you told 
                         me of the Colonel's offer, I became 
                         convinced that you wanted me to marry 
                         Lucy and that--well, that you and 
                         Colonel Brandon...

                                     ELINOR
                         Me and Colonel Brandon!

                                     EDWARD
                         I shall not forget attempting to 
                         thank him for making it possible for 
                         me to marry the woman I did not love 
                         while convinced he had designs upon 
                         the woman I did--do--love.

               EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can 
               stand it no longer.

                                     EDWARD
                         Would you--can you--excuse me--

               He takes her face in his hands and kisses her.

               EXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAY

               A group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards 
               the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best.

               EXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY

               A large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The 
               entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS, 
               SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in 
               a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN, 
               MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed 
               in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in 
               regimental uniform.

               The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and 
               everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start 
               to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and 
               BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.

               The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and 
               COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in 
               his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.

               CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE 
               and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their 
               flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage 
               decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON 
               lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he 
               radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely 
               happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her 
               seem much older.

               According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large 
               handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN 
               jump and dive for them.

               The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One 
               hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards 
               into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession 
               makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into 
               the surrounding countryside.

               Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN 
               sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we 
               draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around 
               and moves off in the opposite direction.

    DISSOLVE TO ACTUAL TV NEWS FOOTAGE FROM 1981

    A busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange,
    self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes
    its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK
    O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up.
    The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the
    gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned
    around his head.

                          NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
               Mark O'Brien has been going to UC
               Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien
               in the motorized gurney heading for
               class last week.

    The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus.
    Passers-by just go about their normal business.

                         NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
               He had polio when he was 6 years
               old. The disease left his body
               crippled but his mind remained
               sharp and alert, and since he
               wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien
               entered Cal to major in English and
               learn his trade.

    We hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark
    in his contraption.

                          MARK (V.O.)
               Graduation
               Today I hear the crowd's applause
               Receive congratulations from my
               friends
               Today I ask if I've found a place
               among the rest
               I hope you see a man upon this
               stage
               Who studied...read..wrote, and
               passed the test
               In cap and gown, diploma on my
               chair

    THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A
    graduation ceremony is in progress.  Suddenly, everyone in
    the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS,
    rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the
    stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles.
                 1A.

          NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from
Cal, one of 250 English majors to
receive degrees today.
                                            2.


     The DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a
     diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the
     rest of the stage to thunderous applause.

     THE SCENE CHANGES BACK to the campus exterior. The news
     reporter talks to camera.

                           NEWS REPORTER
                If this report tells us anything,
                it is that a disability is not
                necessarily a handicap.

     In the background, Mark's family and friends are gathered
     round him in a jubilant mood.

                           NEWS REPORTER (CONT'D)
                Mark O'Brien teaches us that
                courage and perseverance overcome
                obstacles.

     It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking
     alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment.
     It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in
     through a partially-opened window.

     INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT
3                                                                     3
     The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and
     quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has
     been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we
     become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's
     pump, coming from somewhere close-by.

     In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop
     from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one
     end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep
     its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the
     pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest
     to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.
                                   2A.


                     MARK (V.O.)
          Breathing
          Look you
          This most excellent canopy, the
          air,
          Presses down upon me
          At 15 pounds per square inch
          A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean.
          Teasing me with its nearness and
          immensity.
          And all I get is a thin stream of
          it.
          A finger's width of the rope that
          ties me to life.

Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then
wanders over to the iron lung.
                                        3.


    It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head
    and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the
    other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its
    length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of
    Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches.
    He opens his eyes and grimaces.

                           MARK
              Shit!

    His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the
    terrible itching.  He shakes his head violently, then stops
    suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.

                        MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Okay, just focus. Now, scratch
              with your mind, okay, your mind,
              scratch with your mind...

    After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It seems
    to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the
    cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the
    only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints
    of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They
    illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging
    on the wall.   Mark acknowledges it.

                        MARK (CONT'D)
              Good morning.

    Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred.

    JOAN, a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s, walks up to
    Mark's front door, takes a key from her purse and lets
    herself in.

    She comes in.

                        JOAN
              Good morning.

    Mark does not immediately acknowledge her.

                        MARK
              You're late.

    A LITTLE LATER

    The center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has
    been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a
    bed bath. He is frail and helpless.
                                        4.


    There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently
    unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least
    temporarily.

                        MARK (V.O.)
              Joan
              I swear this was one crazy bitch
              Who'd swing me about enough to
              scare me,
              But careful enough so she could
              say:
              "Now what was all the yelling
              about? You polios are screamers.
              Always were."
              I didn't say a word, but typed my
              skinny novel in my head,
              And thought about revenge.

    In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an
    involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He
    feels belittled and humiliated.
    A LITTLE LATER

    Mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning
    up a bright red shirt. It is an awkward business. They do it
    in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.

    Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly
    different from the one in the news clip. There are no mirrors
    and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece
    just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a
    colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version
    of his iron lung.

                        JOAN
              Would you mind if I asked you a
              favor?

                        MARK
              You need help moving furniture?

    She has no apparent sense of humor.

                        JOAN
              I need an advance on my pay, like
              two weeks. That's not a big ask, is
              it?

    Mark looks rightfully shocked.

                        MARK
              What if you don't last another two
              weeks?
                                      4A.

He gives her a look, and means it. We hear his thoughts.

                     MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Joan never failed to put me in a
          crappy mood. It was also a drag
          that I was no longer allowed to use
          my other gurney, the self-propelled
          one. It had caused a couple of
          spectacular accidents.

                           MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Basically, in spite of all the
                mirrors, I couldn't see where I was
                going.

     FATHER BRENDAN is giving a sermon. Mark listens with
     satisfaction. There are not many others there.

                           FATHER BRENDAN
                The Apostle Luke tells us that when
                Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby
                in her womb leapt - "For lo, as
                soon as the voice of thy salutation
                sounded in mine ears, the babe
                leaped in my womb for joy". So
                Mary's fear and apprehension slowly
                gave way to pride and purpose.
                Elizabeth saw the greatness in
                Mary. "Blessed art thou among
                women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself
                with St. John, felt the power of
                this wondrous woman. It was
                Elizabeth, and her absolute faith,
                that gave Mary the courage she was
                lacking, and she gave thanks
                saying: "My soul doth magnify the
                Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced
                in God my Saviour".

                May the spirit of the Lord be
                amongst you and remain with you
                always.


     Mass is over. PEOPLE come up to Mark and place a hand on his
     head or chest and say, "God bless you." In the background we
     can also hear Father Brendan.

                          FATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                May the peace of the Lord be with
                you.

7A   INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY                                     7A

     Mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the
     church. He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of
     his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive
     stained glass windows. The expression on Mark's face is that
     of a true believer.

                         MARK (V.O.)
               I'm definitely a true believer. But
               I believe in a God with a sense of
               humor. A wicked sense of humor. One
               who created me in His own image.

     Father Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment when
     he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake
     hands. For no good reason, he nods instead.

                         FATHER BRENDAN
               Hello. I'm Father Brendan. I don't
               think we've met.
                               6.

                    MARK
          No, we haven't. I'm Mark O'Brien. I
          knew Father Seamus very well. I'm
          sorry that he's not here any more.

                     FATHER BRENDAN
          As are many others. I'm going to do
          my best to fill his shoes. I
          understand you'd like me to hear
          your confession.

                    MARK
          Yes, I would. By the way, I enjoyed
          Mass. I liked your tone.

Father Brendan is not sure how to take this.

                       FATHER BRENDAN
          Thank you.

                     MARK
          You don't believe absolute privacy
          is an essential part of the
          confessional, do you?

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          No, I do not. I believe sincerity
          is the most essential part.

                    MARK
          I told my attendant to come back in
          half an hour. Is that okay?

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Yes, take your time. I'm in no
          rush.

                    MARK
          Did Father Seamus say anything to
          you about me?
                       FATHER BRENDAN
          No one said anything to me about
          you.

                    MARK
          I can be a bit time consuming, but
          I'm worth the trouble.

Father Brendan breaks a smile for the first time.
                       FATHER BRENDAN
          I'm here for you Mark.
                           7.

                     MARK
          Look, this is not exactly a
          confession. I haven't yet done the
          deed. I was hoping to sort of get a
          quote in advance.

Father Brendan sits down.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Tell me what's on your mind.

                    MARK
          The most immediate thing on my mind
          would be my attendant, Joan. I'm
          thinking of getting rid of her.
          It's an evil thought, but I can't
          help it.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Is she dishonest, or incompetent?

                     MARK
          No, neither of those. She looks at
          me the wrong way. It's that you-
          need-me-more-than-I-need-you look.
          I'd like to show her she's wrong,
          just for the evil satisfaction it
          will give me. Is that a sin,
          Father?

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Well, it obviously troubles you.

                    MARK
          Yes, it troubles me a lot. Because
          maybe it's really a power trip. Me
          against her. Me against the world.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          I really wouldn't worry too much
          about that. The question is whether
          you like having her around.

                    MARK
          I can't stand her.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Then get rid of her. If I were in a
          position to choose, I'd get someone
          nice. Even it was a power trip.

                    MARK
          Then I have your blessing to fire
          her?
                                            8.

                            FATHER BRENDAN
                  Unofficially, yes.

                            MARK
                  That's good enough for me.

                            FATHER BRENDAN
                  Please, if ever you feel I can be
                  useful, do let me know. It was a
                  pleasure talking with you.

                               MARK
                  Same here.

     We see a pencil eraser on the end of a stick slowly tapping
     the keys on an electric typewriter. At the other end of the
     stick, which is about a foot long, is Mark, manipulating it
     adeptly with his mouth. There is a white index card in the
     typewriter on which he is typing a job notice. We see the
     first word. "POET"

     A community notice board. A young female hand reaches in and

     We see Amanda's face as she smiles. She is in her early 20s.

                            MARK (V.O.)
                  Amanda would have been a pretty
                  girl to touch, to hold, to kiss, to
                  take to bed.

     Mark is in his iron lung. Amanda sits in a stiff chair a few
     feet away, being interviewed. Rod is working in the kitchen.
     Mark's poem continues.
                                             9.

                           MARK (V.O.)
                 Her perfect, pale skin,
                 Her Tudor court face
                 Her strong, fleshy legs
                 Drove me into ecstasies of despair.

      Mark asks a question.

                           MARK
                 Do you have any experience?

                              AMANDA
                 No, none at all.

                           MARK
                 That sounds perfect.

      Mark stares at her lovingly.

      From Mark's POV, Amanda slides him out of the iron lung. It
      is her first time, and it is an awkward business.

                           AMANDA
                 How long can you stay out?

                           MARK
                 Three or four hours. Depends
                 whether I'm having fun.

      It is some time later. Amanda is giving Mark a massage. With
      enormous satisfaction, he feels her curvy parts moving around
      him and sometimes pressing against him. He also gets a bird's
      eye view of her breasts.

                            MARK (V.O.)
                 She'd count in French before
                 lifting me, un, deux, trois,
                 quatre! I'd scream
                 Tugged by her athletic arms
                 From the everlasting gravity.

      Mark, on a blanket, is on an outing with Amanda, Matt and
      another COUPLE. They are playing Scrabble.
                                   9A.

                    MARK (V.O.)
          She took me on a picnic once,
          With her boyfriend and another
          couple. Lust crackled in the air
          between those twentyish people.

Amanda is clearly paying more attention to Mark than to Matt.

                    MARK (V.O.)
          What did the boyfriend think?
          That I was in his way?
          I'm always in somebody's way, I
          thought, the sun in my eyes.
                                        10.


     We sense Mark's deep satisfaction as he closes his eyes and
     the sun warms his face.

                          MARK (V.O.)
                As she glided through crowds of
                lives She couldn't leave me lying
                there Dried out bubble gum stuck on
                the underneath of existence.

                You don't have to be so defensive.
                I'm not about to get jealous.

                             AMANDA
                Why not? He's a much nicer person
                than you are.

     Amanda is shaving Mark.

                What does your boyfriend think of
                me?

                             AMANDA
                He's an asshole. It doesn't matter
                what he thinks of you.

                          MARK
                I'm interested in the opinion of an
                asshole.

                             AMANDA
                He thinks you're some kind of
                Svengali, and that you're going to
                hypnotise me into your cult.

                          MARK
                He's right.
                                         11.


                           AMANDA
                 He says he can already see changes.

      She finishes shaving him and cleans him up. His eyes feast on
      every detail of her face.

      Cut to somewhere at night, Amanda is giving Mark a pole
      dancing demonstration, complete with disco beat and mirror-
      ball lighting.

                           MARK (V.O.)
                 So with her gentle fearless heart
                 She took me in.
                 I thrived in her garden
                 And wanted more.

      Amanda is wheeling Mark in his gurney around the store,
      stopping from time to time to take something down from the
      shelf. She picks out a shirt.

                           AMANDA
                 This you must have.

      As she leans over to show it to him, Mark doesn't seem to be
      listening. He whispers to her.

                           MARK
                 I love you.

      She says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles, then puts
      the shirt back. They continue round the store in thoughtful
      silence and avoid eye contact with each other. We sense from
      the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end of a
      beautiful friendship.

               Well, in case she didn't get it the
               first time, I told her again that I
               was in love with her, and wanted to
               marry her, thinking it might swing
               things.

                            FATHER BRENDAN
               Did it?

                         MARK
               Yes. She left.

     They sit in silence for a while. Father Brendan seems to be
     at something of a loss.

                          FATHER BRENDAN
               I wish I knew what to say. I mean,
               welcome to the human race. Every
               day someone breaks someone else's
               heart. And as I said, I'm here for
               you. I just wish I had something
               more useful to offer. All I have
               are these vague ideas about life
               and death that priests are equipped
               with. Have you ever thought of
               discussing your feelings with a
               therapist?

                         MARK
               Not as yet. Father, I think I need
               a hug.

     After a moment of surprise, Father Brendan rises to the
     occasion. He seems to know how to move Mark gently and
     efficiently. They hug.

     Vera sits in the same spot where Amanda was interviewed, but
     without the same aura, although she is far from ugly.

                            VERA
               Some.

     She is reserved and unsmiling. Mark seems disinterested in
     the whole process. The phone rings. They both look at it.

                         MARK
               Would you get that, please.

     Vera picks up the phone and answers a little hesitantly.

               Hullo.

     After a few moments, she turns to Mark.

                            VERA
               Thank you.
                                          14.


                           SANDY (V.O.)
                Mark, we've gotten sponsorships to
                do a series on sex and the disabled
                and we'd like you to do some
                interviews in the Berkeley area.
                Could you do that? Say in the next
                week or so?

     Mark is momentarily taken aback.

                           MARK
                Why now?

                          SANDY (V.O.)
                No particular reason. If you're
                working on something else, then we
                can talk about it later.

                          MARK
                No, now is fine.

     Vera wheels Mark towards his first interview. The more we see
     Vera, the more we like her.

                          MARK (V.O.)
                There was no denying it.
                A door had opened which I could not
                close, and in invisible writing it
                said: "Do not enter".

     We see the slowly rotating reels of a portable cassette
     recorder. We hear a female voice.

                          CARMEN (V.O.)
                Some positions, like that one, are
                pretty much impossible.

     Carmen, early 30s, is a paraplegic in a wheelchair. She is
     pretty and animated, and has full use of her hands.

                          CARMEN
                I don't know if you can quite
                visualize it. It's called a
                lateral, or sideways reverse cow-
                girl.

     It is obvious that Mark cannot visualize it. Although she
     doesn't give much away, we sense that Vera can.
             14A.


          CARMEN (CONT'D)
Don't worry about it then. It's
just a question of depth of
penetration.

                                         15.

                             CARMEN (CONT'D)
                To some people it's really
                important, like my partner, for
                example. It's not such a big deal
                for me. I get just as excited when
                he licks my nipples, if and when he
                bothers to do it.

      Mark looks troubled.

                          CARMEN (CONT'D)
                I think the tape's about to run
                out.

      At that very moment, there is a click, and the tape runs out.
      Vera flips the tape over, sets it running in record mode, and
      takes her place again behind Mark's gurney.

                          CARMEN (CONT'D)
                Do you want to keep going?

                          MARK
                Uh, I think I've actually got
                enough to work on. Thanks.

                             CARMEN
                Get back to me if you need anything
                else. Oh, and let me give you
                Greg's phone number. He's full of
                stuff you wouldn't think was
                possible.

      Rod vacuums the floor while Mark taps away on his typewriter.
      Mark looks troubled.

      We hear voices.

                          MARK (V.O.)
                Okay, shall we start?

                             GREG (V.O.)
                Sure.

      We hear the cassette recorder click on.

      Greg is a handsome quadriplegic. Vera is there with Mark.
                                          16.


                          GREG
                Oral sex is a matter of taste.

     Mark doesn't get it. Vera, as usual, is impassive.

                          GREG (CONT'D)
                And one thing that really works in
                my favor is that I smoke so much
                weed that my taste buds are pretty
                jaded. This gives me a great deal
                of stamina in the tongue
                department, and stamina is key in
                cunnilingus.

     The alley cat creeps in through the open window. Mark watches
     it approach from his iron lung.

                          MARK
                Who are these people? I feel like
                an anthropologist interviewing a
                tribe of headhunters.

     The cat seems to understand.

     A lady with a crisp voice answers the phone.

                          LADY (V.O.)
                Good morning. UCSF.

     On the other end of the line, Mark tries to control the
     shakiness of his voice.

                           MARK (V.O.)
                Uh, may I please speak to someone
                in the Center on Sexuality and
                Disability, please.

     A pause.

                           LADY (V.O.)
                I'm sorry sir, the Center on
                Sexuality and Disability has been
                shut down.

     Mark looks immensely relieved. He closes his eyes.
                                          17.

                                 MARK
                  Thank God.

                  Sir?

                            MARK
                  I'm sorry to have bothered you.

                            LADY (V.O.)
                  It's no bother...Sir, before you
                  go, I can give you a phone number
                  for one of the therapists who used
                  to work there. Would you like that?

     Mark hesitates. He winces under the strain of having to make
     a decision.

                            LADY (V.O.)
                  Sir, are you there?

     There is something of a commotion going on at one of the
     elevators.  Vera, and a small, well-meaning CROWD, are trying
     to get Mark and his gurney inside. It will not fit
     horizontally.  As they angle it up, Mark begins to panic.

                            MARK
                  It won't fit. It's not going to
                  fit. Let's go back.

     A muscular LATINO guy reassures him.

                            LATINO
                  Hey, it's fine. We got you. This is
                  going to work just fine.

     Vera guides him.

          I don't feel so good about this.
          Let's forget it.

The Latino guy takes no notice.   Vera is flushed and angry.
                                        18.

                No!

     One more heave and the gurney goes in with a jolt.

                          MARK (CONT'D)
                Aah!

     Laura, a well-dressed, attractive woman in her late 30s, sits
     in a chair a few feet from Mark. His gurney takes up most of
     the available space in the room.

                          LAURA
                Did you ever discuss sex with your
                parents?

                           MARK
                No. That would have been
                unthinkable.

                          LAURA
                Why?

                          MARK
                That's the way they saw the world.
                It wasn't just that polite people
                didn't think about sex. No-one did.
                It was never discussed. As far as
                they were concerned, there was
                nothing down there.

     Laura listens. She is pretty in a dark, angular way. A phone
     on her desk rings.

                          LAURA
                Sorry about that.

     She walks over to it, pushes a button, then comes back. She
     has a noticeable limp.

                          MARK
                What's that from?

                          LAURA
                Cerebral palsy.
                           19.

                    MARK
          You'd hardly notice.

                     LAURA
          People notice. It's not easy, the
          whole thing, attracting a guy,
          dating, sex, all very problematic.

                    MARK
          I find that hard to believe in your
          case.

                     LAURA
          Well, you better believe it.

                    MARK
          So, what sort of chance do you give
          me?

                     LAURA
          Of achieving your romantic fantasy?
          Very small to minute.

                     MARK
          Look, there's no need to pull any
          punches. You can be as direct as
          you like with me.

She smiles.

                     LAURA
          Mark, I'm just a humble sex
          therapist. I try to help people
          with sex problems that can be
          addressed. Your problem, I
          understand, is that you have never
          had sex.

                    MARK
          That's correct.

                     LAURA
          Would I be correct in assuming
          you're unable to masturbate?

                     MARK
          Correct.

                     LAURA
          Has anyone done it for you?

                     MARK
          No.

                     LAURA
          Have you ever asked anyone?
                                 20.

                          MARK
                Not specifically. I asked someone
                to marry me. She declined. Does
                that come close to masturbation?

                          LAURA
                You know, being with the person you
                love is not the only way of
                expressing yourself sexually. There
                are people called sex surrogates.

                          MARK
                Oh?

                          LAURA
                Psychotherapists and psychiatrists
                are not allowed to have sex with
                their clients, even if it seems
                like a good idea. Sex surrogates
                don't have that limitation.

                          MARK
                Would this be covered by my medical
                benefits?

                          LAURA
                Unfortunately, no. You'd have to
                pay the full fee, whatever that
                was.

                          MARK
                So, basically, I would be paying
                for sex.

                          LAURA
                Yes Mark, you would be paying for
                sex. But the person you would be
                paying is not a hooker. She is a
                highly trained and sensitive
                professional, who is not motivated
                by money. Just as I'm not. In fact,
                you can think of a surrogate as an
                extension of me. Do I seem like a
                hooker to you?

      Mark thinks.

                What sort of cost would I be
                looking at?

                          LAURA
                It depends how many sessions you
                need.

                           MARK
                Say, one, just to try it and see if
                I like it.

                          LAURA
                I'm sorry, it doesn't work that
                way. It's a process. You have to be
                patient with yourself. There can be
                quite a lot of talking involved.

                          MARK
                I've set aside $500. Do you think
                that would cover things?

                          LAURA

     Mark waits in the little side chapel. Father Brendan enters.

                         FATHER BRENDAN
               Hi, good to see you. How are
               things?

                         MARK
               Things are sort of confusing at the
               moment. I would appreciate your
               advice, as a friend, if you know
               what I mean.

     Father Brendan sits down on the end of a pew next to Mark.

                         FATHER BRENDAN
               Sure, and I understand what you
               mean.

                         MARK
               Do you remember at one point you
               suggested I might see a therapist?

                           FATHER BRENDAN
               Yes.

                          MARK
               Well, one way or another, it's a
               long story, I ended up seeing a
               therapist, a particular sort of
               therapist, a sex therapist.

                           FATHER BRENDAN
               Uh-huh.

                          MARK
               My penis speaks to me, Father
               Brendan. Sometimes I ejaculate
               during a bed bath in front of my
               attendant.

                    MARK (CONT'D)
          All I feel is shame and
          mortification, while other men,
          apparently, get pleasure. I'm sorry
          if I sound angry.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Don't worry about it. Go on.

Mark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiece,
then goes on.

                     MARK
          This therapist suggested I could
          work with a sexual specialist, have
          sex with someone known as a sex
          surrogate, who would be sensitive
          to my special needs. I've been
          giving it some thought.

Father Brendan interrupts him.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Hold on. What do you mean "have
          sex"?
                    MARK
          Well, I don't really know how to
          describe...

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Sorry, that wasn't what... I mean,
          are we talking about sexual
          intercourse?
                    MARK
          I think so.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Outside marriage?
                    MARK
          I did do my best on the question of
          marriage.

Father Brendan shakes his head with concern.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          What is the difference between this
          sexual specialist and a common
          prostitute?
                    MARK
          I don't know, but I think there's a
          difference.
                 23A.


          FATHER BRENDAN
How do you know she's not some
hooker gussied up as a social
worker, who's just going to rob
you?
          MARK
I trust what my therapist said
about her.
          FATHER BRENDAN
How old are you?

          MARK
Thirty-eight.

          FATHER BRENDAN
Why exactly now?

          MARK
I never had any spare cash before.
That's a major factor, and I'm
probably getting close to my use-by
date.

          FATHER BRENDAN
And this is what you want my advice
about? Fornication?

          MARK
Your advice as a friend.

          FATHER BRENDAN
And do I have the casting vote, so
to speak?

          MARK
Let's say I value your advice just
as much as I do the therapist's.

          FATHER BRENDAN
You're serious, aren't you?

          MARK
I think sex is a serious matter.
It's one of the most persistent
themes in the bible.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
               So, is it possible for me to know a
               woman, in the biblical sense, and
               do I want to find out?

                         FATHER BRENDAN
               And you want my opinion?

                         MARK
               Please.

     Father Brendan contemplates for a few moments. He looks up at
     the statue of Jesus, then makes a decision.

                         FATHER BRENDAN
               I know in my heart that He'll give
               you a free pass on this one. Go for
               it.

                         MARK
               What?
                         FATHER BRENDAN
               I said, go for it.
                         MARK
               Really?

                         FATHER BRENDAN
               If you feel up to it. Do you feel
               up to it?

                         MARK
               To tell the truth, I'm scared.

                         FATHER BRENDAN
               Then we should pray.

     Father Brendan and Mark pray together.

                          FATHER BRENDAN (CONT'D)
               Sweet Jesus, Mark and I sit at your
               feet and pray that You bless this
               little journey, this one small step
               for a man.

                 I really feel proud of myself,
                 imposing on someone I hardly know,
                 to fornicate in their home.

                           ROD
                 Get over it. It's perfectly normal.

      They arrive at CARMEN'S PLACE.

     Carmen, in her electric wheelchair, is the woman Mark had
     earlier interviewed. She pushes a button on a remote control,
     which opens concertina double-doors, which reveal an adjacent
     bedroom.

                          CARMEN
                Tada!

     The bed itself is set at a perfect height for someone in a
     wheelchair or gurney. The room has been decked out with
     flowers, candles and incense.

                          MARK
                Wow!

     Carmen points to the bedside table.

                things in that drawer there, if you
                guys feel like exploring.

     Mark doesn't even begin to get it.

                          MARK
                No, I'll bring my own sheets,
                towels and anything else we need.

                          CARMEN
                No, no. Everything will be
                provided. I'm honored that you

     We hear the sound of sneakers on a wood floor. TONY, an
     adolescent with a pony tail picks up the phone.

                          TONY
                Hey, this is Tony.

     He listens, then looks away from the phone and shouts.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
                Cheryl!

                          CHERYL (V.O.)

                          TONY
                Phone!

     He talks into the mouthpiece.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
                She's coming.

     CHERYL arrives. She is in her mid-30s. She grabs the phone,
     puts her hand over the mouthpiece and glares at Tony.

                          CHERYL
                I'm not your girlfriend. When
                someone calls, particularly someone
                you don't know, you can use the
                word 'Mom'.
                                           28.

     Tony glares back. Cheryl takes off her right earring.

                         CHERYL (CONT'D)
               Hullo, this is Cheryl.

                         LAURA (V.O.)
               Hi, it's Laura.

                         CHERYL
               I haven't heard from you in a
               while. How are you?

                         LAURA (V.O.)
               Pretty well. Look, I called to ask
               how you would feel about working
               with a severely disabled client.

     Suddenly, Cheryl notices that Tony has opened the
     refrigerator and is drinking straight out of the orange juice
     bottle.

                         CHERYL
               Hold on a moment, please.

     She covers the mouthpiece of the phone.

                         CHERYL (CONT'D)
               Hey, cut that out!

     He takes no notice. She puts the phone down and moves towards
     him. He closes the fridge door and runs.

     Mark is having a bed bath. His shoulders and neck are covered
     with soap suds. Rod is washing his back. The phone rings.

                            ROD
               Sure.

     Rod eases Mark back onto the rubber mattress and goes to
     answer the phone.

                         ROD (CONT'D)
               Hullo, Mark O'Brien's phone.

     He switches it to speaker so Mark can hear.

                         CHERYL (V.O.)
               Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen-Greene.
               May I speak to Mark?
                                        29.


     Rod holds the phone toward Mark like a question. Mark's face
     looks drained of blood.

                          ROD
                Just one moment, please.

     Rod switches the phone off speaker.

                What am I doing here? Yes or no?
                Make up your mind.

     Mark hesitates, then nods weakly. Rod puts the phone back on
     speaker.

                          MARK
                Hullo, this is Mark.

                Hi, Mark. I'm Cheryl. Laura called
                to introduce you. I understand
                you'd like to meet. Is that right?

     Mark can hardly speak. He eventually forces the sound from
     his throat.

                           MARK
                Uh, yes.

                          CHERYL (V.O.)
                I could see you on the seventeenth,
                at eleven o'clock. Would that be
                any good for you?

                Uh, yes, I think that would be fine
                for me.

     Mark is lying on his side, shirtless. His face is even more
     grim than when we last saw it.

                          MARK
                Doesn't matter.

                          VERA
                Will you stop acting as if you're
                going to your own execution.

                          MARK
                I'm not acting.

     Vera wheels Mark to his doom.

                          VERA
                Try and think of something else.
                Baseball, for example. That's what
                they usually tell boys to do.

                          MARK
                Who are "they"?

     Vera rings the front doorbell. They wait.

                          MARK (CONT'D)
                She's forgotten.

     Vera says nothing. She rings the bell again.

                          MARK (CONT'D)
                My God, she's forgotten, or she's
                gotten the date wrong. Okay, we
                might as well turn round and go
                back. Come on, let's go.
                                       30A.


                         VERA
               She hasn't forgotten.

     From inside the house, we hear the faint buzz of an electric
     wheelchair approaching. The door opens. Mark closes his eyes
     in despair.

     Vera eases Mark onto the bed, positioning him so that he can
     see the doorway. As a finishing touch, she dabs a little
     cologne behind his ears, then puts the mouthpiece of his
     respirator within easy reach.

     Carmen picks up her bag and wheels herself to the door.

                              CARMEN
                Okay, I'm going. I'll be back some
                time after one. If I'm not here,
                just let yourselves out.

                              VERA
                Bye.

                              MARK
                       (weakly)
                Bye.

                              CARMEN
                Have fun.

     She lets herself out.

                          MARK
                What's the time?

                          VERA
                Twelve after eleven.

                           MARK
                I think there's a strong
                possibility she's had second
                thoughts.

                          VERA
                Mark, please calm down.

                          MARK
                And if she does arrive, she would
                be perfectly within her rights to
                turn around and run.
                                      32.


The doorbell rings. They stare at the door. Vera finally goes
over and opens it. Silhouetted against the light is Cheryl
with a substantial bag. She could be the Avon lady. She has a
light blouse, light skirt and her long hair is loose.

                    CHERYL
          Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late.

                    VERA
          No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera,
          I'm one of Mark's helpers.

Cheryl sees Mark. There is no noticeable reaction in her
face, just a smile.

                    CHERYL
          Hi, Mark O'Brien.

Mark clears his throat with a little difficulty.

                    MARK
          Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene.

Vera is already at the front door.

                    VERA
          I'll be back, say, in two hours?

                    CHERYL
          Yes, two hours, that would be
          perfect.

She closes the door behind her. Mark feels totally abandoned.

                       CHERYL (CONT'D)
          So...

Mark blurts out.

                    MARK
          Your money's on the dresser.

Cheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned,
Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an
envelope.

                       CHERYL
          Thank you.

She puts it in her bag. Mark eyes her carefully.

                    MARK
          That was the wrong way to start
          off.
                                     33.

                    CHERYL
          Yes, it was. Shall we start again?

                    MARK
          Please, you start.

She sits down on the bed and looks at him. It is a very
frank stare. She is trying to take a lot in.

                     CHERYL
          Although the aim is for us to have
          sex, I'm not a prostitute and you
          don't need to pay me up front. I've
          nothing against prostitutes, but
          there's a difference. We can talk
          about that later.

                       MARK
          I'm sorry.

                    CHERYL
          The other thing is, there is a
          limit to the number of sessions we
          can have together. Did Laura
          mention that when you saw her?

                    MARK
          I'm sorry, I don't remember.

                    CHERYL
          The limit is six. But that gives us
          plenty of opportunity to explore.
          Now, I understand you are able to
          have an erection.

                    MARK
          Yes, but not out of choice.

                    CHERYL
          Do you know how many men there are
          on this planet who would give
          anything for a natural erection?

She looks around the room.

                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
          Is this your place?

                    MARK
          No, it's a friend's. The only
          bedroom furniture I have at my
          place is an iron lung. I've
          sometimes thought about buying a
          futon, in case the need arose.

                    CHERYL
          It's worth thinking about.
                           34.

                    MARK
          I've got the space. It can be
          expensive though, a nice futon. I
          mean, how much do you think a good
          one would cost?

                    CHERYL
          Mark, just take a deep breath, then
          let go.


                    MARK
          Do I seem anxious?

                    CHERYL
          You do a little.
Cheryl lies down beside him.

                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
          Laura told me you were a poet.
          What's it like to be a poet?

                    MARK
          It's a way of living inside your
          own head, which is where I spend
          most of my time.

                    CHERYL
          But not today. By the way, I like
          your shirt.

He smiles, genuinely flattered.

                       MARK
          Thank you.

                    CHERYL
          So I need to ask you some basic
          questions. Okay?

                       MARK
          Sure.

                    CHERYL
          What is the iron lung for?

                       MARK
          It keeps me breathing. I can spend
          a few hours outside of it, with my
          portable respirator, depending on
          how I feel. But I work and sleep in
          the iron lung.
             34A.


          CHERYL
How do you feel right now?
                                   35.

                    MARK
          Out of my league.

                    CHERYL
          I meant your breathing.
                    MARK
          Oh...fine. In fact, better than
          usual.

                    CHERYL
          That's great. Do you have any areas
          of unusual sensitivity? Any parts
          of your body you don't want me to
          touch?

                    MARK
          I have normal sensitivity all over.
          It's just that my muscles don't
          work. You can touch me anywhere.

                    CHERYL
          Shall we get undressed then?


Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it. He
hesitates momentarily.

                    MARK
          Sure.

Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. Mark's terror is visible
in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. She
starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shirt-
sleeve. Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream.

                    MARK (CONT'D)
          Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts!

She recoils, shocked.

                    CHERYL
          What's wrong?

                    MARK
          Holy Mother of God!

                    CHERYL
          Tell me what's wrong.

                    MARK
          My fingers! They're caught!

She discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the
fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward.
                                   36.

                    CHERYL
          Okay, okay, I've got it. Don't
          worry.

She carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off.

                    MARK
          Be careful, please.

                     CHERYL
          Mark, I'm going to be really
          careful with you. I don't want to
          hurt or injure you in any way, but
          it's really not sexy when you yell
          at me. Okay?

                    MARK
          I won't yell at you any more.

                    CHERYL
          But you'll tell me calmly the
          moment anything starts to hurt?
                    MARK
          Yes.
                    CHERYL
          Now, let's do the other arm.

Little by little, she extracts the other arm. He grimaces his
way through it, but more in fear than in pain. She finally
sets his shirt down on the end of the bed.

                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
          Nice shirt.

                    MARK
          You already said that.

                    CHERYL
          Did I? I guess I'm a little
          anxious, too.

She undoes the top of his pants.

                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
          Okay, I'm going to slide these
          down. Hold your breath.

She pulls. He screams, in fear more than pain.

                    MARK
          Shit, fuck! No, don't do that!
                                       36A.

     Cheryl sits down on the edge of the tub and takes a couple of
     deep breaths.

     Mark, his body now under the sheets, looks towards the
     bathroom door. He can hear the sound of water running. He
     looks at a wall clock and notes the passing of time.

     Cheryl turns off the tap. She has done a great job of pulling
     herself together, and is wrapped in a kimono, which she has
     brought herself.

     Cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress.

                            CHERYL
                Ready?

                            MARK
                No.

     Cheryl continues undressing, Mark looks away.

                            CHERYL
                Okay, the difference between me and
                a prostitute is that I don't want
                your return business. I'm here to
                help you communicate about your
                sexual feelings, so you can share
                them with a future partner.

     She stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes
     averted. She turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside him
     and he finally looks at her.

                          MARK
                Whenever I'm naked, everyone else
                in the room is usually dressed. Now
                that I'm in bed with another naked
                person, I'm very confused.

     She strokes his hair.

                          CHERYL
                So, why is it confusing?

                          MARK
                I'd always expected that God, or my
                parents, would intervene to keep
                this moment from happening.

     She slides her hand down. She can feel his heart thumping.
                                  37A.

                     CHERYL
          Mark, close your eyes and focus on
          your sense of touch.

He closes his eyes.

                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
          I'd like you to tell me how it
          feels each time I touch a different
          part of your body. If something
          feels good, tell me. If something
          feels ticklish or bothers you, let
          me know. I don't want you to
          tolerate anything. I'm going to
          start with the top of your head...

She strokes his hair.

                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
          You have soft hair. It's nice to
          the touch. So you like it?

                      MARK
          I do.

She moves her fingers round behind his ear, then the front of
his ear.

                      MARK (CONT'D)
          That feels weird.

                      CHERYL
          Weird good? Or weird bad?

                    MARK
          Just weird.

She moves her hand down his neck.

                      MARK (CONT'D)
          Good.

His shoulder.

                      CHERYL
          Still good?

                    MARK
          Everything good so far, except the
          ear.

She moves her fingers along his side, very, very lightly. For
Mark, so far, this is the best.
             37B.


           MARK (CONT'D)
Are these the body awareness
exercises?
                                        38.

                          CHERYL
                You're clever to have worked that
                out.

     Her hands massage their way down his torso. Mark's reactions
     are a little like shock waves.

                          MARK
                People tell me I'm very perceptive.

                          CHERYL
                Would you like to see what I feel
                like?

     She carefully takes his hand and caresses the fingers around
     one of her breasts, then puts his hand back.

                Yes.

                Mmm, my favorite brand. Okay, I'm
                going to move my hand along your
                stomach... and down to your pen...

     The expression on Mark's face changes to one of shock, then
     agony, then ecstasy.

                Oh, oh.

     The clock on the mantelpiece says 12:48. Cheryl is now fully
     dressed. She snaps open her briefcase, takes out a diary with
     a pen attached, then walks over to the bed, sits down beside
     Mark and flips through the pages.

                Next week, Friday the twentieth,
                same time?

                Next time we'll start to work on
                intercourse.

     She gathers her things together and gets up.

                           CHERYL (CONT'D)
                Were you afraid at the thought of
                seeing me?

                          MARK
                I was terrified.

                          CHERYL
                You can be proud of yourself. You
                did great. We've made real

                Can I ask you something?

                          CHERYL
                Of course. What would you like to
                ask?

                          MARK
                Anything, really. Tell me something
                about yourself. Anything.

                          CHERYL
                Sure. I'm a very private person. I
                have a private life, I do need you
                to be aware of that, but that's
                about it. This therapy is about
                you.

     There is a discreet knock at the front door and then a key
     turns in the lock. A few moments later, Carmen and Vera come
     in.

Cleansed and victorious.

Doesn't get any better than that.

          MARK
Tell me about your first sexual
experience.

          VERA
Let me think. It wasn't all that
pleasant. I mean, it was consensual
and everything, and I really was in
love with the guy, but his dick
seemed enormous to me, I didn't
think it would fit. It was scary.
But he was nice. I guess he
couldn't help it.

          MARK
Was he Chinese?

          VERA
Are you kidding? I only hung out
with white guys at high school.

          MARK
Why is that?

          VERA
I don't know. To stick it to my mum
and dad, I suppose.

          MARK
Are they happy now you've got a
Chinese boyfriend?

          VERA
They're happy. I'm happy.

          MARK
What's his dick like?

          VERA
Perfect size.

Why do you call it a dick instead
of a penis?

     They continue in silence for a little while.

     Cheryl is at a tiny desk, dictating into a recorder.

                           CHERYL
                First session. Mark is the oldest
                of four children and raised
                Catholic. He was extremely nervous.
                He yelled a lot when I took off his
                shirt, but I think more out of fear
                than pain. He cannot masturbate.
                Has only had the occasional kissing
                experience. He is capable of
                achieving an erection easily, but
                the unusual curvature of his body
                could be a serious obstacle to
                intercourse.

     She puts the recorder away in a file drawer and locks the
     drawer with a key, which she keeps with her.

     incomprehensible. She nudges him.

     He kisses her.

               had. I thought there would be more
               to it. Not that it was unpleasant.
               After all, I was in bed with a
               naked woman. She complimented me on
               my shirt and my hair. She held my
               penis. I haven't even seen my penis
               for over thirty years. Anyway,
               onward. Am I sharing too much?

     Mark is in his iron lung. With his mouth stick, he turns the
     page of one of those anatomical instruction books on sex.
     There are the typical graphic cross-section diagrams of
     penises entering vaginas. Ravel's "Bolero" plays quietly in
     the background as he reads to himself.

                          MARK
               "Sometimes the head of the penis
               may be too large to penetrate the
               vaginal opening smoothly, in which
               case the application of lubricant

     anxious than the first time, but still noticeably anxious.

                          MARK
                What do you think of it?
                Intercourse.

                          ROD
                Overrated, but necessary. There's
                plenty of other ways of achieving
                the same result, but somehow you
                don't feel you've actually done it
                till you've gone all the way in.

     This does not help Mark's state of mind.

     she takes off is her bra.

                I felt cursed, that the whole
                enterprise was cursed. It seemed
                like a totally just punishment. God
                wasn't actually denying my
                sexuality. He was merely pointing
                out to me how useless it was.

                It's amazing to me how often God is
                brought into the sex act. I
                understand that even amongst non-
                believers, the most common
                expression of sexual ecstasy is

                Okay, I don't want to hear any more
                about God cursing you. I want the
                credit. It was my overpowering
                beauty that did it. It took you by
                surprise. Now, where were we?

                I'm going to touch you... I'm
                touching you... and when we both
                feel you're aroused, then I'm going
                to guide you into my vagina.

                that's all you need to do.

     Mark closes his eyes. In his mind's eye, he sees the saintly
     figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the church
     with the afternoon sun blazing through. An equally saintly,
     but naked Amanda floats towards him, her arms beckoning.

     When he opens his eyes, Cheryl is straddling him, but in a
     Leaning Tower of Pisa sort of way. It is a struggle for her,
     but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable
     position for intercourse. Suddenly, he panics.

                          MARK
                It won't fit. It's not going to
                fit.

                          CHERYL
                No, Mark, it will fit just fine.

                          MARK
                No, it's dangerous. It's too big.

                          CHERYL
                It's not too big. Relax.

                          MARK
                It won't fit. It'll hurt. It's too
                risky.

                Please, stop this. I promise you,
                nothing bad will happen. Now, let's
                try again while you're still hard.

     She attempts to guide him in again. Mark grimaces, makes a
     strange noise. We realize that he has just ejaculated again
     involuntarily.

                you can suck on my nipples, which
                you also seem to like. Or, which
                one would you like to do first?

     Gradually, Mark is reassured.

                Mark seemed to be at his most
                relaxed when I sucked his penis. At
                the moment he is fixated on penis-
                vagina and his anxiety is focused
                around that. The root of his
                anxiety is his parents and his
                religion. He believes he doesn't
                deserve sex. He believes he is
                responsible for his little sister's
                death at the age of seven, because
                his mother was too busy looking
                after him.

     A copy of Cheryl's notes comes through on Laura's fax

                  I'm sorry to lay all this on you,
                  Father. My worry now is that it's
                  never going to happen. I'm never
                  going to have intercourse with
                  Cheryl, or any other woman. Maybe
                  intercourse would prove I was an
                  adult. Maybe I don't want to cross
                  that line. Maybe this was a bad
                  idea.

                  I'd forget the psychobabble. I grew
                  up on a farm. It even takes the
                  animals a few times to get it
                  right. Can I suggest you try and
                  enjoy it more? Don't worry about
                  the technical stuff. You're a poet.

it between his lips. After a few breaths he is relatively
relaxed. She lies down beside him.

She does not fail to notice.

          That was what my father used to

          didn't do much good. I'm really
          sorry that the last time I saw her,
          I fought with her. I made her cry.

Mark's eyes begin to look teary.

          My parents could have left me in

          found out the average life
          expectancy for polios in nursing
          homes was 18 months. So they took
          me home. They gave me a life.

Cheryl props herself up on one elbow.

                But can you really picture him?

                          MARK
                I don't understand what you mean. I
                said I can feel like him. Of course
                I can picture him.

                          CHERYL
                From the outside, I mean, as an
                adult, as you are now, looking at
                him with his crew cut and his
                little face?

                            MARK
                Yes.

                           CHERYL
                And are you mad at him? Do you
                blame him for getting polio? Was it
                his fault?
                                  53A.


Cheryl gets up and goes to the bathroom. Mark is obviously
affected by her question.

     Mark has a faraway look.

                          MARK
                She either forgot to close the
                bathroom door, or didn't bother to
                close it.

     Mark pauses as he hears some distant footsteps. Father
     Brendan looks over his shoulder. They finally pass. Mark
     continues.

                           MARK (CONT'D)
                I found the sound of her peeing
                incredibly erotic, and the sound of
                her tearing off toilet paper
                incredibly intimate. By the time
                she came back I had a terrific
                boner.

     Cheryl gets herself into position on top of Mark.

                           CHERYL
                I'm going to rub the tip of your
                cock around my vulva. When it's
                ready, I'll guide you in. Breathe
                slowly and think of something
                delicious.

     Mark thinks. Through his mind's eye, we see a succession of
     images. Fingertips stroking a cat's fur. In the background,
     the sound of tom-toms. A tribal initiation rite. Drums,
     dancing, trances. Then Ravel's "Bolero". Clint Eastwood
     saying "make my day". Suddenly, and with a big yell, Mark
     comes.

                            MARK
                Aahh!

     Mark and Cheryl are lying together. He has his eyes closed.
     There is something on her mind.

                             CHERYL
                You awake?
                                     56.

                    MARK
          Uh-huh.

                    CHERYL
          To answer your earlier question, I
          grew up in Salem, brought up
          Catholic, like you, but the church
          didn't appreciate my attitude
          towards sex.

                    MARK
          You had an attitude towards sex?

                    CHERYL
          Yes, I liked it. They like to think
          they threw me out, but I threw them
          out. So for years I didn't believe
          in anything, and now I'm converting
          to Judaism.

                    MARK
          I guess it's good to have some kind
          of insurance.

                    CHERYL
          I didn't think of that.
                    MARK
          Then why are you doing it?
                     CHERYL
          My husband asked me to do it before
          his grandmother dies. The idea is,
          if it makes her happy and him
          happy, then it will do the same for
          me. Our son is neutral on the
          subject, but theoretically, if it
          looks like it makes me happy, it'll
          make him happy too. That's the way
          my husband's family talks, and
          thinks. The fact that I'm happy
          already, doesn't seem to be
          relevant.

                    MARK
          What's your son's name?

                    CHERYL
          Tony. He's 14 years-old and very
          smart. You'd like him.

Cheryl and Mark lie together in contented silence for a
while.

                    MARK
          Does he know what you do?
                56A.

          CHERYL
He knows I'm a sex therapist.
There's a certificate on the wall.
But he hasn't had sex yet. So...
How much can he really know? He's
not a boy, he's not a man.

          MARK
How much do you want him to know?

          CHERYL
Well, I want him to have some idea
in his head. I hope it's a nice
one.
                           57.

                    MARK
          What does your husband do?

                    CHERYL
          He's a philosopher.

                    MARK
          Wow! You mean, like, at a
          university?

                    CHERYL
          No, in his own mind. He runs the
          house, plays guitar, thinks a lot.

She notices the time.

                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
          It's kind of late.

She gets up and starts to get dressed.

                     CHERYL (CONT'D)
          Hey, we did really good stuff
          today. You were fantastic. You're a
          fully fledged male homo sapiens
          endowed with a handsome and
          substantial penis which now has a
          proven track record. You should be
          pleased.

                    MARK
          Was I really inside you?

                    CHERYL
          You were really and truly inside
          me.

                    MARK
          For how long?

                    CHERYL
          Five or six seconds.

                    MARK
          Is that all?

                    CHERYL
          That's a long time for some people.
          You were pretty excited. I don't
          know what you were thinking about.

                    MARK
          I'm sorry, I couldn't tell one
          thing from another. It was all a
          jumble of sensations.
                                        58.

                           CHERYL
                Well, you definitely achieved
                penetration. It was penis-vagina
                all the way. And you definitely get
                an A for orgasm.

     She is ready to go. She comes over to Mark and kisses him on
     the cheek.

                          MARK
                Did you come?

                          CHERYL
                No, Mark, I didn't.

                          MARK
                Can we try for that next time?

     She hesitates for a moment.

                          CHERYL
                If that's what you want.

                          MARK
                Yes, that's what I want.

                             CHERYL

                have penetrative sex which results

      A WAITER approaches Cheryl and Mark with two beautifully made
      cups of coffee. One of them has a straw accompanying it. He
      sets them down. Mark looks up at the waiter.

                           MARK
                 Could you put my cup right on the
                 edge of the table there, and stick
                 the straw in my mouth, please?

                            WAITER
                 Sure.

      The waiter does exactly as asked.

                 Is that okay?

                 Perfect.

                           WAITER
                 Sir, I'd wait a couple of minutes.
                 That coffee is pretty hot.

                            MARK
                 Thanks.

                           WAITER
                 You're welcome.

      The waiter leaves. Mark and Cheryl look at each other.

                           CHERYL
                 So, what shall we talk about?

                           MARK
                 We don't have to do much talking.

      Cheryl smiles at him. She is looking gorgeous today.

                           CHERYL
                 Then why are we here?

                           MARK
                 I just want to be seen with you in
                 public. I find that as sexy as
                 anything we've done so far.

      He sips on his coffee and soaks her in with his eyes.
                 62A.

              CHERYL
I'm glad you enjoy looking, after
all.

          MARK
I want people to say "Who's the guy
with the blonde? How did he get so
lucky?"
          CHERYL
Or so rich.

           MARK
Okay, if some old girlfriend from
school you hadn't seen for years
turned up suddenly, like right now,
how would you introduce me? As your
boyfriend?
          CHERYL
No, as my husband. Why not go all
the way.

          MARK
Really?
          CHERYL
Does that shock you?

          MARK
Yes.
          CHERYL
Then I guess it would shock her as
well.

          MARK
Who?
          CHERYL
My old school friend that's going
to come along any moment.

          MARK
You really can picture me as
husband material?
          CHERYL
As long as we're pretending, sure.
          MARK
Would you write down your address
for me, please?

      Josh walks unhurriedly to the letter box at the front gate
      and collects the mail. As he flips through the envelopes, he
      stops at one which is addressed to Cheryl, sniffs it, then
      opens it. It contains a sheet of paper on which is typed what
      seems to be a poem. He reads it with interest, which develops
      into mild shock.

                 You said yourself, it's not
                 supposed to get personal.

                 That's another thing altogether.
                 What I want to know is where do you
                 get off opening my mail?

                           JOSH
                 It was scented. I assumed it was
                 just junk mail.

                           CHERYL
                 Even less reason to open it. Where
                 is it? Give it to me.

                           JOSH
                 You're not getting it.

                           CHERYL
                 This is absolutely none of your
                 fucking business.

                           JOSH
                 You're still not getting it. I
                 threw it out.

                           CHERYL
                 You didn't.

      A LITTLE LATER. The three of them are sitting round the
      dining table eating dinner in total silence. The hostility
      between Cheryl and Josh is palpable. When Josh finally does
      speak, he addresses Tony.

                           JOSH
                 Would you please ask your mother to
                 pass the salt?

                 Mark appears to be indulging in
                 typical transference behaviour.
                 This is not unusual after first
                 successful intercourse, but I think
                 he is especially susceptible. He
                 cannot help seeing me as the multi-
                 functional, all-purpose woman,
                 mother, sister, schoolmistress,
                 whore, lover and best friend. At
                 the same time, his anxiety about
                 sexual performance has diminished.

                 Yes, I promise.

             generally right about these things.

             It was quite a nice poem. I mean,
             nothing astounding, but heartfelt,
             at least.

      Cheryl makes her way to the end of the yard. Holding the
      flashlight between her teeth, she rummages around in the
      outdoor trash bin. Finally, she finds what she is looking
      for. An envelope. She takes the poem out of the envelope and
      reads it.

                           CHERYL
                 Let me touch you with my words.
                 For my hands lie limp as empty
                 gloves.

      She goes over to the back steps, sits down and continues
      reading.

      She puts it back in the envelope and walks back inside the
      house. She is visibly affected.

      from Vera, who trails along, a few feet behind. Mark remains

                 One or two years maybe. But we
                 should keep in touch.

                 only place in the world where humor

      Clerk takes two beers from a mini-bar and hands one to Vera.

                 Thanks.

                           CLERK
                 You want to go out some time?

                           VERA
                 No, I don't think so.

                 What, your boyfriend?

                 wrong with this, anyway? We're
                 having a nice time, aren't we?

                              CLERK
                 It's okay.

                           VERA
                 Or do you have things to do? I can
                 go for a walk if you're busy and
                 come back later.

                           CLERK
                 No, no, stay. Is this going to be a
                 regular thing?

                              VERA

                 I don't know. I'm not the
                 therapist.

                           CLERK
                 What sort of a therapist is she,
                 really?

                           VERA
                 I told you the first time, she's a
                 sex therapist.

      The clerk looks at her closely. She appears to have a
      completely straight face.

                           VERA (CONT'D)
                 Today they're working on

      Mark and Cheryl are in bed, their faces close.

                           MARK
                 Boy, am I glad to see you.

                           CHERYL
                 Don't you say that to all the
                 girls?

                           MARK
                 Yes, but I always mean it.

      They kiss. Then Cheryl's head slides down and disappears from
      view.

                            CHERYL (V.O.)
                 Remember about the breathing.
                 Concentrate on breathing out rather
                 than in. Think of anything neutral.
                 Sky, water, trees, ships, music,
                 nothing too dramatic.

      Mark closes his eyes.

                 never experienced anything like it
                 before. Of course, I ignored
                 Cheryl's advice about having
                 neutral thoughts.

      Mark opens his eyes and looks up at Cheryl. She seems divine.
      His excitement increases. We hear the change in his
      breathing. Also in her breathing.

      The expression of elation on Mark's face morphs dramatically
      into something else.

                           MARK
                 Then afterwards, there was this

                 Mark achieved an erection as soon
                 as I started to suck on him. He did
                 the controlled breathing, as I had
                 suggested, and I was able to get on
                 top and guide him in quite easily.

      Mark is in his iron lung, typing. At the top of the page, we
      can see the title of the piece:

                 I was finally there. Too soon, I
                 came. But she kept holding me
                 inside her. Then a look of pleasure
                 brushed lightly over her face...

      We see Cheryl's face from Mark's POV. It is as beatific as we
      have ever seen it.

                            MARK (V.O.)
                 ... as though an all-day itch were
                 finally being scratched. Letting me
                 go, she put her hands down on the
                 bed by my shoulders and kissed my
                 chest. This act of affection moved
                 me deeply.

      Mark is with Father Brendan.

                           MARK
                 I almost wept. No-one had ever
                 kissed me there before. It was so
                 unexpected and so natural.

      Cheryl's lips move away from Mark's chest. She kisses him on
      the lips, light and lingering. As soon as there is enough
      space between them, he whispers to her.

                           MARK
                 I love you.

      She whispers back.

                 I love you, too.

                 Mark is breathing well and learning
                 to pace himself. There is no real
                 physical impediment to a variety of
                 sexual activities, given the right
                 sort of partner. His deeper
                 emotional needs are outside the
                 scope of my potential involvement.

      Cheryl pauses, then goes on.

                 As anticipated, this was the final

What happens when...

What happens when what?

When people become attached to each
other.

          CHERYL
What people?

          MARK
Just people. What's the chemistry
of it all? When people are
attracted to each other.

          CHERYL
Are you attracted to me?

          MARK
We're just talking hypothetically.

           CHERYL
Hypothetically, they write poems,
they have sex.

          MARK
And what happens next?

           CHERYL
After poetry and sex? Nothing or
everything. The rest is by
negotiation, as it were.

          MARK
What do you mean?

           CHERYL
I mean, you can just leave it at
love and attraction, or you can
make things complicated. As most
people do.

Have you?

      The phone rings, Cheryl picks it up.

      LATER

      Cheryl, already dressed, is getting Mark dressed. She does up
      every button of his shirt lovingly.

                            CHERYL
                  What shall we do next time? Any
                  requests?

      Mark doesn't answer.

                              CHERYL (CONT'D)
                  Mark?

                            MARK
                  I'm thinking.

      She finishes buttoning him up in silence. A strange feeling,
      a kind of chill that Cheryl senses, pervades the atmosphere.

                            MARK (CONT'D)
                  We have two sessions left, is that
                  correct?

                            CHERYL

                              MARK

                            CHERYL
                  Or, we could stop now.

                            MARK
                  You mean, make this the last
                  session?

                              CHERYL
                  Yes.
                           79.

There is a pregnant pause.

                    MARK
          What do you think we should do?

                     CHERYL
          It's not we, it's you, Mark. It's
          up to you.

                    MARK
          I want to know how you feel.

                    CHERYL
          That doesn't come in to it.

                    MARK
          Yes, it does. I don't just write
          poems to anyone.

                     CHERYL
          Mark, what do you want me to say?
          How much I was touched by that? How
          special this has been to me? Is
          that going to help you? No, it's
          going to make things worse.

                    MARK
          You mean to say, come the sixth
          session that will be it?

                    CHERYL
          Yes, that will be it. I explained
          that the first time we met.

Mark has a serious and painful moment.

                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. If it's any consolation,
          it's also hard for me to think
          about it.

                    MARK
          Then maybe we should pull the plug
          now.

                    CHERYL
          I think maybe we should. It's only
          going to get harder. I guess you
          might as well save the money. Maybe
          buy yourself a nice futon.

A LITTLE LATER.
                                            80.


      Cheryl is getting dressed. Mark watches pensively. She pauses
      and looks at him. He keeps a brave face. There is a knock on
      the door.

                           CHERYL (CONT'D)
                 Just a moment.

      She and Mark make eye contact for the last time. They manage
      to smile at each other.

                           MARK (V.O.)
                 I desperately wanted to feel that
                 because of Cheryl, my life had
                 changed. But it hadn't.

      Apart from her usual things, she is also carrying a long
      mirror.

                             CHERYL
                 Bye, Mark

                             MARK (V.O.)
                 Bye.

      As Cheryl goes out, Vera comes in.

                           VERA
                 Everything all right?

                           CHERYL
                 He did great. See you. I'm sorry,
                 I have to run.

                             VERA
                 See you.

      Vera walks in and closes the door behind her.

      Cheryl goes to her car and opens the trunk. As she is putting
      the mirror inside, the Chinese clerk, who is showing a COUPLE
      to their room, gives her an odd look. Cheryl takes no notice,
      gets in her car and starts the engine.

      Just then, Vera runs up and taps on her window. The window
      winds down. Vera hands Cheryl an envelope with money in it.
      At first, Cheryl just looks at it, then realizes what it is.

                           VERA
                 You forgot this.

      Cheryl smiles.

                           CHERYL
                 I knew there was a reason I came
                 here today.

      Vera waves goodbye as she goes and Cheryl sits contemplating
      the envelope in her lap. Then she tosses it onto the dash and
      drives away.

      Father Brendan and Mark are together in the chapel.

                           MARK
                 I felt I'd just been through a
                 ceremony that I didn't know the
                 meaning of. I kept thinking, is
                 that all there is? Just an empty
                 hole at the end of it? A bigger
                 hole than there was before?

                           FATHER BRENDAN
                 I'm sorry Mark, you can't always
                 trust your feelings. You've
                 achieved a great thing. It may take
                 you a while to realize that.

      Time passes.
      INT.   MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT
153                                                            153
      It is a moonlit night. On the opposite wall from the Virgin
      Mary is a picture of Amanda and Mark. Mark lies in his iron
      lung staring at it.

                           MARK (V.O.)
                 I wrote letters to Amanda in
                 Germany.
                 Five, six pages long
                 A year passed,
                 Heard nothing.
                 Was it my fault?
                 Of course it was.
                 But the guilt isn't enough to patch
                 over the rage.
                 I pound the insides of my mind with
                 words, such puny fists,
                 And nobody hears.
                                         82.


      The poem ends and we hear instead a RADIO BROADCAST of a
      Giants' game. Mark is engrossed. Suddenly the broadcast
      stops. The digital read-out on the clock radio, which says
      12:57, disappears. A street light, visible through the
      window, goes out. The electric pump under Mark's iron lung
      whirrs to a halt. We hear the sound of air escaping, then an
      eerie silence. Even the cat is motionless.

      For a few moments, Mark seems hypnotized. Then, he twists his
      head and clamps onto his mouth stick. He manoeuvres it over
      to the speaker button on the phone and manages to press it in
      the semi-darkness. We hear a dial tone.

      INT.   ROD'S BEDROOM.    NIGHT

      There is an answering machine on a bedside table.

                           ROD'S VOICE
                 Hi, this is Rod. Leave a message,
                 or not.

                           MARK (V.O.)
                 Rod, it's Mark. I need help. The
                 power's gone out, including the
                 pump on the iron lung. I'd say I've
                 got about three hours before I
                 start to turn blue. I hope you get
                 this in time.

      Mark winces in frustration.

                           MARK
                 Okay... nine-one-one.

      He swings the mouth stick over to the 9 button. As he presses
      it, he loses his grip and the mouth stick falls to the floor.

                              MARK (CONT'D)
                 Shit!

      At first, he seems panicky, but after a few moments he begins
      to control his breathing and gradually psyches himself into a
      strange calm.

                           MARK (CONT'D)
                 So this is how it ends.

      Time passes. We see Mark from a high angle. More time passes.
      We see Mark's face as he slips into unconsciousness.
                                         83.

      INT.   MIKVAH (JEWISH RITUAL BATH-HOUSE).    DAY
156                                                            156
      Cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white, terry cloth robe.
      The room is dominated by a small, beautifully tiled immersion
      pool with a hand rail and steps. The MIKVAH LADY gets up from
      her chair and approaches her.

                           MIKVAH LADY
                 Is this your first time?

                           CHERYL
                 Yes, it is. I'm converting.

      She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady, who
      does not fail to notice Cheryl's body.

                           MIKVAH LADY
                 So, what do you do?

      Cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment.

                           CHERYL
                 I don't think you'd understand.

                           MIKVAH LADY
                 You can try me.

                           CHERYL
                 Okay. I'm a housewife.

                           MIKVAH LADY
                 Why shouldn't I understand?

                           CHERYL
                 I guess I was mistaken.

      Cheryl steps towards the pool.

                           MIKVAH LADY
                 I see you're very comfortable with
                 being naked.

      She takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water.

                           CHERYL
                 That has never been one of my
                 problems.

                            MIKVAH LADY
                 Sometimes new brides come with
                 their mothers. Do I have to take
                 this off? Can I please leave this
                 on? They've never been naked
                 before. No honey, it all has to
                 come off.
                                         84.

                           CHERYL
                 And it does?

      Cheryl takes another step into the water.

                           MIKVAH LADY
                 And it does. They stand on the edge
                 of that pool without anything to
                 cling to but themselves. Nothing to
                 hide behind. This is your body.
                 This is the body that God crafted
                 for you.

      Cheryl immerses herself up to her chest.

                           MIKVAH LADY (CONT'D)
                 Immerse completely. Go completely
                 under the water, without touching
                 the walls or anything.

      She immerses completely. We see her under the water. She
      hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. At the same
      time, there is a look of elation in her eyes.

                           CHERYL (V.O.)
                 Okay Mark, you can open your eyes
                 now.

      Mark is on the bed alone. He opens his eyes.

                           CHERYL (V.O.)
                 This is your body.

      A few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length
      mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. He
      is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the
      mirror flicker over his face.

                           MARK (V.O.)
                 So this is the body that someone
                 was able to love. Not quite as bad
                 as I thought.

      Overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the
      ceiling from Mark's point of view. We also hear the sound of
      rapidly rolling rubber wheels, and a voice.

                           VOICE
                 Mark, can you hear me? Open your
                 eyes.

      Mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic
      cocoon over him in place of his iron lung. There is a
      volunteer called SUSAN in the room with him.

                           SUSAN
                 They'll be letting you go today.
                 Whoever looks after you will leave
                 the portable respirator switched on
                 at night, fully charged, so you'll
                 have at least one back-up system.

                           MARK
                 How close was I?

                               SUSAN
                 To what?

                           MARK
                 You know, to that tunnel thing and
                 the light, and the voice saying
                 don't go near the light.

                           SUSAN
                 Is that what you remember?

                           MARK
                 No. I assume I passed out. Before
                 that, I remember feeling sorry for
                 myself.

                           SUSAN
                 Do you feel relieved now?

                           MARK
                 No. I mean, I'm relieved that Rod
                 got to me in time, but I still feel
                 sorry for myself.

                           SUSAN
                 I'm sure there's a cure for that.
                 Would you like to talk to someone?

                           MARK
                 I feel comfortable talking to you.

                            SUSAN
                 I'm only a volunteer, not a
                 therapist. I can refer you to
                 someone if you like.

      Mark breaks into a broad smile, then a chuckle.
                                  86.

                           MARK
                 I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude.
                 I'm just smiling at the idea that a
                 therapist could do anything useful
                 for me right now. My priest
                 couldn't.

                           SUSAN
                 Are you religious?

                            MARK
                 Yes. I would find it absolutely
                 intolerable not to be able to blame
                 someone for all this. Are you?

                           SUSAN
                 No, I don't go to any church and I
                 don't think about God very much.
                 But I believe there's a mysterious
                 logic, or poetry to life. I guess
                 that makes me a spiritual type.

                           MARK
                 Yes, that would count.

                           SUSAN
                 Would you like me to visit you?

                           MARK
                 Are you married?

                               SUSAN
                 No.

                           MARK
                 Do you have a steady boyfriend?

                               SUSAN
                 No.

                            MARK
                 Then please visit as often as you
                 can.

      She gets into the ambulance and squats down next to him.

                           MARK (CONT'D)
                 I'm not a virgin.

      She looks genuinely pleased to hear it.

                           SUSAN
                 So, are you in a relationship at
                 the moment?

                           MARK
                 No, it was a passing thing.

      The driver is ready to shut the doors.

                           SUSAN
                 Thanks for sharing that with me.

      She gets out of the ambulance and waves.

      Mark is accompanied by an AMBULANCE OFFICER. We see clear
      blue sky through the back windows. The sun shines in and
      warms Mark's face. He closes his eyes in contentment.

                 The best.

      We see the disappearing figure of Susan from the point of
      view of the departing ambulance.

                           MARK (V.O.)
                 I met Susan five years before I
                 died. She was the love of my life.
                 We had the same priorities,
                 baseball pretty much came first,
                 and we wrote each other mushy
                 poems. I never expected it, nor did
                 she, but that's often the way
                 things turn out.

      Rod shows Father Brendan into Mark's room.
                                      88.

Father Brendan sits in a chair next to Mark's iron lung.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          That was quite something. What do
          you propose to do for an encore?

                     MARK
          Yep, I almost found out the big
          secret. But here I am, back with
          the living. If there is another
          place, then I think they took one
          look at me and decided to throw me
          back.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          And welcome back.

                    MARK
          And thank you for coming to visit.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          I know it's been awhile since we
          talked about this... About Cheryl.
          At the time, you seemed to feel so
          badly about her... or about it?

                    MARK
          I no longer feel like that.

Father Brendan is rather taken by surprise.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Oh? That's good to hear. In the
          end, you're glad that you did it?

                    MARK
          Yes, I am. In fact, at this point
          in time, I feel very blessed.

                     FATHER BRENDAN
          Blessed?

                     MARK
          Yes, blessed. They put me on this
          new anti-depressant and now I can
          really see life from the cup half
          full rather than cup half empty
          point of view.

Father Brendan looks truly amazed.
                          89.

                    MARK (CONT'D)
          It takes about six weeks to kick
          in, but when it does, you can
          really tell the difference.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Hey, that's great.

Mark grins.

                    MARK
          I'm pulling your leg, Father. I'm
          not on drugs. I have a girlfriend.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          You're kidding me. A real
          girlfriend?

                    MARK
          A very real girlfriend. She adores
          me. She'll do anything for me. And
          I can get pretty kinky sometimes,
          believe you me. Her name is Susan.

                    FATHER BRENDAN
          I'm flabbergasted. Is she pretty?

                    MARK
          She sure is.
                    FATHER BRENDAN
          Has she got a sister?

                    MARK
          As a matter of fact...
                    FATHER BRENDAN
          I'm kidding.
                    MARK
          No, you're not. Anyway, we're
          starting a publishing company
          together.

Father Brendan smiles and shakes his head.

                     FATHER BRENDAN
          Here I was, all prepared to offer
          comfort to the forlorn - that's
          supposed to be my specialty - and
          now I can just throw away that
          little speech.

                    MARK
          No, no. Please make the little
          speech. I'd love to hear it.
                89A.

          FATHER BRENDAN
Okay, but I'll try and keep it
short.

          MARK
Don't make it too short.

          FATHER BRENDAN
Okay, fine. Here goes. The meaning
of love. Love is a journey.
                                          90.

                              MARK
                    I already like it.

       There is a pause.

                              FATHER BRENDAN
                    That's it. That's all of I've got.
                    I told you it's short. Love is a
                    journey.

       Mark laughs.

       Mark also has a smile on his face as he lies awake.

                    Actually, I was on drugs, I was
                    taking anti-depressants and they
                    were helping a bit. At least I was
                    able to see the cup-of-life
                    metaphor as a useful tool. Of
                    course, the two halves were never
                    even. Not in my case, that's for
                    sure. Look at all the years of
                    unendurable crap I've had to put up
                    with. That fills most of the cup.
                    But in the little bit that's left,
                    what do I have to show for myself?
                    Journalism? Poetry? At the very
                    least, three beautiful women who
                    all loved me and will all show up
                    at my funeral.

       Josh saunters out to the mail box. He retrieves the mail,

                 O God, it was boring, but I did it
                 got it out of the way

                 The transcendent:
                 We had this agreement --
                 God gave me life for a while
                 I gave Him gratitude for a while
                 and it worked out OK

      Father Brendan delivers a eulogy. We see members of Mark's
      FAMILY, all teary-eyed.

                           FATHER BRENDAN (TO MARK)
                 Mark, I know you're watching. I'm
                 sorry, my friend, but we have to do
                 this. Just bear with me, and I
                 think you might like it.

                             FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)
                             (CONT'D)
                 I've been branching out lately,
                 reading Native American stories
                 about the character of the
                 trickster. Sometimes he shows up
                 as a coyote, sometimes as a raven,
                 but he always does the unexpected.
                 The trickster breaks the rules.
                 Mark O'Brien, whose life we're
                 celebrating today, was very much
                 the trickster -- anyone who knew
                 him knew that.
                           (MORE)
                       90B.

          FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)
Besides his irreverent humor and
alarming honesty, he always did the
unexpected.

In nearly every aspect of his life,
Mark did the unexpected. His was a
dynamic voice in a paralyzed body,
a full life lived long after he
should have been dead. He
graduated from college, wrote and
published articles and poems, and --
against all odds, by his own
admission -- entered into the fully
human experience of physical love.

In this way, Mark lived from day to
day to day, from breath to breath
to breath, for 49 years. He loved,
and he was loved and in his quiet
voice, he spoke loud truths.
                                         91.


      We see Rod, Vera and Laura the therapist in various rows.
      Also Amanda, holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next

                Susan Fernbach will now read one of
                Mark's favorite poems.

                          SUSAN (V.O.)
                This is called Love Poem for No One
                in Particular.

      We see SUSAN at the lectern, reading from a book.

                           SUSAN
                Let me touch you with my words.
                For my hands lie limp as empty
                gloves.
                Let my words stroke your hair,
                Slide down your back and tickle
                your belly.
                For my hands, light and free-flying
                as bricks,
                Ignore my wishes and stubbornly
                refuse to carry out my quietest
                desires.

      We see Cheryl, as deeply touched by the words as she was the
      first time.

                          SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Let my words enter your mind,
                bearing torches.
                Admit them willingly into your
                being
                So they may caress you gently
                within.

A1   EXT. 5TH AVENUE -- NEW YORK CITY -- DAY -- SUMMER           A1

     Glistening city buildings reflect onto the WINDOW of an
     upscale clothing boutique. In the window -- a MANNEQUIN is
     wearing -- the best of everything. A PRETTY TWENTY-SOMETHING
     girl looks in at the display: dreaming of the day.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Year after year, twenty-something
                women come to New York City in
                search of the two "L's": labels and
                love.

     Four TWENTY-SOMETHING WOMEN walk away from us -- arms linked
     LAUGHING -- They make their way down the busy street --
     shopping bags and designer purses swinging.

     The young women reveal:

     CARRIE BRADSHAW (41) and fabulous -- walking towards us. She
     watches them as they pass, a SMILE grows on her face.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Twenty years ago... I was one of
                them.

                Having gotten the knack for labels
                early... I concentrated on my

                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          Turns out, a "knock-off" is not as
          easy to spot when comes to love...

She passes a twenty-something girl and guy huddled very close
together. Suddenly, the girl SLAPS HIM across the face.

          Until it is.

CARRIE reacts, and trots along.

               Year after year, my single

               not.

     She hurries across the street to meet that SOMEONE...


8    INT. MIRANDA'S BROOKLYN HOUSE/BACKYARD -- DAY -- SUMMER          8

     MIRANDA (41) and BRADY (5) are filling an inflatable pool
     with water from a hose. As STEVE approaches with Popsicles,
     they squirt him with the hose. He grabs them; laughing.

                         CARRIE (V.O)
               One of us is married...


9    EXT. CENTRAL PARK CAROUSEL -- DAY -- SUMMER                      9

     Charlotte (40) and HARRY and their beautiful Asian daughter
     LILY (3) go around. Lily giggles, they kvell.

                         CARRIE (V.O)
               One of us... married, divorced and
               re-married...


10   EXT. BEACHOUSE -- DAY -- SUMMER                              10

     The deck of fabulous Malibu beachouse. Samantha (49) sits
     near the pool wearing a white bikini and huge white
     sunglasses making deals on the phone as SMITH lays nearby in
     a bathing suit -- reading a script.

                         CARRIE (V.O)
               One of us... relocated.


11   EXT. UPPER FIFTH AVE -- SAME -- SUMMER                       11

     Carrie walks over and into the arms of that SOMEONE -- it's
     MR. BIG -- waiting for her in front of an apartment building.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               And... one of us stayed exactly
               where she was.

                                                     4.


     They kiss. A good kiss.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               In love.

     A kiss worth waiting four years to see.

     They turn and start into the classic apartment building. The
     doorman tips his hat and opens the door.


12   INT. FIFTH AVENUE BUILDING/LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS               12

     Carrie and Big walk through the beautiful lobby and over to
     the elevator... holding hands.

                         BIG
               I got a good feeling about this
               one, kid.

                         CARRIE
               I've always loved this block.

                         CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Finding the perfect apartment in
               New York City is like finding the
               perfect partner. It can take years.

     They push the elevator button. Doors open. They step on.

                         BIG
               How many does this make?

                         CARRIE
               This is thirty-three.

                         BIG
               Lucky thirty-three!

     They laugh a little as the doors close on the elevator.


13   INT. FIFTH AVE BUILDING - BAD APARTMENT/HALL -- MOMENTS LATER
                                                               13

     A door is opened up by CAROL (55) their real estate agent.

                         CAROL
               The worst. I just left you a
               message.

     Carrie and Big look in. The apartment is dark, claustrophobic
     -- awful. A male BUILDING AGENT (40) stands here. The smiles
     leave Carrie and Big's faces.

                                                      5.


                         CARRIE
                   (to Big)
               Thirty-four. Lucky thirty-four?

     Big looks over at her. She shrugs.


14   INT. FIFTH AVE BUILDING/HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER             14

     The Building Agent holds the elevator doors open for Carrie,
     Big and Carol as they get on.

                         CARRIE
               If anything else opens up let us
               know. We're very interested in
               this building.

                         AGENT
               I do have another apartment that's
               not even on the market yet. Care to
               take a look?

                         CARRIE/BIG
               Sure.

                         AGENT
               It's more than you were looking to
               pay.

                         CAROL
               How much more?

                         AGENT
               More.

     The Agent reaches over and presses the "PH" button on the
     control panel. Carrie and Big react.


15   INT. PENTHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- SUMMER                    15

     A gorgeous pre-war penthouse apartment. Empty except for the
     beautiful light. Old-world New York City style. Elevator
     doors open into the penthouse foyer. Carrie and Big step in.

                         BIG
               Oh, so this is where they keep the
               light.

                                                 6.


                    CARRIE
          Oh my God. I've died and gone to
          real estate heaven. Look at this
          place.

She swirls around to Big -- very grand dame; with accent.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Hellooo, I live here.

Carrie starts giggling. Big looks over to the agents.

                    BIG
          Must be the altitude.

Big smiles. Carrie laughs as the Agent walks on.

                    AGENT
          And across the rooftop terrace ---

                     CARRIE
          What --   Nirvana?

                    AGENT
          Your wife has quite a sense of
          humor.

                    CAROL
              (Cool/quick)
          They're not married.

                    CARRIE
          No, he's my boyfriend.

                      AGENT
          This way.

The agent and Carol start out across the terrace.   Big and
Carrie follow lagging a little behind.

                    BIG
          Aren't I a little old to be
          introduced as your boyfriend?

                    CARRIE
          Point taken. From now on... you'll
          be my man friend.

                    BIG
          Sounds like a dog.

                    CARRIE
          Well, if the shoe fits.

                                                    7.


     She gives him a look. He swats her ass, gently as they go.


16   INT. PENTHOUSE/BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER                      16

     Carrie and Big lead the way into the bedroom. Big windows,
     high ceilings. Beautiful light as well.

                         AGENT
               And this is the master bedroom.

                         CARRIE
               Hideous. Hate it. Hurts my eyes.

     Big laughs, Carrie walks around taking it in.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               How is this place even available?

                         AGENT
               Nasty divorce.

                         CARRIE
               If you live here what is there to
               fight about?

     Carrie opens the closet door. It is very small.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               This is the master closet? No.

                         AGENT
               Yes. Small for a room this size. I
               know.

                         CARRIE
               Hmmm. Hmmm. Now, I understand the
               divorce.

                         BIG
               I can build you a better closet.

     Carrie looks at him; aghast. He smiles.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Welcome home, baby.

                         CARRIE
               Can we afford this?

                           BIG
               I got it.

                                                    8.


     Carrie screams with joy and shock. He laughs, thrilled.


17   EXT. NYC STREET/CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE -- DAY -- SUMMER 17

     Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte walk down the street.

                         CARRIE
               "I got it." Just like that. "I got
               it" -- like he was picking up the
               check for coffee or something.

                         CHARLOTTE
               It sounds perfect.

                         CARRIE
               Except for the closet which Big
               says he can redo -- also he says
               the kitchen needs work but I don't
               know about that `cause I keep
               sweaters in my stove.

     Carrie and Charlotte laugh.

                         MIRANDA
               So, he bought it -- and you're
               going to live there with him?

                         CARRIE
               Yes, together. That's right.

                         MIRANDA
               But he'll own it. So. You are
               keeping your own place, right?

                         CARRIE
               Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't
               figured out all the details yet,
               but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure
               I'll figure out something I'm
               comfortable with.

                         MIRANDA
               I just want to make sure you're
               being smart here --

                         CARRIE
               And I love you for it -- but for
               now can't you stop worrying for me
               and just go ahead and feel what I
               want you to feel. Jealous.

     Miranda smiles. Carrie puts her arm around her.

                                                    9.


                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Jealous of me living in this
               gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

                         MIRANDA
               Fine. I'm jealous. You're in real
               estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn.

                         CHARLOTTE
               New York magazine said Brooklyn is
               the new Manhattan.

                         MIRANDA
               Whoever wrote that - lives in
               Brooklyn.

                         CARRIE
               There she is. Hey Hollywood!

     Samantha is standing out in front of Christies. She waves to
     them -- as she finishes a call.

                         SAMANTHA
                   (on phone)
               Samantha Jones... Smith Jerrod's
               manager -- I'm in New York `till
               Monday.

     She hangs up; as they reach her.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               How was your flight?

                         SAMANTHA
               Fabulous. Let's go in -- I am so
               excited!


18   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE/LOBBY -- DAY -- MOMENTS LATER 8
                                                               1

     A lobby bustling with NEW YORK WOMEN. All types. Carrie,
     Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda make their way through them.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               It was a rare occasion that brought
               all types of women together. The
               socialites, the trendies the
               yuppies, the yentas.

     The girls gently move past by an elderly YENTA, who reacts.

                         YENTA
               Why the pushing?

                                                    9A.


18A   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE -- LATER                    18A

      Carrie and the girls enter a room filled with dramatically
      lit jewelry cases that display amazing jewelry. On the walls
      around the gallery are large photos of a BEAUTIFUL RAVEN
      HAIRED WOMAN (45). She is captured in candid poses "out and
      about" New York city at various social events wearing the
      jewelry on display.

                                              10.


                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Blair Elkenn was a waitress turned
          model turned actress turned
          billionaire's girlfriend who came
          home one night to find herself
          unceremoniously turned out on the
          street.

Samantha, Carrie and Charlotte page through the catalogues as
they walk. Miranda types on her Blackberry.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And now she was getting the
          ultimate break-up revenge. An
          embarrassing and very public
          auction of all the jewelry he had
          given her when they were happy.

The girls stop. Floating in a case at their eye level is a
unique, "two finger" FLOWER RING made out of diamonds.

                    SAMANTHA
          There it is. My baby.

                    CARRIE/BIG
          And she's a beauty.

                    SAMANTHA
          When I saw this in the catalogue I
          said to Smith: This flower ring is
          the essence of me. One of a kind,
          filled with fire...

                    CARRIE
          And a little too much.

                    SAMANTHA
          Exactly. Come on. Let's go spend
          some of my hard-earned Hollywood
          money.

They make their way to the auction room.

                    MIRANDA
          Hey -- what's coming up on Smith's
          series? Is he going to sleep with
          that new blonde neurosurgeon?

                    SAMANTHA
          He sleeps with every hot woman
          doctor in that hospital.

                                                   11.


                         MIRANDA
               Great. Can't wait.

                         CHARLOTTE
               Don't you ever get weirded out by
               seeing Smith in bed with all those
               other women?

                         SAMANTHA
               No, I think it's hot. Sometimes,
               when I'm alone, I masturbate right
               along with them.

                         CARRIE
               And people say the golden age of
               television is over.

                         SAMANTHA
               Besides, it's fake sex. When
               they're doing it -- no one's
               actually turned on.

                         MIRANDA
               Kinda like Steve and I.

     Miranda laughs. Everyone looks.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               I'm kidding.
                   (Beat; then)
               But come one-- it's been seven
               years. He does that, I do this...
               It's not like a new plot twist is
               going to turn up.


19   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE/AUCTION ROOM -- LATER        19

     A DISTINGUISHED WOMAN AUCTIONEER is at a podium.

                         AUCTIONEER
               Next item. The flower ring.

     Samantha sits up, ready. An electric buzz moves through the
     crowd.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               If Schadenfreude is the word for
               feeling pleasure at someone else
               misfortune -- This was
               "jewelryfreude."

                                              12.


                    AUCTIONEER
          Let's start the bidding at ten
          thousand.

Samantha raises her number. The Auctioneer nods.

                    AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Thank you madame. Do I hear
          fifteen?

A WOMAN IN A BUSINESS SUIT (40) on a phone, raises her
number. Samantha looks over at her.

                    SAMANTHA
          Bitch.

                    CARRIE
          And the gloves are off.

                    AUCTIONEER
          Do I hear twenty?

Samantha raises her number.

                    AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Twenty. Do I hear twenty-five?

The Woman raises her number.

                    AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Twenty-five. Thirty?

Samantha raises her number. Carrie's eyes widen.

                    AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Thirty-five?

The Woman is talking with someone on the phone.

                    MIRANDA
          She's bidding for someone on the
          phone.

                    CHARLOTTE
          That's not fair.

The Woman raises her hand. Charlotte gives her a look.

                    AUCTIONEER
          Thirty-five. Forty?

                    SAMANTHA
          I deserve this. I work hard.

                                                     13.


                         AUCTIONEER
               Do I hear forty?

     Samantha raises her hand.

                         AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
               Do I hear forty fi--

     The Woman quickly raises her hand. Auctioneer nods.

                         AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
               Fifty?

                         SAMANTHA
               Sex with only one man for I don't
               know how long.

                         AUCTIONEER
               Do I hear fifty thousand?

                         SAMANTHA
                   (Beat; loud)
               Fifty fucking thousand!

     A LAUGH ripples through the room. Samantha glares at the
     rival woman, almost daring her. Carrie looks afraid.

                         AUCTIONEER
               Fifty-five?

     The Woman raises her hand. Samantha reacts disappointed. The
     Auctioneer looks at Samantha.

                         AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
               Sixty? Sixty to our colorful
               bidder?

                         SAMANTHA
                   (to Carrie)
               I draw the line at fifty.

     Samantha shakes her head no. Carrie rubs her arm.


20   INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE/LADIES ROOM -- LATER           20

     Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are primping in front
     of the mirror.

                         CHARLOTTE
               I thought this auction would be
               more fun... but it's kinda sad.

                                                    14.


     A BABY VOICED WOMAN (45) next to Charlotte overhears.

                           BABY VOICED WOMAN
               Isn't it?

     They look over at her.

                         BABY VOICED WOMAN (CONT'D)
               I thought it was just sad for me
               `cause I know her. But it's really
               sad, huh? And it's funny cause they
               were so happy.

                         SAMANTHA
               ... Till they weren't

                         BABY VOICED WOMAN
               I know, right? We all told her to
               get married -- but she didn't want
               to push him. He'd been married
               three other times. So, she let it
               ride and then she came home one
               night and he had locked her out.
               She didn't even have anywhere to
               live. After ten years. Such a
               shame. She was a smart girl till
               she fell in love.

     Carrie catches Miranda's eye in the mirror, looks away.


21   INT. BIG'S SUBLET/KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                21

     Big takes a bright red lobster out of a pot of hot water with
     tongs. He places it next to another cooked lobster. He walks
     to the cooking island where Carrie sits; sipping wine.

                          BIG
               The creatures are ready. Just gonna
               sit there?

                         CARRIE
               I'm not sitting, I'm thinking.

                         BIG
               Here. Husk and think.

                                               15.


He winks -- puts two ears of corn in front of her, then
starts chopping tomatoes.

                    CARRIE
          I'm thinking I'm going to sell my
          apartment and put the money towards
          heaven on Fifth.

                    BIG
          Why? You love your place.

                    CARRIE
          I know but --

                      BIG
          But what?

                    CARRIE
          We're together ever night -- so I'm
          basically paying a mortgage on a
          glorified closet.

                    BIG
          You write there. It's your office.

                    CARRIE
          There's plenty of room at the new
          place and -- besides.. I want to
          make us -- a life there. I want it
          to be ours.

                    BIG
          It is ours. I bought it for us.

                    CARRIE
          And that's so amazing --but you
          bought it, so it's really your
          place. And -- if anything were to
          happen...

                    BIG
          What's going to happen?

                    CARRIE
          I have to be smart here. I mean,
          we're not married and I'd have no
          legal rights to... this home that I
          built... with you.

Silence. He thinks. Chops. She husks.

                    BIG
          Did you want to get married?

                                              16.


                    CARRIE
          I didn't think it was an option.

                     BIG
          Well, Mr. Bradshaw, what if it was
          an option?

She hits him with a husk. He smiles.

                    CARRIE
          Well, people are always assuming we
          are.

                    BIG
          And you know what happens when
          people assume. They make an ass out
          of who?

                    CARRIE
          You and me.

He smiles. She smiles. Chop. Chop.

                    BIG
          What do you think, kid?

                    CARRIE
          Why -- Do you want to get married?

                    BIG
          Well, I wouldn't mind be married to
          you. Would you mind being married
          to me?

                    CARRIE
          No, if that's what you want. Is
          that what you want?

                    BIG
          I want you. So. Okay.

                    CARRIE
          Okay. Really? We're getting
          married.

                     BIG
          We're getting married.
              (Beat)
          Should we get you a diamond?

                    CARRIE
          No, please, don't get me a diamond.
              (Beat; then)
          Get me a really big closet.

                                             16A.


                    BIG
          Deal.

He puts out his hand. She takes it and they shake.

                    BIG (CONT'D)
          But... You gotta do better on that
          corn. Look at all the stuff left on
          there.

She looks down at her corn, he's right. She nods.

                                                    17.


22   INT. MODERN RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SUMMER                      22

     Crowded; serious lunch crowd. Carrie sits across from
     Charlotte and Miranda. Miranda is in a work suit.

                         CARRIE
               So, the other night, Big and I were
               talking about, you know, moving in
               together and our future...

     Charlotte's eyes are getting wider and wider.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               ... And about what makes sense as
               we move forward. And, well... we
               decided to get married.

     Charlottes SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Carrie and
     Miranda and the ENTIRE RESTAURANT REACT.

                         MIRANDA
               ... and I'm deaf.

                         CARRIE
               Everyone's looking

     Charlotte looks around at the DISGRUNTLED FACES. She half-
     stands and address the DINERS looking at her.

                         CHARLOTTE
               Sorry! I'm sorry... but my friend
               here, just got engaged and she's
               been going out with the man for ten
               years.

     The DINERS bursts into APPLAUSE. Carrie slumps in her chair,
     pulls up her sweater collar, turns to Miranda.

                         CARRIE
               I am mortified.

                         MIRANDA
               There is literally a ringing in my
               ear.


23   INT. SAMANTHA JONES MANAGEMENT -- DAY                        23

     A large PHOTO of Smith. Samantha walks past it and up a
     sleek, modern office building stairway. Her cell rings.

                                                   18.


                         SAMANTHA
               Samantha Jones--


24   INT. FENDI -- LATER -- SUMMER                               24

     Intercut with Carrie walking through the upscale boutique
     talking on her pink Swarovski crystal-covered cell phone.

                         CARRIE
               Well... I made a little decision
               that I hope you'll be happy about.

                         SAMANTHA
               Oh, honey... you finally got Botox.

                         CARRIE
               No. I did not get Botox

                         SAMANTHA
               I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll
               love it.

                         CARRIE
               I did not call to talk about Botox.

                         SAMANTHA
               I'm just saying.

     Samantha reaches the top of the stairs. Blow-ups of Smith on
     various magazine covers line the walls of the chic, small
     office space.

                         CARRIE
               So... Last week, after the auction,
               I started thinking about my
               options.

                         SAMANTHA
               Right.

                         CARRIE
               Right, and... well, Big and I
               decided to get married.

                         SAMANTHA
               Really?

                         CARRIE
               Yes.

                         SAMANTHA
               That's great.

                                                   19.


                         CARRIE
               You sounded more excited about the
               botox.

                         SAMANTHA
               Well, honey -- I am excited for you
               but -- you know me... I don't
               really believe in marriage....
               Botox on the other hand -- That
               works every time.

     A RECEPTIONIST (23) hands her some messages.

                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
               Honey, I've got to go. The People
               magazine person is on hold. Smith's
               on the short list to be their
               "Sexiest Man Alive." We can catch
               up when I'm in town next week.

     Samantha hangs up. Carrie looks at her phone: dismissed and
     disappointed. She closes it and walks on.


25   INT. FENDI -- A LITTLE LATER                               25

     Carrie rounds a corner. Her phone rings.

                            CARRIE
               Hello?


26   INT. SAMANTHA JONES MANAGEMENT -- CONTINUOUS               26

     Intercut with Samantha standing in her office.

                         SAMANTHA
               I think I was in shock. I mean,
               it's you getting married. This is
               not some random person -- it's you.

                            CARRIE
               I hear ya.

                         SAMANTHA
               And I guess, I thought that after
               that big mess with Aidan -- you'd
               never want to get married.

                            CARRIE
               I know.

                                           19A.


                  SAMANTHA
        So, I put you in my "we're never
        getting married" file. Now, I've
        got to take you out of that file.

                  CARRIE
        Sorry about the extra paper work.

                  SAMANTHA
        You'll get my bill.

                  CARRIE
        Samantha, it feels so different
        this time. No cliché romantic
        kneeling down on one knee. Just you
        know, two grown-ups -- making a
        decision about spending their lives
        together.

                                                   20.


                         SAMANTHA
               Well, I'm happy for you.

                         CARRIE
               And one more thing... I want you to
               be maid of honor. How do you feel
               about that?

                         SAMANTHA
               The same way you feel about Botox.
               Painful and unnecessary.

     Carrie laughs. Samantha shrugs.


27   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SUMMER                   27

     Carrie and Charlotte sit on her bed looking through a list of
     names. ANTHONY sits at her makeup vanity. He has a large
     notebook open in front of him.

                         CHARLOTTE
               74, 75, 76.... Seventy-six guests.

                         ANTHONY
               Seventy five sounds better. "A
               small, wedding of seventy five
               guests."

     Carrie looks at the list.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               As a wedding gift, Charlotte had
               given me Anthony Marantino --
               friend and wedding planner.

     Carrie crosses someone off. Charlotte reacts, shocked.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               What? She was borderline anyway.

                                              21.


                    ANTHONY
          Cut throat -- I love it. I hope
          you're that decisive when it comes
          to the location and the dress.

                    CARRIE
          Oh. I found the dress.

                    CHARLOTTE
          What?! When?

                    CARRIE
          The other day. I have it here.

Carrie gets up and goes into the closet. Anthony hurries over
and sits next to Charlotte.

                    ANTHONY
          This is going to be good!

                    CHARLOTTE
          I'm so excited!

                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          Here it is.

Anthony and Charlotte grab hands in anticipation as Carrie
comes out of her closet. She holds up a simple OFF-WHITE
VINTAGE SUIT. Charlotte and Anthony deflate.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Well... that was the exact reaction
          I was aiming for.

                    CHARLOTTE
          No, it's pretty but it's so --
          simple.

                    CARRIE
          Simple and classic. When I saw it I
          just thought: That is what I should
          marry Big in.

                    ANTHONY
          Well, who's it by? The label?

                    CARRIE
          No one. I found it in a vintage
          shop.

                    ANTHONY
          "The bride wore a dress by no one."

                                                   22.


     She turns and heads back into the closet.

                         CARRIE
                   (As she goes)
               Don't worry, I'll style it up with
               shoes.

     Anthony turns to Charlotte and says in a low voice.

                         ANTHONY
               The invitation is fancier than the
               dress.

                         CARRIE (O.C.)
               I heard that.


28   INT. BROOKLYN RESTAURANT -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                  28

     A "family style" Italian restaurant. Miranda, in business
     clothes, sits with Steve, Brady and MAGDA. Brady's face is
     covered in spaghetti sauce.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               And from Anthony Marantino to
               spaghetti marinara.

                         MIRANDA
               Where is he with the check?

                         STEVE
               Geese, Miranda -- relax. Magda's
               not even finished yet.

                         MIRANDA
               I still have a legal brief to work
               on when I get home.

                         BRADY
               I have to go to the bathroom.

                         MAGDA
               I'll take him. Wash that beautiful
               face too, yes?

     Brady nods. Magda walks away with Brady. Miranda is packing
     up Brady's action figures. Steve gives her a look.

                         MIRANDA
               What? I'm sorry. I'm exhausted.
               Brady woke me up at five AM.

                                                     23.


                         STEVE
               He woke me up too.

     Silence. She sips her cappuccino. Foam covers her top lip. He
     looks over at her and smiles.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               You got milk on your top lip.

     She licks it off, not pleased.

                           STEVE (CONT'D)
               What now?

                         MIRANDA
               It's like you're always criticizing
               me.

                          STEVE
               I am not.
                    (Beat; then, cute)
               You want to go through life with
               foam on your lip and no one telling
               you?

     Silence. He reaches down and picks up her coffee cup and
     sips... putting lots of foam on his lip. He looks over.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               Anything you want to tell me?

     She shakes her head: No. He puts his face in front of hers.
     She laughs. He licks his lip.


29   INT. MIRANDA AND STEVE'S BEDROOM -- LATER                    29

     Steve is in bed with Miranda, they are making love. She is
     wearing a T-shirt.

                         MIRANDA
               Yeah. Yeah.

                          STEVE
               Wait --- wait -- Don't come
               already...

                         MIRANDA
               Yeah. Yeah.

                         STEVE
               Wait, wait -- get on top.    Get on --

                                                     24.


                         MIRANDA
               It's late... let's just get it over
               with.

     Steve looks at her. She can't believe what she's said.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               I mean -- We have to get up in four
               and half hours.

                         STEVE
               We never have sex and you want to
               get it over with?

                         MIRANDA
               Steve... We have sex.

                         STEVE
               When was the last time we had sex?

     Miranda can't remember. He moves to his side of the bed.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
                   (As he turns away)
               There was snow on the ground.

     He gets out of the bed and walks away. She watches him go.


30   INT. COFFEE SHOP -- DAY -- SUMMER                            30

     The girls are having breakfast. Lily sits at the table in a
     booster seat coloring in a Cinderella coloring book. Carrie
     is helping her. CLOSE ON: Cinderella's shoe. Carrie is
     filling it in with a BLUE CRAYON.

                         MIRANDA
               How often do you guys have sex?

                         CHARLOTTE
               Miranda -- please.

                         MIRANDA
               What?

     She indicates that Lily is sitting with Carrie. Carrie
     continues to color, not looking up.

                         CARRIE
               It's okay, I know all about sex.

                                           24A.


                  SAMANTHA
        If I knew the girl talk was going
        to be on "lock down," I wouldn't
        have flown two thousand miles.

                                              25.


                     CHARLOTTE
          No, we can talk, let's just not use
          that word.

                    MIRANDA
          She's three, she doesn't know what
          it means. I'm forty- two and I
          still don't know what it means.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I know, but she's repeating
          everything.

                    MIRANDA
          Fine. How often do you guys...

                    CARRIE
          ... "Color"?

                       CHARLOTTE
          Thank-you.

                    SAMANTHA
          Well, I can't color enough. I would
          color all day -- every day if I had
          my way. I'd use every crayon in my
          box.

                    CARRIE
          We get it. You love to color.
              (To Miranda)
          Why are you asking?

                    MIRANDA
          Steve and I were "coloring" last
          night and just as I was about to --

Miranda is searching for a word she can use.

                    SAMANTHA
          Come?
              (beat; to Charlotte)
          Sorry -- there is no crayon
          equivalent.

                    MIRANDA
          He wanted to change positions and I
          said... "Let's just get it over
          with."

The ladies react, three different shades of shocked.

                                           25A.


                  MIRANDA (CONT'D)
        Well, he kept trying to make it
        last longer.

                  SAMANTHA
        And this is bad?

                                              26.


                    MIRANDA
          It is when you have a full-time
          job.

                    SAMANTHA
          I have a full-time job.

                    MIRANDA
          Well, you don't also have a five
          year old and play groups and PTA
          and a mother-in-law in a rest home
          with advancing Alzheimer's. I'm
          telling you, at the end of the day
          all I want to do is sleep. The most
          exciting thing in bed now -- is the
          bed.

                    CARRIE
          So... Sleep is the new sex?

                    LILY
          Sex.

                    CHARLOTTE
          See.

                    CARRIE
          -- I meant coloring.

                    MIRANDA
          We're just going through a no
          coloring phase -- it comes and
          goes, right?

                    CHARLOTTE
          Every couple is different. Harry
          and I --

Carrie and Samantha look over; interested.

                    CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
          ... Make love two or three times a
          week.

                    MIRANDA
          Great. Now I feel worse.

                    SAMANTHA
          Well, when was the last time for
          you?

                    MIRANDA
          Six months ago.

                                                    27.


                          CARRIE
                Oh my.

      Miranda looks at her. She -- continues to color.

                          MIRANDA
                But that's a dry spell.

                          SAMANTHA
                I bet it is.

                          CHARLOTTE
                What about you and Big, Carrie?
                    (Off her look)
                Come on, I told.

                          CARRIE
                Never. But, I will tell you this.
                When Big colors --
                    (Beat; sexy)
                He rarely stays inside the lines.

      Samantha whoops. Carrie resumes coloring.

                          MIRANDA
                Well, this was very helpful.


30A   INT. BEACHOUSE/BATHROOM -- SUNSET -- SUMMER               30A

      A freshly-showered Samantha sits on a chaise lounge in a robe
      -- talking on the phone.

                          SAMANTHA
                Send it to Smith Jerrod at the
                office address.

      Smith walks up to Samantha wearing only underwear. There is a
      huge bulge in the front. Samantha takes the bulge in.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone)
                I've got to go. Something just came
                up.

      She hangs up. He smiles, looks down at her.

                          SMITH
                I've got a gift for you.

                          SAMANTHA
                So far, I like it.

                                             27A.


He smiles as she reaches INTO his underwear basket and
removes a long black velvet jewelry case. She opens it. It's
the petal ring from the auction.

                    SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          How did -- Wait -- that was you on
          the phone at the auction?

                    SMITH
          I knew how much you wanted it.

                    SAMANTHA
          But I was going to buy it for
          myself.

                     SMITH
          I wanted to give it to you... for
          our anniversary. We met five years
          ago today.

                    SAMANTHA
              (beat; had no idea)
          Right.

He smiles, sits down on the bed.

                    SMITH
          Do you like it?

                    SAMANTHA
          To be clear -- This is a ring with
          diamonds -- not a diamond ring,
          right?
              (Off his nod)
          In that case... I love it.
              (Re; underwear)
          It's my second favorite thing I've
          ever found in there.

She kisses him, touched -- then reaches in his underwear.

                    SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          Now, my gift's a little bit more...
          oral.

                    SMITH
          Babe -- I've got to go to bed.

                    SAMANTHA
          Bed? It's seven-thirty.

                                                     27B.


                          SMITH
                I have to be at the studio by six
                A.M. and I need to get a workout
                before that.

                          SAMANTHA
                This is how it starts. Next thing
                you know... we're only having sex
                three or four times a week.

                          SMITH
                Most people consider that normal.

                          SAMANTHA
                I am not most people.

                          SMITH
                No - you most certainly are not.

      He smiles, leans in and gives her a hot -- hot kiss. The kiss
      leads -- to reaching into underwear... as they start.


30B   INT. BEACHOUSE/ BEDROOM -- NIGHT                            30B

      Smith is laying in bed. Sound asleep. The clock on the bed
      table reads: 9:01.


30C   EXT. BEACHOUSE/JACUZZI -- CONTINUOUS                        30C

      Night. Samantha sits in the jacuzzi wearing her ring --
      sipping a glass of wine -- bored.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                One glass of Merlot and two orgasms
                later.

      Samantha hears MOANING. The sounds of someone having SEX in
      the house right next door. She looks -- from the hot tub she
      can see her neighbor DANTE -- hot, dark -- "sex on a stick"
      in his living room making wild love to a RED HAIRED WOMAN.
      They are naked. Samantha watches and sips -- not so bored.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And that is how Samantha learned
                she had a new neighbor.


31    INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                         31

      Carrie enters the apartment.   It is dark-ish. A candle or two
      is lit.

                                                    27C.


                             CARRIE
                    (soft)
                John?

      The terrace doors are open. The curtains blow, gently.   She
      walks out onto it.


31A   EXT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS                            31A

      As she steps out onto the terrace. Big comes up behind her.
      He -- leans her against the door jamb and kisses her. It's
      hot. He kisses her -- sliding down the front of her body.


32    INT. BIG'S SUBLET/BEDROOM-- LATER -- SUMMER                  32

      Big is in bed wearing "half glasses," reading The Wall Street
      Journal. Carrie enters from the bathroom and hops into bed.
      She grabs a LIBRARY BOOK from the night stand and looks over.

                             CARRIE
                Lean?

      He nods and lifts up one of his arms. She slides over and
      nestles in, leaning up against him. She opens her book. He
      looks down at it.

                          BIG
                Are you the last person in New York
                still taking out library books?

                                                28.


                    CARRIE
          I love the smell.

She smells the book, then holds it up to him. He smells.

                    BIG
          That's an old one.

                    CARRIE
          "The Love Letters of Great Men."
          Volume one.

                    BIG
          Am I in there?

                    CARRIE
          No, but some of your classmates
          are. Voltaire, Napoleon...

Big smiles. She takes the glasses off his face and puts them
on, looks at book.

                    BIG
          You need to get glasses.

                    CARRIE
          No, I don't -- you have them.
              (then; off book)
          Here's Napoleon...
              (Reads)
          "My dearest Josephine, I wake
          consumed with thoughts of you --"

                    BIG
          Typical short guy. Gives it all
          away up front.

She punches him a little, continues to read.

                    BIG (CONT'D)
          Why are you reading this?

                    CARRIE
          Research for my new book.

                    BIG
          What's it about?

                    CARRIE
          Love. I use to write about finding
          love-- now I want to write about
          what happens after you've found it.

                                           28A.


                  BIG
        Interesting. What happens?

                  CARRIE
        Stay tuned.

                                              29.


He smiles. She looks at the book again.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Listen... Here's Beethoven.

                    BIG
          Bring it, Ludwig.

                    CARRIE
              (Reading)
          "My thoughts go out to you today my
          immortal beloved. I can live only
          wholly with you or not at all."

                    BIG
          Good stuff.

                    CARRIE
              (Reading)
          "Be calm my life, my all. Only by
          calm consideration of our existence
          can we achieve our purpose to live
          together. Oh continue to love me,
          never misjudge the most faithful
          heart of your beloved. Ever thine --
          ever mine -- ever ours.

Silence. The beautiful sentiment hangs in the air. She closes
the book and looks up at him.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Have you ever written me a love
          letter?

                    BIG
          Does a love fax count?

                    CARRIE
          When have I ever gotten a love fax?

                    BIG
          I'm pretty sure my secretary sent
          one at some point.

Carrie looks at him, mock disappointed.

                     BIG (CONT'D)
          What can I say, baby? Not my
          style.
              (Beat)
          Besides, these guys had to write--
          they were separated from their
          loves by wars and hundreds of
          miles. I'm right here.
                     (MORE)

                                                     30.

                              BIG (CONT'D)
                     (Beat)
               Hi.

     She smiles. He kisses her on the forehead. Sincere.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               You make me very happy.

                         CARRIE
               Yeah, yeah.... Put it in writing.

     He laughs, she looks at her book, turns a page and reads.
     After a beat, he puts down his paper.

                          BIG
               Alright. Here's a love letter from
               me to you.

     She looks up at him, excited. He speaks romantically.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Loving you. Is easy... `cause your
               beautiful...

     Big continues --   now SINGING the Minnie Ripperton classic.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE
               IS FILLED WITH LOVING YOU. LA LA LA
               LA LA LA LA OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

     Carrie LAUGHS as he continues to massacre the high notes.


33   EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -      DAY -- SUMMER            33

     Carrie runs past the stone lions and up the grand stairs
     holding three LIBRARY BOOKS in her hand.


34   INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY/LOBBY -- LATER -- SUMMER        34

     Carrie stands at the entrance while a FEMALE GUARD (60)
     checks the contents of her purse. A FLORAL DELIVERY MAN comes
     in carrying a GORGEOUS ARRANGEMENT OF WHITE FLOWERS. He calls
     to the Guard.

                         DELIVERY MAN
               Which way's the wedding?

     The Guard points, bored. Carrie looks, interested.

                                                  30A.


35   INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY/WEDDING SPACE -- MOMENTS LATER 5
                                                               3

     A beautiful space. The tables are being set up as MORE
     FLOWERS arrive. Carrie tip-toes in and looks around. A SMILE
     grows on her face.

                                                   31.


36   INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                         36

     Carrie and Big sit at the bar -- having dinner.

                         CARRIE
               I've been thinking.

                         BIG
               Again?

                         CARRIE
               How about we get married at The New
               York Public Library?
                   (Gushy and silly)
               Think how perfect. You and I and
               our love story surrounded by all
               the other lesser love stories.

                         BIG
               Do we have to make that big of a
               deal?

                         CARRIE
               It's not that big a deal. It's
               seventy-five people in a room
               that's partitioned in half.

                         BIG
               It's just -- I've already had two
               big weddings.

     Carrie winces -- stung. After a beat, she goes on.

                         CARRIE
               Well, what did you have in mind?

                         BIG
               I don't know -- a judge, couple
               friends and then we go for ham and
               eggs after.

     A bucket of cold water.

                         CARRIE
               Interesting.

     Big looks over at her. She looks upset, hurt, sad. Silence.

                         BIG
               Would we have to whisper? In the
               library?

                                              32.


Carrie looks over at him, softens a little.

                    BIG (CONT'D)
          "Do you, Carrie" -- Shhhh. "Take
          this man" -- SHHHH!

He raises his eyebrow. She laughs. ELAINE (40) Zaftig, Jewish
-- spots Carrie.

                    ELAINE
          Carrie, hi!

                    CARRIE
          Elaine, hi. Do you know John?

                    ELAINE
          No, hi. Nice to meet you.

                    CARRIE
          Elaine writes a single gal column
          for The New York Post.

                    ELAINE
          Please -- I'd rather you reveal my
          weight.

Carrie and Big laugh.

                    ELAINE (CONT'D)V.O.)
          So, what's new?

                    CARRIE
          Well. We're getting married.

                    BIG
          Yep -- At the New York Public
          Library.

Carrie looks at Big, touched. Elaine is delighted, TEARFUL.

                    ELAINE
          Oh, my God! This gives me such
          hope.

She hugs Carrie, then hugs Big. Then hugs Big again.

                    ELAINE (CONT'D)
          Thank-you. Thank-you for marrying
          someone our age.

                                                    33.


37   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/DINING ROOM -- DAY -- SUMMER     37

     Charlotte, Harry and Lily are having breakfast. A KING
     CHARLES SPANIEL and TWO MUTTS sit on the floor looking up at
     them. Charlotte pages through the New York Post -- She
     notices something. CLOSE ON: NEWSPAPER; A small PHOTO: of
     Carrie on "PAGE SIX" above a mention of the wedding.
     Charlotte SCREAMS. Harry and Lily JUMP. She grabs the
     cordless phone from the table.


38   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- MOMENTS LATER                          38

     Intercut with Carrie on the phone as Big sips coffee.

                         CHARLOTTE
                   (reading paper)
               "The ultimate single gal Carrie
               Bradshaw will be married in Manolos
               to New York financier John James
               Preston come fall."

                         CARRIE
                   (to Big)
               Our wedding's on Page Six.

                         BIG
                   (not pleased)
               Who would put that in there?

     Carrie shrugs, Charlotte continues reading.

                         CHARLOTTE
               "Proving to single gals everywhere
               that there can be a happy ending
               over forty."

                         CARRIE
               Oh, I know who.


39   EXT. NYC STREET -- DAY -- LATER -- SUMMER                   39

     Carrie is walking down the street with STANFORD.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               Later that day, I met my friend
               Stanford for our weekly quick lunch
               and gossip session... Also known
               as "dish then dash."

                                               33A.


                    STANFORD
          According to a certain trashy tome,
          you are marrying John James
          Preston.

                    CARRIE
          Rumor has it.

                    STANFORD
          Just one question: Does Big know?

                    CARRIE
              (laughs; then)
          Where are we eating?

                    STANFORD
          Anywhere you like... and you know
          the rule -- the person on Page Six
          pays for lunch.

Carrie laughs. TWO WOMEN spot her and scream.   She and
Stanford REACT as the women GUSH.

                                                      34.


40   INT. RESTAURANT -- LATER -- SUMMER                            40

     Carrie and Stanford are mid-meal. Three GAY MALE friends (3O-
     40) stand at their table and gush.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               It seemed everywhere I went...
               people I knew were excited and
               available to come to the wedding.

     A WAITRESS (23) places a check on the table.    Stanford looks
     at it, then leans in to waitress.

                         STANFORD
               You forgot to charge us for the
               gaggle of gays.


41   EXT. STREET -- LATER -- SUMMER                                41

     Carrie and Stanford are walking by a nail salon as BITSY VON
     MUFFLING, socialite, comes running out -- Mid-pedicure. She
     is barefoot with foam pads stuck between her painted toes.

                         BITSY
               Carrie Bradshaw Preston! Carrie
               Bradshaw Preston!

     Carrie and Stanford stop -- turn around.    Bitsy gushes.

                         BITSY (CONT'D)
               Mazel tov! Saw you on Page Six!
               September? October? When?
                   (beat; realizes feet)
               Look! Will you look! I got so
               excited -- no shoes. I'm standing
               barefoot on a New York sidewalk
               probably getting trichinoses.

     She hurries away, turning back to CALL as she goes.

                         BITSY (CONT'D)
               We're at the same address --
               different floor. Just send it --
               they'll get us the invite.

     She waves, goes back inside.   Carrie looks stunned.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               The shocking thing was not the
               plethora of empty autumn social
               calenders but knowledge that
               everyone does indeed read Page Six.

                                                   34A.


41A   INT. VOGUE OFFICES/RECEPTION AREA -- DAY -- SUMMER         41A

      Carrie opens the glass door and walks into the Vogue offices.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Even people you didn't expect, like
                my Vogue editor, Enid.


42    INT. VOGUE OFFICES/ENID'S OFFICE -- LATER                  42

      Carrie is with ENID (60) her stunning, icy Vogue editor.

                          ENID
                We're putting together our annual
                "Age" issue -- and we'd like you to
                do forty.

                          CARRIE
                Great. Who am I interviewing?

                          ENID
                No. You. You are forty. I want you
                to be featured in the magazine as
                the forty year old -- and here's
                the brilliant twist -- bride.

                          CARRIE
                Wait -- I would be in the magazine?

                                              35.


                    ENID
          In bridal couture. It's a once in a
          lifetime opportunity - so spare me
          a week of faux soul-searching and
          just say yes.

                    CARRIE
          Enid -- I'm so very flattered but--

                     ENID
          Carrie. Vogue designers, Vogue
          photographers, Vogue airbrushing.
              (Beat)
          Nod your head: yes.

Carrie smiles and nods.

                    ENID (CONT'D)
          Thank-you. It will be a sensation.
          We're calling it: "The Last Single
          Girl."

                    CARRIE
          Well, I'm hardly the last single
          girl.

                    ENID
          No, but forty is the last age you
          can see a woman photographed in a
          wedding gown without the unintended

                    CARRIE
          I thought the issue was "great
          style at every age."

                    ENID
          Style yes... bride no.

                    CARRIE
              (smiles; then)
          Enid -- I have no idea -- were you
          ever married?

                    ENID
          Briefly. In 1975. I wore Halston.
          Creme. One shoulder Grecian with a
          low-cut bodice to the waistline for
          a dramatic flair. The fabric in the
          sleeves formed oval draping on the
          sides. Stunning. My future husband
          and I saw it on a trip to Paris and
          he fell in love with it.

                                           35A.

                  ENID (CONT'D)
        Insisted I be married in it. So I
        was. We had quite a beautiful
        party.

                  CARRIE
            (smiles; then delicately)
        Why didn't the marriage work out?

                  ENID
        Did you not hear me say my husband
        fell in love with my gown?
            (beat; off Carrie's nod)
        Has your fiancée expressed any
        interest in what you'll be wearing?

                  CARRIE
        None at all.

                  ENID
        Then you may have a shot.

                                                       36.


43    INT. VOGUE PHOTO SHOOT SET -- DAY -- SUMMER                   43

      Carrie stands on the set of a Vogue photo shoot wearing a
      GORGEOUS VERA WANG GOWN. Hair, make-up: stunning. She is
      surrounded by VOGUE STYLISTS and CREW. Carrie looks over to
      Samantha, Stanford and Charlotte standing on the side-lines,
      watching. They signal their approval. Carrie smiles...
      tentative -- but excited.

                           SAMANTHA
                 She's looking quite at home for
                 someone who didn't think she had
                 the bride gene.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Well, I guess with the right man...

                           STANFORD
                 ... And the right dress.

      Charlotte and Samantha smile.

                           STANFORD (CONT'D)
                 When I get married, I'm wearing
                 something like that. But bigger.

      Samantha and Charlotte laugh. The PHOTOGRAPHER starts
      working. FLASH! Carrie poses. FLASH!

                           CARRIE (V.O.)

      Samantha holds up her iPhone and takes a photograph of
      Carrie. Charlotte looks at it, smiles, then presses --
      "send."

      picks it up -- CLOSE ON: PHONE announcing a photo arrival.
      She opens the photo - it's Carrie in the wedding dress.
      Miranda smiles.

                And for dessert -- Vivienne
                Westwood.

                                                        37.


        Charlotte and Stanford are looking at Carrie, moved.

                            CARRIE (CONT'D)
                  A confection so special...

        Samantha reaches up and wipes away a tear.

                            CARRIE (CONT'D)
                  ... It could wring a wedding tear
                  from even the most unbelieving of
                  women.


44      INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SUMMER                     44

        Carrie opens the door to find a DELIVERY MAN standing there
        with a very large dress box tied by a lush RIBBON.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  And then the impossible happened.

        JUMP CUT TO: Carrie pulling back the tissue paper to reveal:
        her favorite wedding gown. Carrie picks up a hand-written
        note on an engraved note card from VIVIENNE WESTWOOD. It
        reads: "I saw the photos from the shoot. This dress belongs
        to you. Cheers!"


45      INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/CLOSET -- LATER -- SUMMER            45

        Carrie peeks around the closet and looks in. The gown is
        hanging next to the white suit, dwarfing it.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  And just like that, Vivienne
                  Westwood kicked my sweet little
                  suit's ass.


49   INT. PENTHOUSE/BEDROOM -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER               49

     Big leads Carrie into their new bedroom by the hand. Her eyes
     are closed and she has a DESIGNER shopping bag slung over her
     one arm. He moves her around the construction debris,
     stopping in front of the new closet's double doors.

                         BIG
               Okay. Open them.

     Carrie opens her eyes.

                         CARRIE
               Double door. So far so good.

                                                    40.


     She opens the closet doors, revealing a beautiful oversized,
     walk-in closet with shelves and more shelves and places for
     shoes and more shoes.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Well. You did me proud, Mister.

                          BIG
               Like it?

                         CARRIE
               Like it? It's love at first sight.

     He smiles, proud. She takes the DESIGNER shoe box out of her
     shopping bag and hands it to him. She opens the lid, takes
     out a pair of COLORFUL/FUN HEELS and places them on the
     shelf. She turns back to him.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Now, I believe this is all really
               happening.


50   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER               50

     Miranda, Charlotte and Carrie are standing in Carrie's
     apartment. Empty boxes are everywhere. Lily is coloring
     quietly nearby.

                         MIRANDA
               I can't believe it sold so fast.

                         CHARLOTTE
               It's a sign.

                         CARRIE
               Yeah, a sign I priced it too low.

     The door buzzes. Carrie pushes the intercom button.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
               That's the food -- money on the
               table.
                   (Beat)
               I'll get started in the closet... I
               should be done in seventeen years.

     Carrie starts into the bathroom. Charlotte calls:

                         CHARLOTTE
               Pink Post-it -- take. Purple --
               toss. Yellow: Storage.

                                                     41.


                         CARRIE (O.C)
                   (Calling out)
               You're good friends.

     There is a knock on the door. Miranda opens it. Samantha
     stands there with her carry-on luggage.

                         CHARLOTTE
               Samantha! Oh my God!

     Carrie re-enters from the bathroom... stunned.

                         CARRIE
               What are you doing here?!

                         SAMANTHA
               I lot of shit went down in this
               place. Attention must be payed!

     She reaches into her bag and pulls out a bottle of champagne.
     They all CHEER. She reaches in again and pulls out another
     bottle. More cheering.


51   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- LATER                     51

     Samantha is packing Carrie's collection of CD's, tapes and
     albums. She puts on a "Best of the 80's" CD.

     MUSIC START: Run DMC & Aerosmith: "WALK THIS WAY."

     Carrie comes   out of her closet wearing an outfit that screams
     "80's." Lily   looks up from her coloring. Miranda, Charlotte
     and Samantha   sit on the bed drinking champagne. Carrie poses.
     They hold up   hand-written signs: "Take" or "Toss."

     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie comes out of the closet wearing another
     "80's" outfit. The girls vote: "Take, Take, Toss." Carrie
     nods.

     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie comes out of the closet wearing a tight
     pink top and a tutu. The girls LAUGH; then all hold up:
     "Toss." Carrie reacts.

     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie comes out wearing a late "90's" outfit.
     The girls vote: "Take, Take, Take." Carrie is thrilled - she
     keeps it.

     JUMP CUT TO: Miranda wearing something from Carrie's closet.

     JUMP CUT TO: Charlotte wearing something from Carrie's
     closet.

     JUMP CUT TO: Samantha wearing something from Carrie's closet.

                                                  41A.


     JUMP CUT TO: Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha LAUGHING
     -- at something. REVEAL: Lily standing in the closet, naked
     except for her training underpants. Her arms are outstretched
     and draped with Carrie's small purses and bags.


52   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER             52

     The girls in the apartment are surrounded by many, boxes.

                                                   42.


                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               It took four friends, three days to
               put twenty years into twenty-eight
               boxes.


53   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER                53

     Carrie walks through her now, empty apartment. She takes one
     last long look and leaves. END MUSIC.


54   INT. REST HOME -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER                         54

     Steve sits in a chair as Miranda hands a cup of tea to his
     mother MARY. She looks up at Miranda, lost.

                         MARY
               Who are you again?

                         MIRANDA
               Oh, you know me -- I'm your
               daughter-in-law.
                   (beat; then)
               I'm Miranda.

                         MARY
               That's right.

     Miranda nods and smiles. Steve watches, touched.


55   INT. MIRANDA AND STEVE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- LT. SUMMER
                                                               55

     Miranda is putting away groceries. Steve is sitting at the
     kitchen table.

                         MIRANDA
               While I run over to see your mother
               tomorrow maybe you can take him to
               the first birthday party alone.
               Then -- I'll meet you at the twins'
               party and you can leave and be at
               the bar by six.

     She looks over at him. He looks strange.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               What's the matter? Steve.

     He starts crying.

                         STEVE
               -- I had sex with someone else.

                                                   43.


     Miranda can't believe her ears.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               -- And you are so amazing with Ma
               and everything... everything you do
               and I can't believe I would do that
               to you.

     Miranda just sits -- looking at him.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               You and I hadn't had sex in a
               really long time and I --

     Miranda shakes her head, turns and walks out of the kitchen.
     He gets up and follows her.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               It didn't mean anything -- It was
               just once... and it's been killing
               me.

     She stops and turns around. He stops.

                         MIRANDA
               It's killing you?!

     She starts down the hall again. He's on her heels.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
               It just happened... I wasn't
               thinking.

                         MIRANDA
               Do not follow me.

     She starts up the stairs. He stops at the bottom and watches
     her go. Lost as to what to do next.


56   INT. BIG SUBLET -- A LITTLE LATER -- LATE SUMMER           56

     Carrie opens the door. Miranda stands there with Brady. She
     looks like she is about to burst into tears. Big stands in
     the hall behind Carrie. Unsure.

                         CARRIE
               Hi.

                         MIRANDA
               Surprise -- Here we are!

                                                     44.


                         CARRIE
                   (To Brady)
               Well, I'm so excited you are here
               for a sleepover.

                         MIRANDA
               We are too. Aren't we B-boy?

     Brady nods. Miranda gives Brady's hand to Carrie.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               Here. Mommy has to go to the
               bathroom.

     Miranda hurries away. Carrie looks after her, concerned.

                         CARRIE
               Brady, do you want to go have some
               peanut butter?

     He nods. Carrie give his hand to Big and hurries away. Big
     looks at Brady. Brady looks up at him.

                         BIG
               Peanut butter it is.

     They walk into the kitchen.


57   INT. BIG SUBLET/POWDER ROOM -- A LITTLE LATER                57

     Miranda is sitting on the toilet, seat down. Carrie at the
     sink.

                         MIRANDA
               Apparently you don't have sex for
               six months he runs out and has it
               with some girl at his bar.

                         CARRIE
               Steve. I can't believe it. Steve.

                         MIRANDA
               Steve. When I think of everything
               I've done for him. And this is how
               he repays me. Man, if I didn't have
               Brady, I would never go back there.

     Miranda looks furious. Carrie nods, in shock.

                                                     45.


58   INT. MIRANDA AND STEVE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER     58

     Steve is in bed. Miranda comes in, dressed for bed.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  The next night, for the sake of
                  Brady, Miranda went against her
                  instincts and went home.

     He throws back the covers. She looks at him.

                            STEVE
                  Miranda, it's still me.

                            MIRANDA
                  Is it?

     She stands there and looks at him. Shakes her head, exits.


59   INT. MERCER HOTEL/LOBBY -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER              59

     Miranda walks into the chic hotel lobby holding Brady's hand.
     She pulls a piece of luggage behind her.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  So Miranda left Brooklyn and came
                  home... to Manhattan.


60   INT. MERCER HOTEL LOBBY/RESTAURANT -- DAY -- LATE SUMMER     60

     Brady sits   on a couch in the lobby playing with his action
     figures. A   HOODED MOVIE ACTOR TYPE (25) sits slumped next him
     texting on   a phone. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha
     are having   brunch at a table nearby.

                            MIRANDA
                  Yes, it's sad, but I'm not going to
                  make it any sadder by staying at a
                  bad hotel while I look for a place.
                  Pass the salt.

     Charlotte passes the salt.

                            MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                  Plus, I have to be downtown and
                  close to Brooklyn. We're going to
                  keep things as normal for Brady as
                  we can. I'll pick him up on my
                  days... take him over on Steve's.

                                                   46.


                         CARRIE
               I don't know if this question is
               allowed -- but how is Steve
               handling this?

                          MIRANDA
               Says he's devastated -- begs me to
               forgive him.
                   (beat)
               Not going to happen. I can barely
               even look at him.

                         CHARLOTTE
               Steve -- I can't believe it.

                         CARRIE
               That's what I said.

                         SAMANTHA
               Miranda, honey -- are you sure you
               want to do this? It's just one
               time. Anyone can have a slip.

                         MIRANDA
               Well, even if I could get my head
               around that justification -- it's
               the cheating part -- the behind my
               back part... the violation of the
               trust -- that's the thing that's
               killing me.

     Samantha nods, taking it in.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               Besides... women who stay with men
               who cheat are women who are afraid
               to be on their own. And that's not
               me -- I can handle it. Always
               could.

     Brady walks over holding an action figure.

                         BRADY
               Mommy, I want to go home.

     Miranda nods; keeping a brave face. Charlotte looks upset.


61   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER 61

     Charlotte and Harry are making love, gently. She looks into
     his eyes -- speaks softly.

                                                    46A.


                           CHARLOTTE
                 Thank-you for being you.

       He smiles, touched. She smiles -- he kisses her.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 Charlotte made love to Harry five
                 times that week.


61aA   INT. SAMANTHA'S BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT -- FALL             61aA

       Smith and Samantha are sitting at the dining table. ANAKA,
       (45) a Zen, low-key chef lays down plates in front of them.

                           SAMANTHA
                 It's a little quick to move out,
                 don't you think?

                           SMITH
                 Her reaction is her reaction.
                 Thanks Anaka.

       Anaka nods and walks away.

                           SAMANTHA
                 He had sex once. Not even an
                 affair.

                           SMITH
                 Maybe it's not the sex. Maybe,
                 it's the cheating. For me... that
                 would be the thing. That it
                 happened behind my back.

                           SAMANTHA
                 That's what she said.

       He nods. Samantha eats. Thinks.

                           SMITH
                 Look. I know we're not married but -
                 - if you were going to have sex
                 with someone else...

       Long pause. He looks at her.

                           SAMANTHA
                 Are you waiting for me to get out
                 my datebook?

                                                   46B.


                          SMITH
                    (beat; then)
                But... seriously, I'd rather know
                first.

      She gets up from the table and moves over to him.

                          SAMANTHA
                You want me to tell you if I'm
                going to have sex? Fine. I'm about
                to have sex.

      She sits on the table directly in front of him and opens her
      legs. Anaka enters -- sees her position, spins on his heels
      and walks back out.

                          SMITH
                    (as he goes)
                Thanks Anaka.


61A   INT. REST HOME -- DAY -- SUMMER                           61A

      Mary sits in a chair eating dinner from a tray. Miranda sits
      on the edge of the bed near her.

                          MIRANDA
                I don't know if Steve's mentioned
                anything to you yet -- about us.
                Has he?

      Mary shakes her head: No -- concerned. Miranda nods.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                Well -- we've had some marriage
                problems -- it's not necessary to
                go into the details but -- I just
                wanted you to know that we won't be
                coming to see you together anymore.
                I'll be here Monday, Wednesday and
                Sunday -- the other days will be
                Steve.

                          MARY
                Who's Steve?

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Miranda was starting to see the
                upside of Alzheimer's.

                                                  46C.


62   INT. BIG'S SUBLET/DEN -- NIGHT -- LATE SUMMER              62

     The room is crowded with Carrie's boxes waiting to be moved.
     Big is sitting at a computer reading his emails.

                                              47.


Close on screen: We see his email address is John@JJPny.com.
He clicks open a file as Carrie enters.

                    CARRIE
          Wedding crunch time. We need to
          really get serious here.

                     BIG
          Not now -- I just got an email from
          the the contractor -- they pushed
          our move-in date again -- and I
          have to --

                    CARRIE
          Nope. Wedding before contractor.
          Unless you're planning to invite
          him -- which would make the guest
          list two hundred and one.

                    BIG
          Two hundred? Jesus, Carrie -- it's
          gone up again?

                    CARRIE
          Blame the New York Post and Vogue.
          Two publications that have never
          before been uttered in the same
          sentence.

                    BIG
          You said: seventy-five people in a
          partitioned-off room.

                    CARRIE
          It's the dress. How can I explain
          this? It's like poker -- The dress
          upped the ante.

                    BIG
          Change the dress.

                    CARRIE
          No, no, no -- you haven't seen this
          dress. This dress may be the whole
          reason to get married. Well, you
          and the dress.

She sits in his lap. He adjusts, uncomfortable.

                    CARRIE(CONT'D)
          How are you coming with your vows?
          Just a reminder -- you are going to
          be saying these in front of a lot
          of people, so the pressure is on.

                                                   48.


                         BIG
                   (He's had it)
               Up, up. I have to finish this. Up.

     He sort of "helps her" out of his lap.

                         CARRIE
               Hey...

                         BIG
               I don't have time for this.

                         CARRIE
               This is our wedding and you're not
               taking it seriously.

                         BIG
               No, I'm not -- It's a circus! Two
               hundred people -- Page Six -- This
               is my third marriage -- how do you
               think it makes me look?

     Carrie looks at him, stunned by this new information.

                          CARRIE
               I didn't know that was even an
               issue.
                   (beat)
               Why didn't you say anything sooner?

                         BIG
               You wanted all this.

                         CARRIE
               But -- don't you want --

                         BIG
               I want you, Carrie. That's what I
               want. I would have just gone down
               to city hall.

     Tension. He starts out of the room, moving a wardrobe box out
     of his way as he goes. She stands there. Upset.


63   INT. BIG'S SUBLET/BATHROOM -- LATER                        63

     Big is brushing his teeth. There's a knock. The door opens.
     Carrie comes in, vulnerable.

                         CARRIE
               I think it's too late for city hall
               now.

                                                     49.


                          BIG
                Well, no. I wasn't suggesting -- I
                was just saying.

      He looks at her. She looks -- devastated.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                See. That is the face I've been
                trying to avoid. Come here.

      She stands there. He goes to her, hugs her.

                          CARRIE
                You're a great man friend.

      She buries her head in his chest; relieved. He exhales.


64    INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- NIGHT -- FALL                   64

      Miranda, Charlotte, Harry, Samantha, Smith, Stanford,
      Anthony, Bitsy and other GUESTS are gathered around a long
      beautifully-set table. Carrie and Big ARRIVE at the top of
      the stairs. Everyone looks up and applauds.


64A   INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAUANT -- LATER                           64A

      The desserts are being served. Samantha stands and prepares
      to speak. Harry hits a glass with a spoon... people quiet
      down.

                          SAMANTHA
                Now, I know it's tradition at the
                rehearsal dinner for the maid of
                honor to reveal embarrassing things
                about the bride. But in our group --

      She looks at Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                ... We never kiss and tell.

      Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte WHOOP. Laughter.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                So, I'd like to make a toast to the
                groom.

      From somewhere down the table, KARL (50) a Preppy Businessman
      CALLS OUT; joking.

                          KARL
                There's a word he's heard before!

                                                   50.


     The room LAUGHS. Big smiles; tight. Carrie leans in.

                         CARRIE
               Who is that again?

                         BIG
               Karl... a partner at the firm.

                         CARRIE
               Karl's kind of a jerk.

                         KARL
                   (Calling)
               You know what they say -- three
               times a charm!

                         SAMANTHA
                   (Calling to Karl)
               Hey "dick wad"... I'm speaking.

                            CARRIE
               Whooo!

                         SAMANTHA
               Now. There were times when we had
               our doubt about this gorgeous man.
               But after careful observation over
               the last hundred years, my doubts
               are over.
                   (Lifts glass high)
               So... here's to the groom. A man
               who finally got "Carrie-d" away.

     Big is touched. Then Karl feels the need to add:

                         KARL
               Here's hopin', John!

     Big smiles, he has no choice. He raises his glass.

                            CARRIE
                   (Soft)
               Jackass.


65   EXT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- LATER                           65

     Samantha is out front with Big, Harry and Smith. They are
     smoking cigars.

                         BIG
               Quite a toast, Samantha.

                                                   51.


                         SAMANTHA
               Well, you're quite a guy.

     They chuckle, then -- Samantha's smile fades.

                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
               Steve.

     The men turn as Steve approaches. He has a look of real pain
     and guilt and embarrassment on his face.

                         STEVE
               I don't want to bother you all --

                         BIG
               You're not bothering us.

                         STEVE
               But --- I need to talk to Miranda.
               Samantha, could you -- ask her to
               come out. I don't want to go in.
               It's a party and all.

     Samantha is trapped... trapped and touched.


66   INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAUANT -- MOMENTS LATER                    66

     Miranda comes out of the ladies room. Samantha spots her.

                         MIRANDA
               Hi. I haven't talked to you all
               night.

                         SAMANTHA
               Steve's here.

     The blood drains from Miranda's face. Samantha nods.


67   EXT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- MOMENTS LATER                   67

     Steve is standing with Smith, Big and Harry as Miranda comes
     out of the restaurant -- Samantha looks out from inside.

                         MIRANDA
               Could you give us --

     The guys go inside. Samantha gives Miranda a look and leads
     them away. Miranda turns. She glares at Steve.

                                                   52.


                         STEVE
               You didn't leave me any choice. You
               won't return my calls -- You only
               talk to me in front of the baby
               when you know I can't say anything.

                         MIRANDA
               What could you possibly have to say
               that could make it better?

                         STEVE
               Miranda, please... It was just that
               one time. Please -- I love you --

                         MIRANDA
               You broke us! You broke us. What we
               had is broken!

     Three YOUNG SINGLE GIRLS (25) walk past them into the club.
     They look back at the scene. Miranda looks down at the
     ground. Steve is paralyzed. Miranda turns to leave -- looks
     back at him with daggers and hurt.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               I changed who I was for you.

     Miranda goes inside. Steve is a stone.


68   INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- LATER                           68

     Miranda makes her way through the crowded bar. She looks very
     rattled. Big spots her and follows, gently.

                         BIG
               Hey. Are you alright?

                         MIRANDA
               No, I'm not alright. You two are
               crazy to get married. Marriage
               ruins everything.

     Miranda walks away, upset. He stands there; shaken.


69   INT. BUDDAKAN RESTAURANT -- LATER                           69

     Big is at the bar having a scotch. Carrie hurries over to
     him. She leans in and puts her arm on his back.

                         CARRIE
               There you are. I thought you
               skipped out on me.

                                                     53.


     She smiles, kisses him. He smiles, sips his scotch.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Well, the all-gal sleepover is
               about to commence. You gonna miss
               me?

                         BIG
               Don't go. Spend the night with me.

                         CARRIE
               Oh... One night won't kill you. And
               tomorrow you get to have me for the
               rest of your life.

     He sips his scotch. She looks at him, sees a glimmer of
     something. Something that scares her.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Is everything okay?

     He looks over -- sees her face. Scared.

                         BIG
               I'm just tired -- I guess.

     Carrie reaches up and fixes Big's hair.

                          CARRIE
               Go home and sleep.
                   (beat)
               Now, give me a kiss good night.
               Make it good -- it's the last
               single girl kiss.

     He looks at her as if to say something, then kisses her.


70   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- LATER -- FALL          70

     Carrie sits on the bed surrounded by Charlotte, Samantha, and
     Miranda all wearing matching robes. Laying on the floor near
     the bed -- three open gift boxes and ribbons. Lily sits in
     Carrie's lap playing with Carrie's cell phone -- in her PJ's.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               There we sat... like a scene out of
               Louisa May Alcott's: "Not-so Little
               Women."

                         CHARLOTTE
               I always knew she would marry Big.

                                              54.


                    SAMANTHA/MIRANDA
          You did not!

                    CHARLOTTE
          Yes I did! After every break-up I
          secretly thought: Nope. They belong
          together.

                    SAMANTHA
          You thought that after the second
          break-up?

                    CHARLOTTE
          Yep.

                    MIRANDA
          After the fifteenth?

                    CARRIE
          Ha ha -- hilarious -- we broke up a
          lot.

                    SAMANTHA
          Yes, but... after the break-ups --
          comes the hot make-up sex.

Charlotte pokes Samantha; indicates Lily. Samantha rolls her
eyes. Carrie's cell phone RINGS. Lily wants to answer it.

                    CARRIE
          You want to answer? Go ahead,
          sweetie... Open it up...

Lily opens it and holds it up to her face, silent.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Say something.

                    LILY
          Sex.

They are all shocked; then: LAUGHTER, even Charlotte.

                    CARRIE
          Sweetie, that was your first bootie
          call.

                    SAMANTHA
          Are you sure she's not my child?

Carrie, still laughing, wipes a tear away as she takes the
phone from Lily and answers it.

                                                    55.


                          CARRIE
               Hello?


71   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                     71

     Big is sitting at the desk, a piece of paper on it.

                          BIG
               It's me.

                         CARRIE
               Oh my God -- did you just hear
               Lily?

                         BIG
               Hey -- I need to talk.

     Carrie puts her hand to her ear, blocking the laughter.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               I'm sitting here trying to write
               these vows and...
                   (beat; then)
               Is this something we really want to
               do?

     Carrie gets out of bed; playing it "casual" to the girls.

                         CARRIE
               It's Big. I'm gonna take it in the--

     She points to the study. Charlotte calls to the phone.

                         CHARLOTTE
                   (calling; silly)
               Get some sleep, groomie!

     Carrie goes into the study and closes the door.


72   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/STUDY -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL      72

     Carrie leans against the door, her face now concerned.

                         CARRIE
               What's the matter?

                          BIG
               It's just -- everything is great as
               it is.
                   (beat)
               I don't want to screw it up.

                                              56.


                       CARRIE
          You won't.

                    BIG
          I screwed it up twice before.

Big is silent. Carrie is thinking, thinking, thinking.

                    CARRIE
          Here's the thing. This is me that
          you're marrying tomorrow. Me.
          Nobody else.

                       BIG
          Yeah.

                    CARRIE
          And I'm marrying you. It's me and
          you. And you want to know the good
          news there?

                       BIG
          Yeah.

                    CARRIE
          We've already both done everything
          we can to screw it up.

He smiles. She is very alert -- thinking, thinking.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Is that a smile I'm hearing?

                       BIG
          Yeah.

                     CARRIE
          Now, it sounds to me like you've
          got a bit of writer's block on the
          vow front.

                       BIG
          Yeah.

                    CARRIE
          And I find - you know - as a
          professional writer- it's best to
          just, you know, stop thinking about
          it so much -- and go to bed. And in
          the morning...

                    BIG
          You know what to do?

                                                    57.


                         CARRIE
               Exactly. And if not -- Just write
               this: "I will love you." Simple and
               to-the-point. And I swear I won't
               even try to take credit for it.

     Silence. Deep silence.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               You're going to bed now, right?

                         BIG
               Okay. Good night.

                         CARRIE
               I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. Me and
               you.

     He hangs up. She looks terrified.


73   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- LATER                 73

     Dark. Charlotte and Carrie are sharing the bed. Carrie is
     wide awake. Here eyes focused across the room on her gorgeous
     wedding gown: ready and waiting.


74   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY -- NEXT DAY -- FALL      74

     Miranda is standing in the hall putting on her earrings. The
     bedroom door opens -- Carrie stands there in the wedding
     gown. Carrie and Miranda catch eyes for a brief moment. There
     are no words.

     Lily steps around from behind Carrie. She is wearing a long
     white dress and holding a LITTLE PURSE. She looks adorable.

                         CARRIE
               There you are! Almost lost you
               under all that. Got your purse?

     Charlotte takes Lily's hand as Anthony comes out of the
     dining room and spots Carrie for the first time.

                         ANTHONY
               Now there's a bride! Flowers!


75   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/DINING ROOM -- LATER             75

     A flurry of activity -- attaching the veil on Carrie.
     Stanford stands near Carrie ready to assist if needed.

                                               57A.


Harry stands in the pantry doorway watching -- eating a
toasted bagel. Charlotte takes a bite -- carefully.

                                                    58.


                         CARRIE
               Whose got a mirror?

                         CHARLOTTE
               Behind you.

     Carrie turns to move to the mirror. She is JERKED BACK.

                         CARRIE
               Stanford, you're on my dress.

                         ANTHONY
               Get off the dress!

                         MIRANDA
               Is that a rip?

                         CARRIE/ANTHONY
               Where?!

     Carrie's CELL PHONE RINGS. Anthony reaches over and picks it
     up, distracted by the dress situation.

                         ANTHONY
                   (sharp; into phone)
               What?


76   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                     76

     Intercut with Big... pacing. He doesn't look rested.

                         BIG
               Can you put Carrie on, please?

                         ANTHONY
               Not now... dress emergency.

     Anthony hangs up, tosses her phone onto the dining table.

                         ANTHONY (CONT'D)
               Damage? What's the damage?

                         SAMANTHA
               There's so much fabric I can't see.

                         ANTHONY
               Can't see anything behind this
               friggin' table. Go, go -- everyone
               out into the hall.

     As the girls start out -- Anthony addresses Stanford.

                                             58A.


                    ANTHONY (CONT'D)
          You're a queen -- you should know
          how to step around a gown.

                    STANFORD
          Don't call me a queen.

                    ANTHONY
          Go -- Out in the hall, your
          highness.

Everyone except for Lily moves out into the hall.

                                                     59.


     Carrie's cell RINGS AGAIN. Lily picks it up, opens it and
     holds it up to her face -- She says nothing.


77   INT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                      77

     Big is standing there. He hears only Lily breathing.

                         BIG
               Hello?

     Lily closes the cell phone. Big reacts, puzzled. She opens
     her little purse, drops the phone in and walks out.


78   EXT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- FALL                  78

     Carries and company leave the building, JADED NEW YORKERS
     passing by react with awe at the beautiful sight.

     CHARLOTTE leads Lily over to HARRY who is waiting by the
     Sedan. He makes a fuss over how cute she looks.


79   EXT. BIG'S SUBLET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                      79

     Big's driver RAOUL (55) is waiting out front next to his car,
     smoking. Big leaves his building talking on his phone.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               It's Carrie... leave me a message.

                         BIG
               Why aren't you calling me back? I
               really need to talk to you. Call me
               back as soon as you get this.

     He closes phone. Raoul opens the back door.


80   INT. LIBRARY -- LATER -- FALL                                80

     WEDDING GUESTS arrive. Bitsy comes up to Stanford. A DRIVER
     follows her carrying a LARGE box from TIFFANY.

                         STANFORD
               Looks like someone had breakfast at
               Tiffany.

                         BITSY
               Sweetheart, look at the size...
               it's breakfast, lunch and dinner at
               Tiffany.
                         (MORE)

                                             59A.

                       BITSY (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          Gifts?

Stanford chuckles as he points. She points to the DRIVER and
they walk away. Anthony comes over to Stanford.

                    ANTHONY
          We have a problem.

                    STANFORD
          I know, but for Carrie's sake I've
          decided to ignore your attitude.

                    ANTHONY
          No, a real problem. They're not
          here.

                    STANFORD
          They're probably stuck in traffic.

                    ANTHONY
          Both of them?

                                                    60.


     Stanford gives a look of concern. Anthony nods.


81   EXT. LIBRARY -- LATER -- FALL                               81

     Big's car is parked in front of the library. Raoul is leaning
     against it looking at his watch.


82   INT. BIG'S CAR - CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         82

     Big is on the phone, smoking one of Raoul's cigarettes.

                         CARRIE (V.O.)
               This is Carrie, leave a message.

                         BIG
               I'm out front -- waiting. I can't
               go in without you.

     He takes a drag on the cigarette. Exhales.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Baby, this whole bride and groom
               thing has really thrown me. I need
               to know that it's still us. Just
               like you said. Me and you.

     Raoul KNOCKS on the window. Big looks out. The girls are in
     the process of climbing out of the limo. Big closes the phone
     and looks. Carrie gets out of the limo, her back to him.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Turn around baby, let me see you.

     Just as he's about to see her face -- Charlotte pulls the
     veil over it. Carrie is gone -- all Big can see is a bride.
     He sinks back into his seat and away from the window as the
     girls hurry up the library stairs.


83   INT. LIBRARY/WEDDING AREA -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL          83

     Anthony and Stanford are waiting, as are Harry with Lily and
     Magda with Brady, who is wearing a little tux with shorts and
     knee socks holding a ring pillow.

     A FLURRY OF HIGH HEELS CLICKING on a marble floor is heard as
     Carrie and the girls arrive around a corner. Magda GASPS,
     overjoyed when she sees Carrie in her dress.

                         MIRANDA
               Traffic was the worst --

                                                     61.


     Miranda kneels to hug Brady. Samantha fluffs Carrie.

                         SAMANTHA
               Ready. We're ready.

     Samantha looks over. Anthony has a weird look on his face.

                         STANFORD
               He's not here yet.

                            SAMANTHA
               Who's not?

                            ANTHONY
               The groom.

     Carrie lifts up her veil with ONE arm and looks out from
     under it. She is on super high-alert.

                         CARRIE
               What's happening?

                         SAMANTHA
               Big's not here.

                         CHARLOTTE
               But we're twenty-five minutes late.

                         CARRIE
               Did anyone call him?
                   (beat; nothing)
               Give me a phone. Someone give me a
               phone.

     Samantha hands her the iPhone. Carrie looks at it.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
                   (tight/controlled)
               I don't know how to work this.

     Stanford hands her a phone. As she dials she catches a
     WORRIED LOOK on Charlotte's face. Carrie turns away and holds
     the phone to her ear, waits. Waits. Then --

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
                   (into phone)
               Are you okay?


84   INT. BIG'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         84

     Big is sitting in the car as it MOVES down a side street.

                                           61A.


                  BIG
        I've been calling you for an hour.
        Why haven't you been answering your
        phone?

                                                    62.


                          CARRIE
                   (anxiety escaping)
               I don't know where my phone is!
                   (beat)
               What is going on? Where are you?

                         BIG
                   (beat; then)
               I was out front --but I just left.
               I can't do this.

                         CARRIE
                   (in pain)
               Oh my God --

     Carrie drops the phone from her ear -- She's heard the words.
     The words on some level she was expecting.

                         CARRIE (CONT'D)
               He's not coming. Oh my God.

     The phone slips out of her hand and lands on the floor.
     Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha don't know what to do.

                         SAMANTHA
               What do you mean he's not coming?

                         CARRIE
               Get me out of here.
                   (beat; a plea)
               -- Get me out of here!

                         SAMANTHA
               Go, go. You take her. I'll stay
               here and deal with this --

     She gestures to the wedding area. Miranda and Charlotte take
     Carrie's arms and quickly start moving her away. Horror on
     all of their faces. Brady CALLS after them, his voice ECHOES
     off the marble.

                         BRADY
               Where you going, Mommy?!

     Samantha looks at Stanford and Anthony -- speechless.


85   EXT. LIBRARY -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL                       85

     The LIMO DRIVER slams the limo door. Carrie is seen through
     the window, sitting in back -- stunned. Miranda and Charlotte
     are in the back next to her -- stunned.

                                                   63.


86   INT. BIG'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         86

     Big sits, pale, staring off as the car drives away.

                         BIG
                   (sudden realization)
               What the fuck am I doing? What the
               fuck am I doing?
                   (to Raoul)
               Turn around and go back.

                         RAOUL
               It's a one way street. I have to go
               around the block.

                         BIG
               By the time we go around the block
               she'll be gone. No one's behind us -
               - Turn around!


87   EXT. 41ST STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                       87

     Big's car makes a QUICK three-point turn and starts back up
     the one-way street as Carrie's limo turns onto it.


88   INT. BIG'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                         88

     Raoul sees the limo -- coming.

                         RAOUL
               I think this is them.

                         BIG
               Pull over. Pull over.

     Big's car pulls over, as the limo approaches. Big powers down
     his window -- as the limo passes, he sees Carrie in the
     window --resting her head against the glass, listless.

                         BIG (CONT'D)
               Carrie!

     Carrie looks up, and see's Big. He smiles an apologetically
     smile. Her limo keeps on moving. Big watches it go. Until...


89   EXT. 41ST STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                       89

     The limo SCREECHES to a halt. The back door flies open and
     Carrie almost leaps out. Big sees her, he looks relieved.

                                              64.


She hurries up the street to Big's car holding her bouquet.
Big gets out of his car just as Carrie reaches him.

                    BIG
          I freaked out for a minute -- but --
          I'm ready now --

Carrie HITS him with her bouquet. It's a violent direct hit
on his face. He recoils. She hits him again, hard... a
wounded sound escaping her throat.

                    BIG (CONT'D)
          Carrie!

She hits him again. He ducks back into the car for
protection. She hits the bouquet on the roof of the car --
the flowers start breaking apart and flying everywhere.

                    CARRIE
          I knew you would do this -- I knew
          it!

Miranda reaches Carrie and holds her back by her waist. Big
gets back out of the car and starts over to her.

                    BIG
          I'm sorry -- I just --

With all she has left, she throws the broken bouquet at him.

                    CARRIE
          You left! I am humiliated!

Carrie starts crying. Charlotte has arrived. Carrie turns and
falls into her arms. Miranda and Charlotte lead her away. Big
starts over to follow.

                    BIG
          Carrie, wait --

Charlotte whips her head around and stares him down.

                    CHARLOTTE
          No!

He stops in his tracks. A WAITRESS (20's) at the Brant Park
Cafe nearby "over-pours" water into a CUSTOMER'S glass --
riveted by the scene. Miranda and Charlotte move Carrie back
into the limo. A CAB comes down the street and HONKS at Big
standing in the road; dazed.

                                                  64A.


90   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/STUDY -- LATER -- FALL           90

     Carrie sits in a chair. She is holding a glass and has an
     Hermes blanket wrapped around her.

                                               65.


Miranda sits nearby holding a bottle of vodka. Samantha
paces, working on her iPHONE.

                    CARRIE
          I thought I would still be in
          extreme pain but I'm feeling
          nothing.

Carrie reaches over and holds out her glass.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          I'd like a little more nothing.

Miranda nods and pours some more vodka into it...

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I had gone from Little Women to
          Little Drunk Women.

Charlotte enters and looks over at Carrie, soulfully.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Yes, I'm still jilted.

                    SAMANTHA
          What the hell got into him? He was
          perfectly fine at the dinner.

Miranda sips her vodka -- should she say anything?

                    CARRIE
          I knew it when he called last
          night. I could tell.

                    SAMANTHA
          Why didn't you say anything?

She shrugs and sips.

                     CARRIE
          Didn't want to believe it. Didn't
          even want to say it out loud.
              (beat)
          And now I have nowhere to love --
              (beat; then)
          I meant live. I have nowhere to
          live.

                    CHARLOTTE
          You'll stay here.

                       CARRIE
          Forever.

                                             65A.


She sips. Charlotte looks at her, concerned.

                                              66.


                    CHARLOTTE
          Maybe you should eat something.

She shakes her head. Charlotte looks at the others.

                    CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
          Anyone hungry?

They shake their heads; no.

                    CARRIE
          Well, if you change your minds, I
          know where we can get one hundred
          beef, seventy-five fish and twenty-
          five vegetarian meals.

She sips. Charlotte rubs her back. She sips.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          And my clothes. All my clothes. I
          can never go over there again. How
          am I going to get my clothes?

                    SAMANTHA
          Oh, honey -- I can hire people to
          do all that. Anything you need.

                     CARRIE
          A hit man?
              (beat)
          I have nothing to wear but a
          wedding gown.

                    CHARLOTTE
          You have your honeymoon stuff here.

                    CARRIE
          There's the silver lining. A
          honeymoon to a romantic Mexican
          resort that's pre-paid on my credit
          card because I wanted to surprise
          the man who jilted me.

                    SAMANTHA
          I can get you out of that. Worse
          comes to worse -- I'll say there
          was a death or something.

                    CARRIE
          Wasn't there?

She sips, looking sad.

                                                   66A.


90A   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/LILY'S ROOM -- LATER           90A

      Charlotte leans down and tucks in the sleeping Lily. She
      picks up a "Chinese baby doll" and nestles it under Lily's
      arm, then turns and starts out.

                                                     67.


91   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS             91

     Miranda is standing in the hall as Charlotte enters from
     Lily's room.

                         MIRANDA
               I did something really bad -- I
               think.

     Charlotte looks at her.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               I said something to Big. At the
               rehearsal dinner.

                         CHARLOTTE
               What do you mean?

                         MIRANDA
               It was right after Steve showed up.
               I was upset... Big came up to me --
               and I said something like: You're
               crazy to get married.
                   (off her look)
               It just came out.

     Charlotte nods trying to understand.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               Do you think it was totally the
               reason?

                         CHARLOTTE
                   (cutting her a break)
               No, no, no. Big has been weird
               about marriage for years.

                         MIRANDA
               I keep thinking I should tell
               Carrie.

                         CHARLOTTE
               No, no. This is a really bad time
               to even mention it - no, no, no.
               Find another time. Later.

     Samantha comes down the hall. She is energized.

                         SAMANTHA
               Well, turns out, I couldn't get her
               out of the honeymoon -- but I got
               us in.

                                                   68.


                         MIRANDA
               What?

                         SAMANTHA
               I just booked us three seats on the
               flight. Mexico here we come.

     Charlotte and Miranda react; completely thrown.

                         MIRANDA
               I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.

     Samantha indicates Carrie -- sitting in the den staring off
     to nowhere, deeply sad -- Devastated.


92   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/ROAD -- SUNSET                           92

     A lush tropical road with a view of the sun setting on the
     ocean. A large open air GOLF CART comes around the bend
     holding the girls. Carrie's hair blows in the breeze, her
     sunglasses firmly in place.


93   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOUSE -- A LITTLE LATER                  93

     A gorgeous romantic private house surrounded by tropical
     splendor. The cart arrives in front. The DOORS are open and
     PAULO (38) the BUTLER stands there holding a tray with two
     beautiful tropical drinks. He is surprised when he sees the
     four women, but he covers, effortlessly.

                         PAULO
               Welcome to Mexico.

                         SAMANTHA
               Buenos dias.

     Carrie gets out of the cart and goes into the house --
     followed by Charlotte and Miranda. Samantha arrives and picks
     up a drink off the tray.

                         PAULO
               I'm sorry. I am confused. I am
               waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.

                         SAMANTHA
               Honey, you'll be waiting for a long
               time.

     She sips the drink, then looks at him, "familiar."

                                                   69.


                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
               We'll talk.


94   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MAIN ROOM -- CONTINUOUS          94

     Charlotte and Miranda stand looking at the gorgeous, romantic
     private Mexican bungalow. Samantha enters; looks.

                          SAMANTHA
               This... will kill her.
                   (beat)
               Where is she?

                         CHARLOTTE
               In the powder room.


95   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/POWDER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS        95

     Carrie stands looking in the mirror. She takes off her
     sunglasses. Her eyes are red, red, red. She splashes water on
     her face and looks at herself in the beautiful Mexican
     mirror.


96   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 96

     Paulo leads Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha into the
     romantic bedroom suite. On the bed -- rose petals are
     scattered in the shape of a large heart.

                            MIRANDA
               Oh My God!

     Miranda and Charlotte quickly grab the bed cover and jerk it
     up -- throwing all the rose petals off. Paulo watches.
     Miranda addresses him in a very intense WHISPER.

                         MIRANDA (CONT'D)
               No more honeymoon stuff. This is
               very important. Have I made myself
               clear?


97   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                    97

     Carrie exits the powder room, her sunglasses in her hand. She
     stands in the entry way; alone. She looks out at the main
     room; the beautiful view, the romance. Her eyes start to
     water. A PORTER enters with the bags. Carrie hides her face,
     acknowledging him with a nod.

                                                     70.


98    INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS       98

      Carrie enters and moves directly to the bed, past Charlotte
      where Miranda is sitting talking on her cell.

                          MIRANDA
                Magda -- I'll talk to you tomorrow

      Miranda hangs up as Carrie crawls onto the bed and lays down.
      The pink sunset light floods across her face.

                          SAMANTHA
                Well, it's a gorgeous sunset.

                          CARRIE
                Close the shutters.

      Paulo moves over to the window and starts closing the
      shutters. The sun is slowly shuttered out.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                All of them.

      Carrie closes her eyes. DARKNESS falls across her face.


99    INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING          99

      The room is dark except for the bright sunlight straining to
      get in between the cracks of the closed shutters. Carrie is
      asleep. Miranda sits on the bed. Carrie stirs, half waking...
      Miranda smiles.

                           MIRANDA
                Morning.

                          CARRIE
                Did I dream it?

      Miranda shakes her head, no. Carrie closes her eyes, falls
      back asleep.


100   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- DUSK           100

      Dark. Carrie is still asleep. Charlotte sits on the bed. She
      gently shakes Carrie. Carrie opens her eyes.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Carrie, it's dinner time. You slept
                the whole day.

                                                    71.


                             CARRIE
                So?

      Carrie closes her eyes. Charlotte exhales, concerned.


101   INT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING         101

      A "tingling of glass" sound wakes Carrie. She opens her eyes
      and looks. Samantha is just sitting on the bed with a
      breakfast tray.

                           SAMANTHA
                Honey, you have to eat a little
                breakfast.

                             CARRIE
                I'm tired.

                          SAMANTHA
                Eat something and you can go back
                to sleep.

      Samantha holds up a bowl of yogurt. Carrie adjusts on her
      pillows a little. Samantha feeds Carrie a spoonful of yogurt.
      Carrie looks at her. Samantha nods.


102   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- LATER                    102

      Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are sitting having lunch.
      Charlotte opens a pre-packaged "snack pack" chocolate
      pudding. She peels the lid off, takes a spoon and starts
      eating.

                          SAMANTHA
                With all this gorgeous fresh food
                you're just going to eat that
                pudding crap the entire trip?

                          CHARLOTTE
                It's the only thing in the pantry
                that's totally safe.
                    (holding up lid)
                See. Made in Poughkeepsie. I don't
                want to chance it.

                          MIRANDA
                It's a five-star resort.

                          CHARLOTTE
                It's Mexico.

                                                    72.


      The bedroom door opens. Carrie walks out. The sun hits her
      eyes. She squints.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                Carrie!

                          CARRIE
                Is there coffee?


103   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- LATER                  103

      All four girls are laying in the sun in bathing suits reading
      magazines. Miranda re-adjusts her body, stretching out on her
      beach chair.

                          MIRANDA
                The sun feels nice.

      Samantha looks over at her and notices something.

                          SAMANTHA
                Jesus, honey. Wax much?

      Miranda looks up at Samantha. Samantha indicates her swimsuit
      crotch area...which is badly in need of a wax. Miranda grabs
      her towel and covers her crotch area.

                          MIRANDA
                -- What? I didn't know I was going
                to be in a swimsuit.

      Carrie and Charlotte look up from their magazines.

                          CHARLOTTE
                What are you talking about?

                          MIRANDA
                I forgot to get a wax.

                          SAMANTHA
                Since when -- 1998?

      Carrie looks away, resumes reading.

                          MIRANDA
                I've had other things on my mind.

                          SAMANTHA
                I could be on death row and not
                have that situation.

                                              73.


                    MIRANDA
          Well, when you're married, Samantha
          -- you have a different set of
          priorities.

                     SAMANTHA
          Honey don't blame marriage --
              (re: Charlotte)
          This one's married -- and she's not
          growing a national forest. How do
          you even cross your legs?
              (beat)
          Let me make you a spa appointment --
          Any thicker and you won't be able
          to find it.

Miranda gets up from the chair and looks at her, mad.

                    MIRANDA
          So what -- It's my fault?! I let
          the sex go out of our marriage! I
          deserve what I got. Thanks for
          understanding.

She walks away. Samantha calls after her.

                    SAMANTHA
          Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what --

                      MIRANDA
          I'm fine!

Miranda goes inside. Carries throws her magazine down.

                    CARRIE
          Let's go down to the hotel for
          dinner on the beach tonight.

                      CHARLOTTE
          Really?

                    CARRIE
          Yeah. I've got to do something to
          pull me out of my Mexicoma.

                    SAMANTHA
          Oh, honey... you made a little
          joke. Good for you.

Samantha nods. Charlotte smiles; encouraged.

                                                    74.


104   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER             104

      A romantic open-air restaurant on the beach. A MARIACHI BAND
      is serenading HONEYMOON COUPLES. A MALE HOST leads the girls
      across the small dance floor to their table. As they walk
      Miranda notices a slow dancing TWENTY-SOMETHING HONEYMOON
      COUPLE kissing -- very much in love.

                          MIRANDA
                    (to Carrie)
                Don't look to your --

                            CARRIE
                Too late.

      They arrive at their table and the host places down MENUS.
      FELIX, (40) the waiter comes up to them.

                          MAITRE' D
                Buenos notches. My name is Felix,
                I`ll be your server.

                          SAMANTHA
                    (to Felix)
                Felix -- We'll start with quatro
                margaritas.

                          CHARLOTTE
                No, I'm not drinking. Just bottled
                water.

                          CARRIE
                    (to waiter)
                I'll drink hers.

                          FELIX
                May I have your room numbers?

                          CARRIE
                We're staying in one of the private
                houses. Number three.

      He looks down onto a list he is holding, then up to Carrie.

                          MAITRE' D
                Very good, Mrs. Preston.

      The waiter smiles and walks away.

                          CARRIE
                That was like taking a bullet.

                                                    74A.


       Miranda, Samantha, and Carrie look at the menu. Charlotte
       reaches into her purse and pulls out a little pudding and
       places it on the table. They all look at her.

                           MIRANDA
                 Charlotte had pudding in her Prada.

       Samantha laughs. Miranda smiles. Carrie looks.

                           CARRIE
                 Will I ever laugh again?
                     (beat; then)
                 I'm serious.

                           MIRANDA
                 Yes.

                           CARRIE
                 When?

                           MIRANDA
                 When something is really, really
                 funny.

       The Mariachi band strolls by playing.

                           CARRIE
                 Thank god for that Mariachi band or
                 I'd be able to hear my own
                 thoughts.

       Felix re-enters with the drinks.

                           SAMANTHA
                 Fabulous -- and keep them coming.


104A   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER            104A

       Food is on the table -- but Carrie, Miranda and Samantha are
       mostly drinking. Charlotte is eating her pudding.

                            CARRIE
                 After everything I know... After
                 twenty years of everything we've
                 learned -- I threw it all away for
                 the thrill of putting his name on
                 the honeymoon suite.
                     (beat)
                 If I met me now -- I wouldn't know
                 me.

                                             74B.


                     SAMANTHA
          Well, as long as we're going down
          this road.

They look at her -- she sips her cocktail.

                    SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          I can't believe my life revolves
          around a man. On what planet did I
          allow that to happen?

                    CHARLOTTE
          You love him.

                    SAMANTHA
          Does that mean saying his name
          fifty times more a day than I say
          my own? Does it mean worrying about
          him and his needs before me and
          mine? Is it all about the other
          person? Is that love?

                    MIRANDA
          No, that's marriage.

                    CARRIE
          So, you're saying marriage is a bad
          thing? Good to know right about
          now.

Samantha looks down at her gardenia ring.

                    SAMANTHA
          Even this ring. I wanted to buy
          this for myself. That meant
          something to me. To be able to do
          that. Then, he buys it for me.

                    CHARLOTTE
          Because he knew how much you loved
          it.

                    SAMANTHA
          Yes. But now, every time I look
          down at it... I see him. Not me.

                    CHARLOTTE
          You could look at it and see a man
          who loves you and wants you to be
          happy.

                    SAMANTHA
          No, you could look at it and see
          that. I'm Samantha.

                                                    74C.


       The Waiter walks over --

                           SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                 We'll take another round.

                            CHARLOTTE
                 Another?

                           SAMANTHA
                 Relax -- we're on vacation.

                            CARRIE
                 Technically -- we're on my
                 honeymoon.

                            MIRANDA
                 No-- I think we're on their
                 honeymoon.

       She points to the TWENTY-SOMETHING COUPLE at a nearby table--
       who have progressed to graphic French kissing.

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                     (call to them)
                 It's all so hot -- three days in.


104B   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER            104B

       The GIRLS are pretty much the only ones left in the
       restaurant. Empty drink glasses.

                           CARRIE
                 He couldn't get out of the car.
                 After everything he'd already put
                 me through -- he couldn't make the
                 effort and get out of the car? I
                 made the effort -- I put a bird on
                 my head.

                           MIRANDA
                 Was that what that was?

                            CARRIE
                 Yes.

                           MIRANDA
                 I thought it was just feathers.

                           CARRIE
                 No. It was a bird.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 It was beautiful.

                                             74D.


                    CARRIE
          He's a bad guy. Always was. Bad
          guys do bad things.

                    MIRANDA
          And good guys do bad things. The
          good guys screw you and the bad
          guys screw you.

                    SAMANTHA
          And the rest of them don't know how
          to screw you. Trust me-- I've done
          the leg work.

                    MIRANDA
          And that was all Steve had --
          didn't have money -- didn't have a
          career. He was the good guy
          bartender with a big dick.

The all look over at her and react.

                       SAMANTHA
          How big?

                    CHARLOTTE
          I don't want to know this.

                    SAMANTHA
          Eat your pudding.

                    MIRANDA
          Nine. Like -- nine and change.

                    CARRIE
          That's nice. Kinda balances off the
          one ball.

                    SAMANTHA
          You can't forgive a man with a dick
          over nine inches?
              (off Miranda's "no")
          Well, honey, if you can't -- some
          other woman will.

Felix comes up to the table.

                    FELIX
          Ladies -- the bar is closing.

                       CHARLOTTE
          Thank God.

                                                    74E.


                           CARRIE
                     (to Felix)
                 Mrs. Preston will take the check.

                           SAMANTHA
                 And a bottle of tequila.

       Charlotte's eyes widen. Felix nods.


104C   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER            104C

       The STAFF are stacking chairs -- The Mariachi band plays.
       Carrie, Miranda and Samantha are on the beach wading into the
       water. Charlotte is just off the dance floor -- holding their
       shoes.

                           CHARLOTTE
                     (calling)
                 Don't go all the way in -- there
                 may be sharks!

                                                 75-76.


106   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- DAY                    106

      Carrie, Miranda and Samantha are laying in the shade. Miranda
      is working on her laptop. Carrie is cautiously studying her
      cell phone. She reads the message "window".

                          CARRIE
                "Mail box full."

                          SAMANTHA
                No time like the present.

                          CARRIE
                Not ready to face it all yet.

      Carrie puts down the phone. Charlotte walks out of the house
      wearing a workout outfit.

                                                      77.


                          CHARLOTTE
                I'm going for a run and then to the
                gym for pilates. Anyone want to --

      They all shake their heads: no. Charlotte trots away.

                          MIRANDA
                Good news. Just got an e mail from
                your buyer's attorney -- they have
                agreed to sell you back your old
                apartment at that escalated price.
                    (reading)
                And "are willing to vacate by the
                time you return -- pending an
                additional financial offer."

                          CARRIE
                Well, apparently you can go home
                again -- but it'll cost you.

                          SAMANTHA
                Now -- lets work on getting your
                things there.

      Samantha picks up her iPhone and starts working as Miranda
      types an e mail response. Carrie watches them; touched.

                          CARRIE
                You two could rule the world.


107   INT. RESORT/GYM CHANGING ROOM-- CONTINUOUS                  107

      Charlotte is showering after her workout.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                After her workout Charlotte
                couldn't help but think about how
                truly blessed she was. This week
                had made her feel more grateful
                than ever for her happy marriage.

      Charlotte closes her eyes, lets the water flow over her.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And while picturing her loved ones
                at home in New York, she forgot
                where she was...

      Charlotte opens her mouth, shower water goes in.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And opened her mouth.

                                                     78.


      Charlotte suddenly realizes what she's done. She spits the
      water out. A panicked look on her face.


108   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/PATH -- LATER                            108

      Charlotte walks along, looking refreshed. There's a GURGLING
      sound in her stomach. Her eyes WIDEN. She walks quickly.


109   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT/PATH -- MOMENTS LATER                    109

      Charlotte is moving oddly. Walking on the balls of her feet.
      She passes a WORKER who is pruning the bushes.

                          WORKER
                Hello Miss.

      Charlotte shakes her head; not now. He looks at her.


110   EXT. MEXICAN RESORT HOUSE/PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER             110

      Carrie and Samantha sit reading. Charlotte hurries across the
      patio -- a CRAZED LOOK on her face.

                          CARRIE
                Sweetie -- what's --

      She shakes her head: NO and moves quickly to a door.   She
      tries the handle -- it's LOCKED. NO!

                          SAMANTHA
                That's locked -- Use the other--

      Charlotte starts - but stops, cold. She has the look of a
      trapped animal on her face. Then - BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM.
      Charlotte's eyes WIDEN. They watch -- stunned.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And just like that, Charlotte
                Pookeepsed in her pants.

      Miranda opens the door and stands there.    Takes in the scene.

                           MIRANDA
                Did you   --

                          CHARLOTTE
                Shut up, shut up, shut up.

                                                    79.


      Charlotte duck waddles across the patio to the open door.
      Carrie, Samantha and Miranda look at each other. Carrie
      BURSTS out laughing. She laughs till her eyes water.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Miranda was right -- when something
                was really, really funny -- I
                laughed.


111   EXT. MEXICAN CLIFFS -- LATER                                111

      Carrie sits overlooking a magnificent view of the ocean. She
      has her cell phone in her hand. She pushes a button and
      listens to the first message.

                          VOICEMAIL (V.O.)
                First message. Received: Saturday,
                September twentieth; twelve-thirty
                P.M.

                          BIG (V.O.)
                Hey babe -- I need to talk to you
                before you leave for the -- .

      Carrie impulsively THROWS her phone off the cliff. It sails
      through the air. The sun glistens off the pink crystals as it
      falls to the ocean below.


112   EXT. CARRIE'S BUILDING -- DAY -- FALL                       112

      Raining. A MANHATTAN STORAGE TRUCK drives away from the front
      of Carrie's building revealing... Carrie - standing in her
      front doorway. She exhales, turns and walks back inside.


113   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER                    113

      CARRIE swings open the front door -- her living room is
      filled with boxes of her clothes, a few of her furniture
      pieces -- many, beautifully wrapped wedding gifts -- and her
      wedding gown.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                There was no better time I could
                think of to hire and assistant.


114   INT. STARBUCKS -- DAY -- FALL                               114

      Carrie sits across from A SPOILED LABEL QUEEN (22) wearing
      expensive clothes.

                                                    80.


                          SPOILED LABEL QUEEN
                Ummm, no. I don't lift boxes. Yeah,
                definitely - No.


115   INT. STARBUCKS -- LATER -- FALL                             115

      A LARGE PARTY GIRL (34) Low cut blouse; very relaxed.

                           PARTY GIRL
                I love your books. You're shit's
                brilliant.

                          CARRIE
                Um, Cathy... You seem drunk.

                           PARTY GIRL
                Little bit. Never got to bed last
                night.
                    (beat)
                But I type like a motherfucker.


116   INT. STARBUCKS -- LATER -- FALL                             116

      A mousey BUSINESS GUY (23) in a tweed suit and tie.

                          BUSINESS GUY
                I have a degree in finance from
                Princeton and for the last two
                years I have been assistant to a
                V.P. at Merrill Lynch.

                          CARRIE
                    (polite/lost)
                And why do you think you're right
                for this job?

      He glances at his feet. Carrie looks down. He is wearing high
      heels.


117   INT. STARBUCKS -- LATER -- FALL                             117

      Louise (22) African-American -- she holds a LOUIS VUITTON
      DENIM PURSE.

                          CARRIE
                So, you're from St. Louis?

                          LOUISE
                That's right. Louise from St.
                Louis.

                                              81.


Carrie smiles, looks down at her resume.

                     CARRIE
          Have you ever been a personal
          assistant?

                    LOUISE
          No, but I'm the oldest of six kids,
          so I can pretty much handle
          anything you got.

                    CARRIE
          Six kids? What was that like?

                    LOUISE
          Crowded. I had to move to New York
          just to get some room. And where'd
          I wind up? A one bedroom apartment
          with three roommates.

                    CARRIE
              (laughs; then)
          Aside from the space issue... why'd
          you move to New York?

                    LOUISE
          To fall in love.

Carrie is taken aback.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          What? That's corny, right?

                    CARRIE
          No, it's just -- so -- honest. I
          don't think I've ever heard anyone
          say that in a long time.

Louise looks at her, owns it. Carrie smiles, sold.

                     CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Well... Louise from St. Louis... I
          have just one more question.
              (beat)
          How does an unemployed girl with
          three roommates afford the
          Patchwork Denim Bowley Louis
          Vuitton bag?

                    LOUISE
          It's rented. "Bag, Borrow or
          Steal." It's like Netflix for
          purses.

                                                     82.


                          CARRIE
                No! How can I not know about this?

                          LOUISE
                Girl, stick with me, I'll hook you
                up.


118   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT-- DAY -- FALL                       118

      The room is now half-empty of the presents. Louise sits in
      the middle of the clutter -- busy writing out note cards.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And she did hook me up.


119   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- FALL                      119

      The space is much more orderly. Louise is kneeling on the
      floor taking books out of boxes and placing them on in piles
      on the floor. Carrie enters -- amazed at the progress. Her
      phone rings. Louise answers it instantly.

                          LOUISE
                Carrie Bradshaw... This is Louise.
                    (listens; then repeats)
                Anne From the New York Observer...

      She looks over at Carrie, who shakes her head: No.

                          LOUISE (CONT'D)
                I'll let her know you called.

      She hangs up and continues working. Carrie watches her.


120   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- FALL                      120

      Louise directs two DELIVERY MEN who are carrying a NEW
      MATTRESS into the bedroom. Carrie watches from her closet
      surrounded by boxes.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                After only three days -- I began to
                think of her as Saint Louise from
                St. Louis.


121   INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY                                121

      Miranda is sitting at her desk, eating a take-out salad while
      talking on the phone.

                                             82A.


                    MIRANDA
              (into phone)
          No, I can't be more patient. Your
          agency has had three weeks to find
          me an apartment.

The office door opens -- A TWENTY-SOMETHING ASSISTANT enters
and places some documents on the desk in front of her.
Miranda signs as she chews and talks.

                    MIRANDA (CONT'D)
          No -- I told you... It has to be in
          Manhattan. Because it does.
                    (MORE)

                                                     83.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                How hard could it be to find
                something just on the other side of
                the Brooklyn Bridge?

      The assistant takes the documents and starts away.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone pissed)
                On second thought -- Forget it. I
                could do a better job myself.

      Miranda hangs up, exhales. Bites her salad. Determined.


122   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE -- LATER                              122

      An ethically diverse neighborhood with ethnically diverse
      PEOPLE. Miranda walks with Brady. A WIDE EYED Magda walks
      next to her.

                          MIRANDA
                According to New York Magazine,
                this is the new up-and-coming
                neighborhood.

      A CAUCASIAN YUPPIE DAD (32) with a BABY in a snugly comes out
      of bodega. Miranda turns to Magda.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                See! Wherever he's going is where
                we need to be.

      Miranda, excited about the hunt --picks up the pace following
      after the dad. Magda hurries as best as she can.


123   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE STREET -- LATER                       123

      Miranda, Brady and Magda walk around a corner.

                          MAGDA
                I've been here before -- This was
                all Ukrainian area.

      Miranda spots a U-HAUL truck parked in front of a building.

                          MIRANDA
                Coming or going?

                                                      84.


      TWO NYU-TYPE KIDS come out of a building carrying boxes.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                Going. Oh boy. Lets go.

      She starts down the street with a clip.


124   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE -- LATER                               124

      Magda is standing out in front of the apartment building with
      Brady. She looks -- A HOT LOOKING LATIN GUY (29) with tattoos
      is sitting on the stoop with a pitbull.


125   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER             125

      Miranda peeks into the empty apartment. Nice size, brick
      wall, big windows with a view of a colorful jungle gym on a
      play ground across the street. Her heart starts racing.


126   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER             126

      Miranda comes out of the building out of breath as the NYU
      kids are going back in.

                           MIRANDA
                Hi. I'm interested in the
                apartment.

                          NYU KID
                Get in line.

                          MIRANDA
                I understand but -- who would I
                talk to about it?

                             NYU KID
                The super.

      He points to a SIGN in LOBBY. The name: Lovro Klujcik and a
      telephone number. Miranda writes it down.

                          MIRANDA
                Lovro... -- and I have no idea.
                    (attempting to pronounce)
                Ku...

                          MAGDA
                    (amazed)
                Kljuic. Lovro Klujcik. I know him.

                                                     85.


                            MIRANDA
                No way.

                          MAGDA
                We were couple -- long time ago.

                          MIRANDA
                    (can't believe her luck)
                No way -- You dated?

                          MAGDA
                Haven't seen him since his wife
                died.

                          MIRANDA
                He's single?

      Magda shrugs as if to say: So what? Miranda smiles.


127   INT. SPANISH HAIR SALON -- LATER -- FALL                   127

      Spanish music plays. Two female HAIRDRESSERS work on two
      Dominican WOMEN CUSTOMERS. Magda sits under a hair dryer --
      her top lip white with cream bleach. Miranda is next to her,
      dialing on her cell. Brady plays nearby with two Dominican
      KIDS (5,6).


128   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER -- FALL                   128

      Miranda stands at a gate and pushes the buzzer marked
      "Klujcik." A door under the stoop opens revealing LOVRO
      KLUJCIK, a Croatian man about Magda's age.

                          LOVRO
                No, no... I told you on phone...
                the apartment is --

      He looks past Miranda and sees Magda -- standing there with
      brown hair and wearing make-up. His face lights up when he
      sees her.

                            LOVRO (CONT'D)
                Magda?    Is this you?

      She smiles. Shy. He beams at her. He opens the gate, saying
      something to her in his native tongue. Magda smiles.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                As much as Miranda wanted to pat
                herself on the back for finding her
                new apartment in just one
                afternoon... in the end, she knew --

                                                   85A.


      Miranda watches, thrilled as they converse.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                It was a Lovro connection.


129   INT. BEACHOUSE/BEDROOM -- NIGHT                           129

      SAMANTHA and SMITH have just finished making love. They are
      face to face.

                          SAMANTHA
                That was really hot.

                          SMITH
                Hmmm. You were kind of distant.

                                              86.


                    SAMANTHA
          Distant? You're still in me.

He gently moves off her and reclines next to her.

                    SMITH
          You want to talk about it?

                    SAMANTHA
          When have I ever wanted to talk
          about it?

                    SMITH
          Okay. I'll talk about it. Your best
          friends get screwed over by their
          guys -- how can you not get
          distant?

                    SAMANTHA
          It's more than that -- lately, I
          haven't been feeling a connection
          to --

                      SMITH
          What? Me?

                    SAMANTHA
          No -- to -- it -- here. I have no
          real connection to our life here.

                    SMITH
          What life here? Seriously -- all I
          do is work -- and you run off to
          New York every chance you get.

                    SAMANTHA
          Not every chance I get. Only for
          the A-list things.
              (beat; then)
          And my managing you -- it's all too
          much. I'm starting to resent it.
          For the last two years it's been
          all about you.

                    SMITH
          Well, for the first three years it
          was all about you.

                    SAMANTHA
          I know. That was so much more fun.

                                                   86A.


                          SMITH
                Maybe we need to make an effort to
                reconnect -- spend more time
                together -- away from the business.
                Less me, less you -- More us.


130   INT. BEACHOUSE -- DAY -- FALL                             130

      Samantha is on the phone, looking out at the ocean.

                                                    87.


                          SAMANTHA
                So, I won't be coming to New York
                for a while. We're going to spend
                some time reconnecting on the
                weekends... do the "LA couple
                thing."


131   EXT. NYC STREETS -- CONTINUOUS   -- FALL                  131

      Intercut with Carrie at a public pay phone.

                          CARRIE
                Yeah, hi, can you put on Samantha?

                          SAMANTHA
                Really. At first I was all: "You
                can't tell me what I can do" -- but
                then, I had to admit he had a
                point.

                          CARRIE
                You people and your relationships.

                          OPERATOR (V.O.)
                Please deposit another eighty-five
                cents.

                          SAMANTHA
                Honey, a pay phone? Where's your
                cell?

                          CARRIE
                At the bottom of the ocean in
                Mexico.

                          SAMANTHA
                Want me to hook you up with a new
                one?

                          CARRIE
                No, not yet. No phone -- no calls,
                no calls-- no questions, no
                questions-- no explaining no
                wedding.

      Carrie puts coins into phone. She is wearing gloves.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Plus, It's an excuse to break out
                the gloves.

                                                    88.


132   EXT. BEACH -- DAY -- FALL                                   132

      Samantha and Smith run into the surf in their wetsuits with
      surfboards.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                When Samantha Jones decides to do
                something...

      Samantha and Smith are starting to make love on the beach as

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                ... She does it all the way.

      A BEACHCOMBER with a metal detector, watches nearby.

                She and Smith did all the upscale
                L.A. couple things. Sushi...

                ... Spray tanning.


136   EXT. HOLLYWOOD BENEFIT -- NIGHT -- FALL                     136

137   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- FALL                    137

      Carrie sips a latté while sorting through a stack of papers.
      Louise is working on Carrie's computer.

                          LOUISE
                Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a
                mess.

                          CARRIE
                -- Interesting -- so is Carrie
                Bradshaw.

      Louise laughs. Carrie sips her latte.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Come on -- When are we going to get
                to the really important things like
                unpacking my closet?

                          LOUISE
                One thing at a time. Are you ever
                going to answer these emails?

                            CARRIE
                Yes.

                            LOUISE
                When?

                            CARRIE
                Now?

                          LOUISE
                Okay -- I'll read -- you tell me
                what to do.(beat) Vitaminsforless.
                Delete. Right?

                            CARRIE
                So right.

      Louise deletes it -- Looks at next e mail.

                          LOUISE
                Who's John@jjpny.com.?

      Carries freezes -- Louise looks up.

                          LOUISE (CONT'D)
                Oh, shit -- that's him, right?

      Carrie turns the lap-top around to face her and looks.

                                                    90.


      JOHN@JJPNY.COM: "I'M SORRY."

      She clicks the email open; breathless. One sentence:

      "I don't know what to say."

      She swings the laptop back around to Louise.

                          CARRIE
                Delete.

      Louise looks at her, unsure... then deletes.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And -- isn't there some cyberspace
                place that you can send those so
                that I never have to see an email
                from him ever again?
                    (off her nod)
                Do that please.

                          LOUISE
                You sure you want to end all
                communication with him?

      Carrie nods. Louise nods.


138   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/LILY'S ROOM -- DAY -- FALL       138

      Carrie is reading Cinderella to Lily who sits in her lap.
      They are on Lily's bed - surrounded by her dolls.

                          CARRIE
                    (reading)
                "And Cinderella and Prince Charming
                lived happily ever after."
                    (beat; looks at her)
                This is a fairy tall sweetheart.
                Things don't always happen like
                this in real life -- you should
                know that now.

                          LILY
                Again!

      Carrie flips back to the front. Lily is all smiles.

                          CARRIE
                And another one bites the dust.

      Charlotte walks into the den with her coat on. She smiles.

                                                    91.


                          LILY
                Mommie home!


139   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALL -- A LITTLE LATER         139

      Charlotte walks Carrie to the front door.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Thanks for watching her while I
                went to the doctor.

                          CARRIE
                    (pulling on coat)
                Sure. Everything okay?

                          CHARLOTTE
                I'm pregnant.

      Carrie looks at her. Charlotte smiles.

                           CARRIE
                How?

                          CHARLOTTE
                My doctor said sometimes when women
                stop trying -- it can happen. She
                knows other couples that adopt and
                then get pregnant.

                           CARRIE
                Sweetie.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Carrie -- I'm pregnant!

      Happy, happy tears. Carrie hugs her.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                I guess, in certain houses, fairy
                tales do come true.


140   INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE -- DAY -- FALL                140

      Halloween costume aisle. Carrie and Miranda browse.

                          CARRIE
                I can't believe you're even
                dressing up.

                                               92.


                    MIRANDA
          All the parents at Brady's school
          dress up -- it's fun! Fun thought
          up by a group of non-working
          mothers with nothing else to do all
          day.

Miranda stops, looks at the costumes hanging there.

                    MIRANDA (CONT'D)
          Witch and -- "sexy kitten". That's
          it? The only two choices for women.
          Witch and Sexy kitten.

                    CARRIE
          You said a mouthful there, sister.

Miranda holds up a mask of a ghoul screaming in horror.

                    MIRANDA
          Maybe I should just wear this and a
          business suit and go as myself.

                    CARRIE
              (re; mask)
          Speaking of monsters -- I got an
          email from Big.

Miranda looks over at her.

                     CARRIE (CONT'D)
          "I don't know what to say."
              (beat)
          Ah... then don't send an email.

                    MIRANDA
          What were you expecting?

No idea. Miranda grabs a witch hat. They start walking away.
They round a corner, CHILD wearing a mask pops up.

                    CHILD
          Boo!

Carrie smiles. The child walks away.

                    CARRIE
          Gonna take a little more than that
          to scare me after what I have been
          through.

They start walking toward the check-out counter.

                                                      93.


                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And in the subject box: two words:
                I'm sorry.

                          MIRANDA
                Steve is all about "I'm sorry." I'm
                sorry emails -- I'm sorry voice
                mails -- I'm sorry flowers -- I'm
                sorry cards. How about: don't do
                anything to be: " I'm sorry" for.

                          CARRIE
                Maybe he's sorry.

                          MIRANDA
                Maybe Big is too.

                           CARRIE
                Point taken.
                    (beat)
                I still can't believe this happened
                to me. I know it happened, but I
                can't believe it happened. I lay
                awake at night going over every
                detail of the last week in my head.

                          MIRANDA
                Carrie -- There's a detail I've
                been meaning to tell you about --

      Carrie spots something; GRABS Miranda's arm with horror.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And then I saw it...the only thing
                scary enough to scare me after the
                experience I'd been through.

      On the rack in the front register -- Vogue!


141   INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE -- MOMENTS LATER -- FALL        141

      Carrie and Miranda stand looking at an open Vogue:

      "The Last Single Girl: Carrie Bradshaw Gets Married."

                          MIRANDA
                You look great, you look amazing.
                So. That's the worst of it.

      Carrie flips a page. She noticed something.

                                                    94.


                          CARRIE
                Wait -- what's that say? In the box
                at the end?

                          MIRANDA
                    (reading)
                "Editor's note: The wedding of
                Carrie Bradshaw and John James
                Preston was cancelled as this issue
                went to press. Carrie Bradshaw
                is...

      Miranda stops reading.   Carrie looks at her.

                           CARRIE
                Is what?

      Miranda doesn't want to respond. Carrie pushes the magazine
      further away so she can read it.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                    (reads)
                "Carrie Bradshaw is still single
                and living in Manhattan."


142   EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS -- LATER -- FALL                   142

      A wind kicks up, autumn leaves blow. Carrie walks down the
      street, the Vogue under her arm, angry.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                I didn't want to buy it - but I
                figured it was one less Vogue in
                New York.


143   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- FALL                  143

      Carrie's door opens. Charlotte stands in the hall with Lily.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I saw it. The pictures are
                gorgeous.

                          CARRIE
                Yes -- I'm a beautiful bride. Come
                in.

      They walk in, Carrie closes the door.

                                             94A.


                    CHARLOTTE
          Look, the people who don't know --
          will only see the beautiful
          pictures. The people who do know
          will only see what an asshole he
          is.
              (beat; to Lily)
          Mommy said a bad word.

                     CARRIE
              (looks down to Lily)
          Hi, honey.

Lily holds up a little baby pumpkin to Carrie.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          For me?

Lily nods. Carrie has to lighten up. She kneels to Lily.

                                                     95.


                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And what are you going to be for
                Halloween?

                          LILY
                Cinderella.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Or -- we also brought Mulan.

      Lily shakes her head: NO. Carrie smiles.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                Would you like to go trick or
                treating with us?

                             LILY
                Yea!

                          CHARLOTTE
                Just in our building -- if you feel
                up to it.

                             LILY
                Yea!

                             CARRIE
                       (How can I not?)
                Yea!


144   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT/HALL -- NIGHT -- FALL           144

      Carrie knocks on Charlotte's front door. It opens. Charlotte
      stands there -- dressed as a cute cow. With udders on her
      belly. Harry is Uncle Fester. Lily is Cinderella in a MASK.

                          HARRY
                No costume?

                          CARRIE
                Look closer. I'm the scariest thing
                in New York. Jilted at Forty-one.
                Boo.

      Harry Laughs. So does Charlotte...even Carrie smiles.


145   INT. CHARLOTTE'S BUILDING/HALL -- LATER -- FALL            145

      They walk down the hall. Carrie is holding Lily's hand.

                                                    96.


                          CARRIE
                You know you have to give me some
                of your loot, right?

      Lily nods Carrie smiles. Harry knocks on a door. It opens. A
      PARK AVE WOMAN (40), stylish - stands there with treats.

                          CHARLOTTE/HARRY/LILY
                Trick or treat!

      The woman smiles -- then suddenly, her smile fades.

                          WOMAN
                Oh, Carrie, I saw Vogue -- I'm so
                sorry.

      Carrie reacts, mortified.


146   INT. CHARLOTTE'S BUILDING/HALL -- LATER -- FALL             146

      Another door opens. A PREPPY WOMAN (36) is there.

                          CHARLOTTE/HARRY/LILY
                Trick or treat!

      REVEAL: Carrie's face -- hidden behind the Cinderella mask.


147   INT. HAIR SALON -- DAY -- FALL                              147

      A STYLIST is blowing out a woman with dark chestnut brown
      hair. Reveal the woman's face: It's Carrie --


148   INT. STARBUCKS -- LATER THAT DAY -- FALL                    148

      Raining outside. Louise walks in, looks around.

                          CARRIE
                Louise!

      Double-take. Carrie is waving to her from a table.

                          LOUISE
                Oh my Lord. I did not even
                recognize you.

                          CARRIE
                That's the point. My head is the
                witness protection program.

                                                    97.


                          LOUISE
                I'm really feeling that look on
                you.

      Louise reaches into her purse to get something --

                          CARRIE
                And I am feeling that Balenciaga on
                you.

                          LOUISE
                Mine till Tuesday.

      Louise pulls out a cell phone and holds it out to her.

                          LOUISE (CONT'D)
                Here -- time to re-join the world.

                           CARRIE
                Already?

      Louise nods. Carrie takes the phone.

                          LOUISE
                Your new number... area code: 347 --

                          CARRIE
                Hold, Hold, Hold. 347? No, no. I'm
                a 917 gal. Always have been.

                          LOUISE
                No longer available. Now, you're
                347.

                          CARRIE
                Great. Now even I don't recognize
                me.


149   EXT. BEACHOUSE/DECK -- DAY -- FALL                        149

      Samantha sits on her deck. Her phone rings.

                          SAMANTHA
                Samantha Jones.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Carrie Bradshaw --


150   EXT. NYC STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- FALL                     150

      Intercut with Carrie walking along.

                                                    98.


                          CARRIE
                -- Or I used to be.

                          SAMANTHA
                Talk to me.

                          CARRIE
                I'm a 347 area code. How tacky is
                that?

                          SAMANTHA
                347 is the new New York.

                          CARRIE
                I want the old New York with the
                old 917 and my old will to live.

                          SAMANTHA
                Old New York, new New York -- honey
                -- at least it's New York.

      She looks -- Dante is coming out of the surf in his wetsuit.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                Another hard thing about being in
                L.A? My "sex on a stick" next door
                neighbor. I can't stop looking at
                him.

                           CARRIE
                Looking?

                          SAMANTHA
                Just looking. After I saw Steve's
                face at the rehearsal dinner, I
                could never ---

      Dante notices her on the deck. He gives her a sexy smile.
      She doesn't acknowledge it -- turns away and walks inside.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                But you should see this guy. Every
                night sex with a different partner.
                He's like --
                    (searching then realizing)
                --Me. Five years ago.

                           CARRIE
                Yes.   When I was a 212.


151   EXT. RODEO DRIVE -- DAY -- FALL                           151

      Samantha strolls along Rodeo Drive.

                                             98A.


                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          And in an effort to stay out of her
          house and out of trouble --
          Samantha went shopping.

She notices a sidewalk "dog rescue station." Cute puppies
frolic and play in a wire pen.

                                                       99.


      In the back of the pen sits a tattered tiny DOG.   Alone.
      Samantha can't help but look at it.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                It certainly wasn't the cutest dog
                in the pen - but their was
                something about it --

      The dog looks up at her -- Dark marks under its eyes. The
      Rescue Woman (40) notices Samantha looking.

                          RESCUE WOMAN
                She needs a good a home.
                Interested?

      Samantha shakes her head; "no."

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And just as Samantha convinced
                herself that the dog wasn't for
                her.

      The dog starts humping a stuffed animal.

                          RESCUE WOMAN
                She's been fixed, but she hasn't
                lost the urge.


152   INT. DOG GROOMER'S -- LATER -- FALL                          152

      Samantha holds the dog while talking to two GROOMERS.

                          SAMANTHA
                And she needs a little eye work.
                Anything you can do about these
                stains?

      The dog looks up at her. She looks down at it.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    (to dog)
                Honey, I don't mince words.


153   EXT. RODEO DRIVE -- LATER -- FALL                            153

      Samantha and the dog walk out of Gucci in matching outfits...
      looking fabulous. Three GUCCI SALESMEN follow them holding
      large Gucci bags. They walk to her sleek Mercedes SUV --
      parked at the curb.

                                             99A.


JUMP CUT TO: The back of the Mercedes SUV filled with
shopping bags: Gucci, Prada, Dior -- the SUV hatch is closed,
revealing Samantha's licence plate: I HEART NY. Samantha
pulls away, the dog in her lap -- fur blowing.

                                                    100.


154   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT                           154

      Carrie and Louise are in the closet unloading clothes from
      the boxes. Carrie opens a wardrobe box -- It's the WEDDING
      GOWN. They both look at it - not knowing what to do.

                          LOUISE
                Do you want me to get rid of it?

                          CARRIE
                No, it's too beautiful. I'll just
                bury it deep in the back -- like I
                did my feelings.

      Carries closes the box back up. Louise watches; then.

                          LOUISE
                Do you miss him?

                          CARRIE
                    (beat; then)
                Every day. You know, it's weird --
                I haven't cried very much at all.
                Maybe you're only allotted a
                certain amount of tears per man --
                and I used mine up.

      Carrie gently pushes the box away. Opens another.

                          LOUISE
                Yeah. I know how you feel `cause,
                my college boyfriend broke up with
                me last year. And I miss him all
                the time.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Suddenly, it dawned on me -- there
                were two broken hearts in my-walk
                in.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Louise -- we need a cocktail. Grab
                your rental.

      Carrie starts out. Louise grabs her purse and follows.


155   INT. THE CARLYLE HOTEL/BAR -- A LITTLE LATER -- FALL       155

      Carrie and Louise are having cocktails.

                                              101.


                    LOUISE
          And it threw me so hard `cause, you
          know, I thought Will -- that's his
          name... was the love of my life.

                    CARRIE
          What happened?

                    LOUISE
          He said he loved me and all -- but
          didn't think I was "the one".

Carrie looks at her, nods.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          And that hurt. But -- you know --
          whatever. I'm not going to give up
          on love.

                      CARRIE
          Good.

                    LOUISE
          Love is the thing, you know.

She holds up her key chain. The word "Love" in gold.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          See that. I'm bringing it to me all
          day long.

Louise gets a "text".  She reaches over and looks.     She
smiles as she reads it. Carrie raises her eyebrow.

                    CARRIE
          Oh, I remember that smile.   Who's
          the guy?

                    LOUISE
          Someone I just met. He wants me to
          meet him for a drink.

                      CARRIE
          At 11:30?     That's a bootie call.

                    LOUISE
          No, it's not like that... he just
          got off work -- he's a waiter.

                    CARRIE
          Louise, I may not get texts and I
          may not send texts -- but trust me:
          The sub-text of that text: Bootie.

                                                   101A.


       Louise nods, then starts texting him.

                           LOUISE
                 But it's not a bootie call if he
                 meets me.... right?

                           CARRIE
                 All right, then. You kids enjoy.
                 That's what your twenties are for.
                 Your thirties are to learn the
                 lessons.

       Carrie stands up, throws some money on the bar.

                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                 And your forties are to pay for
                 drinks.


156    INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- FALL                 156

       Charlotte sits on the couch, reading a magazine. The three
       dogs near her. Harry enters.

                           HARRY
                 You going for your run?

                             CHARLOTTE
                 Um... no.

                           HARRY
                 You didn't go yesterday either.

                             CHARLOTTE
                 I know.

                                                   102.


                          HARRY
                Why is that?

                          CHARLOTTE
                    (snapping)
                I don't feel like running!

                          HARRY
                    (as he goes)
                Okay. Welcome to the house of
                hormones.


157   INT. UPSCALE FURNITURE STORE -- DAY -- FALL               157

      Carrie and Charlotte walk looking at furniture.

                           CARRIE
                It's all about the desk. If I find
                the desk, the writing will come.
                And it better `cause I'm using my
                new book advance to pay the fancy
                decorator.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I think it's so great that you are
                re-doing your entire apartment.

                          CARRIE
                Out with the old --
                    (looks at price tag)
                -- In with the overpriced.

      Charlotte smiles. Carrie links arms with her.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Hey, Harry called me and mentioned
                you're not running.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Why'd he do that?

                           CARRIE
                `Cause he loves you... and he's
                concerned.

                          CHARLOTTE
                There is nothing to be concerned
                about.

                          CARRIE
                Did the doctor say it wasn't safe
                or something?

                                             103.


                    CHARLOTTE
          No, she said because I'm already a
          runner -- it's fine.

                    CARRIE
          So, why are you not --

                    CHARLOTTE
          I'm afraid something bad will
          happen. It's a miracle that I'm
          even pregnant.

                    CARRIE
          But if the doctor said --

                    CHARLOTTE
          It's not rational, Carrie... it's
          irrational. I know that.

                      CARRIE
          Okay.

                     CHARLOTTE
          I've got everything I ever wanted.
          I'm so happy -- I'm terrified.
              (beat)
          No one gets everything they want.
          Look at you. Look at Miranda.
          You're such good people and look
          what happened to you. Of course,
          something bad is going to happen to
          me.

                    CARRIE
          Sweetie, you shit your pants this
          year. Maybe you're done.

Charlotte laughs a little. Carrie moves her along.

                      CARRIE (CONT'D)
          You run   every day -- that's what
          you do.   You can't stop being who
          you are   -- just because you're
          afraid.   Right?

Charlotte nods, they walk on, linked together.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Now let's get down to business.
          I've got to have my apartment done
          in time for that baby shower.

                                                    104.


158    EXT. CENTRAL PARK/RESERVOIR -- DAY -- FALL                158

       AUTUMN LEAVES fall as Charlotte walks onto the running track
       with the three dogs on leashes. She starts to run --
       tentative -- slowly. They trot along with her.


158A   EXT. CENTRAL PARK/RESERVOIR -- DAY -- LATE FALL          158A

       Charlotte runs faster - more confident. The dogs run along
       with her -- they are wearing Burberry pet sweaters.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 And as the last of the autumn
                 leaves fell away -- so did
                 Charlotte's fear.


158B   EXT. CENTRAL PARK/RESERVOIR -- DAY -- WINTER             158B

       SNOWFLAKES float down. Charlotte, dressed for winter runs in
       form -- alone. A smile on her face.


159    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                  159

       Carrie sits at her card table "temp" desk. Louise is sorting
       through a stack of mail.

                           LOUISE
                 You sure you don't want me to RSVP
                 to some of these holiday parties?

                            CARRIE
                 Yep. I'm perfectly happy spending
                 time home alone.
                     (beat)
                 And speaking of home -- you're
                 going to miss your plane.

       Louise takes a gift wrapped present out of her purse

                           LOUISE
                 Merry Christmas. It's just
                 something silly.

       Carrie opens it. A DVD of "MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS."

                           CARRIE
                 Oh... Louise from St. Louis.

                           LOUISE
                 You said you never saw it -- so.

                                           104A.


                   CARRIE
         Now, I feel bad. If I had known we
         were going to exchange gifts --

                                                      105.


        Carrie gets up and RUNS to her closet.

                            CARRIE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                  I would have bought you one two
                  weeks ago and hidden it in here.

        She comes back out with a large circular BOX tied with satin
        ribbons. It says: Louis Vuitton.

                            LOUISE
                  No! That is not what I think it is.

                             CARRIE
                  Open it.

                            LOUISE
                  Oh my Lord. Oh my --

        She opens it and SCREAMS as she pulls out a gorgeous purse.

                            CARRIE
                  No more rent girl for you.

        Louise throws it over her shoulder and walks "runway."

                            LOUISE
                  Look who's home from the big city!

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  It was the best money I'd ever
                  spent.


159A    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- WINTER                159A

        Carrie comes out of her kitchen, holding a Cup O'Soup. She is
        wearing pajamas and socks.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  New Year's Eve... and a Cup O'Soup.

        She plops in a chair in front of the TV. She picks up the
        "Meet Me in St. Louis" DVD and looks at it.


159AA   INT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENTS -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER        159AA

        Steve is standing in the open doorway -- with his coat and
        hat on. Miranda is kneeling -- putting a winter coat on
        Brady. A Christmas tree glows behind them.

                            MIRANDA
                  And what are you gonna say at
                  midnight?

                                            105A.


                    BRADY
          Happy New Year.

                    MIRANDA
          That's right -- but you gotta say
          it more excited than that --
              (then; excited)
          "Happy New Year!"

                    BRADY
          Happy New Year!

                    MIRANDA
          You say that and then... you kiss.

She gives him a big kiss. He laughs. She stands.

                    STEVE
          You all ready to go, B-boy?

                    MIRANDA
          Did you pack the new Batman Santa
          brought you?

Brady shakes his head: NO.

                    STEVE
          Aw man -- Gotta have the new
          Batman.

                    MIRANDA
          It's there near the tree.

Brady leaves to get it. Steve looks over at Miranda.

                    STEVE
          You got plans with the girls?

                    MIRANDA
          We're all kinda staying in tonight.

                    STEVE
          Would you like to come and eat with
          us? We can go somewhere over here
          on your side.

                    MIRANDA
          No, thank you.


                    STEVE
          Miranda -- I never meant to hurt
          you.

                                                      105B.


        She looks away. Brady comes up back to them with Batman.

                            MIRANDA
                  There he is. Batman.

                            STEVE
                  Put your hat on. It's snowing out.

        Brady nods and takes Steve's hand.   Steve looks over at
        Miranda.

                            STEVE (CONT'D)
                  Happy New Year.

                            MIRANDA
                  Happy New Year.

                            BRADY
                  Kiss.

        Silence... then, Miranda bends down and gives Brady a big
        sloppy kiss.

                            MIRANDA
                  See you tomorrow.

        She stands up and closes the door. As it closes, Steve looks
        at her. Finally; it is closed -- she leans against it.


159AB   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER            159AB

        Carrie sips soup watching a "deliriously in love" Judy
        Garland sing "The Trolley Song."

                            JUDY GARLAND
                  ZING ZING ZING WENT MY HEARTSTRINGS
                  THE MOMENT I MET HIM -- I FELL

        Carrie, not in the mood, picks up the remote -- clicks. The
        TV goes off. She looks around: Now what?


159AC   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- WINTER                 159AC

        Carrie sits at her makeshift desk as snow falls outside her
        window. She looks down at the computer; motionless. CLOSE ON
        SCREEN: The only thing written on it is the word: "Love."
        After a beat Carrie types three dots. She thinks, then
        deletes two of the dots. Her phone rings. She answers it.

                            CARRIE
                  Hello?

                                                     105C.


159B   INT. BUDDAKAN/RED ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER             159B

       Stanford sits in a festive booth with festive FRIENDS.

                           STANFORD
                 Happy New Year -- We're having a
                 fabulous time. The only thing
                 missing is you. Come.

                           CARRIE
                 That's sweet but I can't, I'm
                 writing.

                           STANFORD
                 Oh... Okay.
                     (beat;then)
                 You're not really writing are you?

                           CARRIE
                 No. You're not really having a
                 fabulous time are you?

                           STANFORD
                 No. Rescue me. It's very forced
                 festive.

                           CARRIE
                 Oh yes, that's just what every New
                 Year's Eve party needs: a visit
                 from the lost Bronte sister.

                           STANFORD
                 Well... Better a Bronte sister than
                 a Hilton sister.

                           CARRIE
                     (laughs; then)
                 Thanks but -- by ten PM I'll be in
                 bed asleep and blissfully unaware
                 of how fabulous this night is
                 supposed to be.


159C   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- WINTER                 159C

       Carrie is sound asleep. Her phone rings. She grabs it.

                           CARRIE
                 Hello.

                                                   105D.


159D   INT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENTS -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER        159D

       Intercut with Miranda -- sitting on her couch watching the
       New Year's Eve coverage on television. Chinese take-out is on
       the table in front of her.

                            MIRANDA
                 I thought one of the perks of
                 having a family is you don't have
                 to spend New Year's Eve alone with
                 Chinese food.
                     (beat)
                 I'm alone with Chinese food.

                           CARRIE
                 I was sleeping.

                           MIRANDA
                 Oh, shit -- I'm sorry.

                           CARRIE
                 That's okay. Where's Brady?

                           MIRANDA
                 It's Steve's night.

                           CARRIE
                 Right.

                           MIRANDA
                 Go back to sleep -- don't wake up.

                           CARRIE
                 It's okay. Are you alright?

                           MIRANDA
                 I'm fine -- I was just getting a
                 little choked-up watching the
                 stupid New Year's Eve stuff on TV
                 alone.

                           CARRIE
                 Want me to come over?

                           MIRANDA
                 I'm all the way downtown --

                           CARRIE
                 I can grab a cab --

                           MIRANDA
                 On New Year's Eve? No way. I'm
                 fine... really.
                           (MORE)

                                                   105E.

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                 I just wanted to talk a little. Go
                 back to sleep. Good night.

       Miranda hangs up. Carrie lays there -- holding the phone.
       She looks over at her bedside table clock: 11:12. She thinks
       then -- throws back the covers and gets out of bed. START
       MUSIC.


159E   EXT. CARRIE'S BULIDING -- NIGHT -- WINTER                159E

       Snowing. Carrie hurries out of her front door -- a coat
       thrown over her pajamas. She comes down the stairs to the
       street looking for a cab. Nothing. No traffic. She starts
       RUNNING up the block -- passing TWO FESTIVE COUPLES; walking.


159F   INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- WINTER            159F

       Lily, in her PJ's, is marching around the den wearing a
       "Happy New Year" party crown and blowing into a party favor
       horn. Harry and Charlotte -- wearing New Year's Eve party
       hats -- sit on the couch -- laughing. Charlotte and Harry
       kiss. His hand moves sensuously down Charlotte's body and
       rests on her pregnant belly.

                                                     106.

       Samantha and Smith recline on the couch. They are wearing
       sexy black robes and having caviar and champagne. The Dog
       sits nearby... a fire roars in the fireplace behind them.
       Samantha and Smith kiss on the couch. The Dog humps a pillow
       nearby.

       Anthony stands talking to FRIENDS. Someone taps him on the
       shoulder. He looks over -- it's Stanford -- holding two
       glasses of champagne. Stanford and Anthony look at each
       other as everyone around them kisses. Stanford presents his
       cheek. Anthony kisses it.


166B   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE STREET -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER        166B

       Snowing. Carrie runs up the stairs of the Lower East Side

       PEOPLE blowing party horns and LAUGHING.

       Louise is talking to a group of St. Louis FRIENDS. She looks
       up as WILL (22) her handsome African-American ex-boyfriend
       enters. Their eyes meet. Her heart stops. He smiles. She
       smiles. He starts over to her. They stand talking -- she
       smiles. He smiles.

168C   EXT. LOWER EAST APARTMENT DAY -- NIGHT -- WINTER          168C

       Miranda opens a fortune cookie -- and reads it. Tosses it
       down. Picks up another -- cracks it open. Reads it. Tosses it
       down. She looks like she might cry.


168D   EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER -- WINTER 8D
                                                               16

       Miranda opens the door -- Carrie is standing there -- out of
       breath.

                              CARRIE
                    You're not alone.

       Times Square is seen on the television in the background.

                                 TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    5-4-3-2-1.     Happy New Year!

       Snow on the ground -- COLD. CROWDS gathered in front of the
       large fashion tent. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha
       trudge through the snow to the stairs. Samantha is wearing
       lots of fur. She SLIPS on some ice -- Carrie catches her.

                               CARRIE
                  Easy girl.

                            SAMANTHA
                  Thanks -- Three months driving in
                  L.A. and I forgot how to use my
                  fucking legs.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  Every year the women of New York
                  leave the past behind and look
                  forward to the future... this is
                  known as Fashion Week.

       They make their way up the stairs to the tent entrance.


176    INT. LOBBY TENT -- CONTINOUS -- WINTER                      176

       The lobby is buzzing with PRESS and CROWDS OF FASHIONISTAS.
       The GIRLS enter and make their way through the crowd.

                            CARRIE
                  This way. I hear the couture
                  calling my name.

                            SAMANTHA
                  See this -- this is what I miss.
                  Last night Smith and I cuddled in
                  front of the TV with "take out"
                  Mexican.                                               

                            MIRANDA                                      
                  -- In your four billion dollar                         
                  beach house.                                           

       The girls LAUGH.

                            SAMANTHA                                     
                  Still -- I don't think I'm cut out                     
                  for the one-on-one relationship
                  thing.

                                            108A.


                    CHARLOTTE
          You've been doing it for five
          years.

                    SAMANTHA
          No, see -- I've always had
          girlfriends on the side.

They smile. Miranda spots MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG across the
room.

                    MIRANDA
          There's Mayor Bloomberg.                             

                    SAMANTHA                                   
          New Yorkers are so damn attractive -                 
          - Even the Mayor is hot.                             

                    MIRANDA                                    
          I believe that was his last                          
          campaign slogan.                                     

The girls walk on.                                             

                                                   109.


178   INT. FASHION TENT -- A LITTLE LATER -- WINTER               178

      The room is filling up and buzzing with FASHIONISTAS as the
      girls make their way. Samantha spots her name on four chairs
      in the front row and leads the way.

                          SAMANTHA
                There we are.

                          CHARLOTTE
                We're in the front row?!

                          SAMANTHA
                I pulled some strings.

                             CARRIE
                Very nice.

                          SAMANTHA
                I should go thank them --

      Samantha throws her coat on her chair back.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Decide where we want to go for
                lunch -- I'll make the call.
                    (beat; excited)
                It's like old times.

      Samantha hurries off, excited. Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte
      settle into their seats.

                          MIRANDA
                So, this is how you all spent your
                Saturdays while I was with Brady
                and Steve at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

                          CARRIE
                Well... Not every Saturday.

                          MIRANDA
                Just so you know -- We always had
                front row at the mammal show.
                    (beat; then)
                Steve does the funniest dolphin
                impression. Actually, it's more --
                Steve as a dolphin --

      A smile escapes her -- they look at her. Her smile fades.


                    CHARLOTTE
          You really can't forgive him?

                    MIRANDA
          Are you suggesting something?

                    CHARLOTTE
          I like Steve. I've always liked
          Steve -- He's apologized a hundred
          times -- he's not seeing anyone
          else. What's it going to take?

                    MIRANDA
          And are you also suggesting that
          she forgive Big?

                    CHARLOTTE
          No. I could kill Big. Sometimes
          when I'm running -- I imagine what
          I'd say if I ever saw him again. I
          have the perfect opening sentence.
          Want to hear it?

                     CARRIE
              (duh?)
          Ah.... yes.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I curse the day you were born.

                    CARRIE
          Impressive. Better work up a hand
          gesture to go with it.

Elaine comes up to Carrie, squats down in front of her.

                    ELAINE
          Thank god you're here. They have me
          covering this Mercedes-Benz fashion
          week and I'm desperate for a Carrie
          Bradshaw-esque quote.

                    CARRIE
          Well, I'll do my best. We'll talk
          after?

                    ELAINE
          Great. And -- ooh -- my back --

She gets up -- sits in Samantha's empty chair next to Carrie.


                           ELAINE (CONT'D)
                     (very sincere)
                 -- Can I just say that I'm so sorry
                 about what happened with your
                 wedding.

       Carrie smiles -- what else can she do?

                           ELAINE (CONT'D)
                 I don't know how you survived it.
                 I, personally, was so devastated I
                 took myself off JDate -- but you
                 survived and you're here and you
                 look amazing and I just think
                 that's so great. Everyone in my row
                 does -- we can't stop talking about
                 it. Okay -- Meet you in the lobby
                 after.

       Elaine smiles and leaves. Carrie sits -- stunned; numb. She
       looks to the chairs across the runway -- FASHIONABLE WOMEN
       are looking back at her -- one or two smile sympathetically.
       She grabs her things and then turns to Charlotte.

                           CARRIE
                 I've gotta go.

       Carrie slips silently away. Charlotte gets up and starts away
       after her. Miranda looks --

                           MIRANDA
                 Should I --

       Charlotte shakes her head: "not sure"... and continues
       away...


178A   INT. FASHION SHOW TENT/ENTRANCE AREA -- MOMENTS LATER      178A

       Charlotte catches up with Carrie as she is about to exit.
       Fashionistas stream by them on their way in.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Carrie, wait.

       Carrie stops -- turns around -- putting on her wrap.

                           CARRIE
                 This was a mistake -- it's too soon
                 -- I'm not ready. I'll go get a
                 coffee and you guys call me after --
                 and I'll meet you for lunch.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Are you sure? I know how much you
                 were looking forward to this.

                           CARRIE
                 Yeah, I really was... until I
                 became the poster child for wounded
                 women everywhere.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 You're not.

                           CARRIE
                 Is this thing going to effect
                 everything I do for the rest of my
                 life?

                           CHARLOTTE
                 No -- but if you leave right now --
                 it will effect the rest of your
                 day.

       Carrie looks at her -- takes this in.

                            CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                     (softly)
                 It's Fashion Week. We're in the
                 front row.

                           CARRIE
                 Where everyone can see me.

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Who cares about them -- You only
                 came for the clothes.

       Carrie smiles... a little.

                           CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                 I know it's hard but -- It's like
                 you said: You can't stop being who
                 you are.


178B   INT. FASHION SHOW TENT -- MOMENTS LATER                  178B

       Samantha and Miranda have just gathered their things and are
       leaving their chairs as Charlotte and Carrie return.

                           SAMANTHA
                 We thought we were leaving.

       Charlotte shakes her head: NO. Samantha and Miranda turn
       around and start back to their seats as -- MUSIC STARTS...

       LIGHTS CHANGE. The girls settle in just as a MODEL starts
       down the RUNWAY in gorgeous clothes. Carrie, Miranda,
       Charlotte and Samantha watch --

       DISSOLVE TO: the girls watching another model; another
       outfit. They point and discuss what they see -- loving it.

       DISSOLVE TO: the girls watching another model; another
       outfit. With each outfit Carrie seems to lighten and
       brighten.

       DISSOLVE TO: the girls watching another model; another
       outfit. Carrie smiles as she watches -- now, truly enjoying
       herself.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


178C   INT. LOBBY TENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- WINTER                 178C

       Carrie is being interviewed by Elaine holding a TAPE
       RECORDER. Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte watch nearby.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 I didn't know if it was the fashion
                 or the fact that the four of us
                 were together again -- but for the
                 first time in a long time -- I felt
                 like myself.


183   EXT. BRYANT PARK -- MOMENTS LATER -- WINTER               183

      The girls leave the tent and start down the stairs.

                          SAMANTHA
                Let's get a cab -- I am starv --

      SPLAT. Her fur coat is hit with SPLASH of red paint. They
      REACT: SHOCKED. AN ACTIVIST WOMAN stands there holding a
      paint cup. Next to her -- another ACTIVIST is holding a PUG
      dog.

                          ACTIVIST #1
                Fur is murder!

                           ACTIVIST #2
                MUR-DER.   MUR-DER.

                           SAMANTHA
                    (beat)
                God, I miss New York.


184   EXT. NYC STREET -- DAY -- WINTER                          184

      Carrie hurries across the street --

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And a couple of weeks later -- I
                met St. Louise's St. Louis
                boyfriend, Will.

      She arrives at the front of a restaurant. Through the window,
      she can see Louise sitting next to Will. Louise spots Carrie
      and waves. Carrie waves back and starts in.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Over Christmas they realized how
                much they loved each other. Just in
                time for Valentine's day.


185   INT. CARRIE'S BUILDING/FOYER -- LATER -- WINTER           185

      Carrie turns the key in her mail box. A little pink envelope
      sits there. She takes it out and opens it. It's a "kid's
      style" Valentine card of Cinderella. She turns it over.
      Lily's crayon mark mixes with Charlotte's handwriting: To
      Aunt Carrie... Love, Lily.


186   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- A LITTLE LATER -- WINTER       186

      Carrie opens the door, holding the valentine. Her phone is
      ringing. She answers it.

                           CARRIE
                Hello?


187   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- LATER -- WINTER                 187

      Intercut with Samantha in her kitchen attempting to make
      sushi. Her hands covered in rice. The DOG, wearing a sweater
      with a "heart" on it sits on the floor watching.

                          SAMANTHA
                I'm just calling to make sure you
                aren't hanging from your shower
                rod.

                          CARRIE
                You called an hour too early.

                          SAMANTHA
                So, what's the V-day plan?

                          CARRIE
                Miranda and I are going to dinner
                and then a really violent slasher
                movie.

                           SAMANTHA
                Perfect.

                           CARRIE
                And you?

                          SAMANTHA
                I am making Smith sushi. Pause for
                reaction.

                          CARRIE
                Wow. Do you make sushi?


                          SAMANTHA
                We took a class a while back -- and
                when he walks in the door at seven-
                thirty, I am going to surprise him
                by laying on the dining room table -
                -- covered with homemade sushi.

                          CARRIE
                Boy, you do have time on your
                hands.


188   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- WINTER        188

      Carrie walks over to the book shelf and places the Cinderella
      valentine on it. She looks down at the bottom shelf. The
      Vogue magazine is looking up at her -- She picks it up.


189   INT. VILLAGE RESTAURANT -- LATER -- WINTER                189

      A small, village restaurant festively decorated for
      Valentine's Day. Pink balloons float on the ceiling, their
      red ribbon strings hang at eye level. Carrie and Miranda sit
      at a table. At all the other tables -- Couples!

                          MIRANDA
                Is it me or is Valentine's Day this
                year on steroids?

                          CARRIE
                I think it was like this last year
                but we played for the other team.

      A WAITRESS (23) approaches them with pink menus.

                          WAITRESS
                Good evening. Here's our special
                Valentine night menu. All the
                selections are romantic in theme
                and designed to be split for two.
                Are you having wine?

                          CARRIE/MIRANDA
                Yes.

                          WAITRESS
                A glass or a bot --

                          CARRIE/MIRANDA
                Bottle.


                          WAITRESS
                I'll be right back to take you and
                your girlfriends order.

      The waitress leaves. Miranda looks at Carrie.

                          MIRANDA
                I could do a lot worse.


190   INT. VILLAGE RESTAURANT -- LATER -- WINTER                190

      The wine bottle is now empty. Carrie and Miranda eat.

                          MIRANDA
                Why would you look at the Vogue
                today of all days?

                          CARRIE
                `Cause -- I'm an emotional cutter.
                    (Beat;then)
                I deserve what I got. Running all
                over New York believing that I'm
                finally getting my happy ending.
                "See everyone, love does conquer
                all. Look at me in my one of a kind
                wedding gown marrying the love of
                my life."

      Waitress stops at the table. She picks up the bottle.

                          WAITRESS
                Would you like another bot --

                          CARRIE/MIRANDA
                Yes.

      She leaves.

                          CARRIE
                And Miranda... in that article -- I
                did not say "we" once. It was all:
                "I" want and "I" think.

                          MIRANDA
                It was from your point of view.

                          CARRIE
                My point of view... Exactly. The
                whole wedding was my point of view.
                I let the wedding get bigger than
                Big. I am the reason he didn't get
                out of that car.

                                           116A.


                   MIRANDA
         You can't put this all on yourself.
             (beat; then)
         Okay. I said something I shouldn't
         have said to Big at the rehearsal
         dinner.

                                             117.


                    CARRIE
          What do you mean?

                    MIRANDA
          I was really upset after Steve
          showed up and I bumped into Big and
          -- I said that you two were crazy
          to get married.

Carrie is stunned. The waitress arrives with the new bottle
of wine.

                    WAITRESS
          Here we go. Your Shiraz.

She is opening the bottle. Tension. She pops the cork --
starts to pour.

                    MIRANDA
          Stop -- It's fine -- Thanks.

The Waitress puts the bottle down and walks away.

                    MIRANDA (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I was upset-- Steve had--

                    CARRIE
          I have been going over this and
          over this in my mind for five
          months -- and -- for five months
          you kept a secret like that?

                    MIRANDA
          I tried to tell you once but the
          Vogue article came out --

                    CARRIE
          Once? You tried to tell me once?
          You should have tried to tell me
          every single day!

                    MIRANDA
          I know, I was looking for the right
          time.

                    CARRIE
          There is no right time to tell me
          you ruined my marriage!

The Room is now at "attention."

                                                   118.


                          MIRANDA
                It just happened -- I wasn't
                thinking.

      Carrie grabs her purse -- to leave.

                          MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                Carrie, please -- Don't go -- I --

      Carrie stands up -- the festive balloon strings bob in front
      of her face. She pushes them away.

                           CARRIE
                And I think what hurts the most is
                that you kept a secret from me. I
                have never ever kept a secret from
                you. Ever!

      She starts out. Stops, comes back -- through the ribbons.

                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                No, I'm lying. For the last five
                months I've been thinking that it's
                a huge mistake that you left Steve.
                    (beat)
                There. How does it feel?

      She turns and pushes balloons out of her way as she starts
      out. A KISSING COUPLE (20's) is BLOCKING her way.

                             CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Excuse me!

      They stop -- She squeezes by them. Miranda is devastated.


191   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER 1
                                                               19

      Candles are lit. Samantha enters wearing a sexy sheer robe
      and carrying a giant tray of homemade sushi. The phone rings.
      The machine picks up. Smith leaves a message.

                          SMITH (V.O.)
                Babe -- we're way behind on set. I
                still haven't been released. I'll
                get there as soon as I can.

      She SIGHS -- places the tray on the table. Looks at the wall
      clock: Seven-thirty.

                                                  118A.


192   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- LATER -- WINTER             192

      Eight o'clock. Samantha is sitting in the robe near the
      table. Not pleased.


193   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- LATER -- WINTER             193

      Eight-thirty -- Samantha is pacing. She takes a piece of
      sushi -- pops it in her mouth and chews -- pissed. A WOMAN
      MOANING is heard. She walks over and glances out the window
      into Dante's living room. Candles are everywhere -- he is
      naked and GIVING HEAD to naked BLONDE WOMAN. She is writhing
      in pleasure. Samantha watches -- even more pissed.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                It was the same Valentine night
                Samantha had planned -- minus the
                sushi.

                                                    119.


194   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- LATER                            194

      Samantha now wearing sweat clothes, sits with her arms
      crossed -- waiting. The door opens and Smith enters.

                            SMITH
                I'm home!

      He see's Samantha sitting there. He smiles.

                          SMITH (CONT'D) (CONT'D)
                Man, that was a long day -- the
                crew went into double overtime.

                          SAMANTHA
                You are three hours late.

                          SMITH
                Bummer. I know. Did you eat?

                          SAMANTHA
                Yes, I ate. I ate the sushi that I
                hand made for you. The sushi that I
                planned to lay all over my naked
                body as a Valentines surprise for
                you.

                          SMITH
                Why are you so upset? I called.

                          SAMANTHA
                I slaved away in a kitchen all day
                to make this meal for you.

                                                     120.


                           SMITH
                 You made some sushi -- it's not a
                 big deal!

                           SAMANTHA
                 Not a big deal?

       She stands up. She picks up some pieces of sushi.

                           SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                 You see this -- This took me five
                 fucking hours!

       She throws sushi at him. He dodges them.

                            SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                 I am not the type of woman who sits
                 home all day waiting for a man!
                     (beat)
                 You love California so much --
                 enjoy your hand-made California
                 roll!

       She throws more sushi and storms out. Smith looks at the
       subzero fridge. A sushi piece slides down the front.

196B   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                   196B

       A FLORAL ARRANGEMENT sits on the hall table next to the
       answering machine. A card reading: "I'm sorry -- Miranda" is
       nearby. The answering machine is recording an incoming call
       from Miranda.

                           MIRANDA (V.O)
                 It's me. Pick up. Are you there?

       Carrie is standing in the bathroom; looking out at the
       answering machine, brushing her teeth.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 Three days of "I'm sorry" calls and
                 e-mails and flowers -- and I still
                 wasn't ready. It was the longest
                 we'd even gone without speaking.

                                                   120A.


196C   EXT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                  196C

       Rain. Carrie walks up to her stoop. A CAB idling in front.
       The cab window goes down. Miranda is sitting there.

                              MIRANDA
                 Carrie.

       Carrie looks. Stops.

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                 Hi. I need to talk to you.

                           CARRIE
                 How long have you been waiting
                 here?

       Miranda looks to the meter, then back to her.

                            MIRANDA
                 Seventeen dollars long.
                     (beat)
                 Please get in. It just turned to
                 eighteen.

       Carrie looks at her, hesitates, starts over to the cab.


196D   INT. CAB -- A LITTLE LATER                                196D

       Rain pours down the windows. Carrie and Miranda sit in
       silence. A MIDDLE EASTERN DRIVER sits behind the wheel.
       CLOSE ON: THE METER. It reads 22.00.

                                             121.



          This is weird not talking.

                       CARRIE
          I'm upset.

                      MIRANDA
          Carrie, I understand -- but it just
          happened -- I never meant to hurt
          you.
               (beat)
          You have to forgive me.

Carrie looks over at her.

                    CARRIE
          You know --

                                                     122.


                           MIRANDA
                 What?

                           CARRIE
                 No.

                           MIRANDA
                 Please. What were you going to say?

                           CARRIE
                 You badger me to forgive you in
                 three days -- and you won't even
                 consider forgiving Steve for
                 something he did six months ago.

                           MIRANDA
                 It's not the same thing.

                           CARRIE
                 It's forgiveness.

       Miranda thinks -- Carrie looks at her.

                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                 And -- I know you're not the reason
                 my marriage fell apart. I was just
                 - desperate to have someone else to
                 blame.

       Miranda thinks. The METER clicks.

201    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE -- DAY -- WINTER                   201

       Steve and Miranda are sitting in front of a THERAPIST.

                           MIRANDA
                 I don't know if I can trust that it
                 won't happen again.

                                           122A.


                   THERAPIST
         Steve - you're very quiet today.

                   STEVE
         Miranda, I know I made it hard for
         you to trust me. But -- You made it
         hard for me to trust you.

                   MIRANDA
         Me?!

                                                   123.


                           STEVE
                 The way you treated me and cut me
                 out of your life like that? I mean,
                 yeah -- I broke a vow. But what
                 about the other vows? Like
                 promising to love someone for
                 better or for worse? What about
                 that?

      Miranda looks down at her hands. Steve looks at the
      therapist.

                           STEVE (CONT'D)
                 How do I know she won't punish me
                 for the rest of my life?

                            THERAPIST
                 You don't. And she doesn't know for
                 sure that you won't have another
                 indiscretion.
                     (beat)
                 All you can know... is that you
                 want to move forward and risk that
                 you love for each other won't allow
                 that to happen.

      Silence.

                           THERAPIST (CONT'D)
                 And that's what we'll discover
                 here.

      Steve looks over at Miranda. Miranda looks at Steve.


202   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY -- SPRING                        202

      Forsythia bushes are in bloom. Carrie and Miranda walk. They
      carry sandwiches.

                           MIRANDA
                 So, we're done with our last
                 session and we're not allowed to
                 talk for two weeks while we figure
                 out if being together again is
                 something we really want. And then -
                 - we had to pick a place to meet --
                 and if we both show up on that day -
                 - the past no longer exists.
                 Showing up is the promise we make
                 to each other that we're willing to
                 let it all go and move forward.

                                           124.


                  CARRIE
        Can you do that?

                  MIRANDA
        I don't know. I have a lot of
        thinking to do.

                  CARRIE
        Thinking -- or feeling?

                  MIRANDA
        What do you mean?

                  CARRIE
        Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can
        argue both sides of any case --
        but, why we feel what we feel --
        isn't logical. It's emotional.
        Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're
        going to have to make this decision
        based on your emotions.

                  MIRANDA
        Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't
        know what I feel.

                  CARRIE
        You will. There will come a moment
        when you'll know. And if it's: yes -
        - all that brilliant logic will go
        out the window... with the past.

                  MIRANDA
        And I thought picking the place to
        meet was a challenge.

                  CARRIE
        Where is it?

                  MIRANDA
        The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway
        between both our places.

                  CARRIE
        Very logical. And yet poetic.

                  MIRANDA
        Poetic -- if we both show up.
        Otherwise -- you're on a bridge --
        rejected. Not a good plan.

                                                      125.


203    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  203

       Carrie walks in carrying a Starbucks cardboard caddy with two
       coffee. Louise is sitting at her desk, working.

                           LOUISE
                 I have two pieces of good news.

                           CARRIE
                 And I have two coffees.

                           LOUISE
                 I just got a heads-up from your
                 realtor. The apartment on Fifth
                 finally sold.

       Carrie sips coffee. Nods.

                           LOUISE (CONT'D)
                 You have sixty days before the new
                 owner takes possession and you are
                 out of there.

                           CARRIE
                 What's the other news?

       Louise holds up her hand. There is a diamond ring on it.

                           CARRIE (CONT'D)
                 Oh my God --

                           LOUISE
                 I'm moving back to St. Louis -- we
                 are getting married in the fall.

       Louise beams. Carrie hugs her.


204    EXT. BEACH -- DAY -- SPRING                                 204

       Grey day. Samantha is sitting on the beach reading "The
       Secret."

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles...

       She rolls her eyes, and tosses it down in the sand.


204A   EXT. BEACH -- A LITTLE LATER                               204A

       Samantha walks on the beach. The dog is walking with her.

                                            125A.


                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          ... Samantha had money, a career
          and a man who loved her... Still,
          she couldn't shake the feeling that
          something was missing from her
          life.

The dog runs up onto the neighbor's deck.

                                                     126.


                          SAMANTHA
                No! Come back here.


205   EXT. NEIGHBORS'S DECK -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING            205

      Samantha is on the neighbor's deck looking for the dog.

                          SAMANTHA
                Where are you, baby?

      She rounds a corner -- and comes face to face with Dante --
      showering in the outdoor shower. Water runs over his NAKED
      and PERFECT BODY. He sees her and smiles a hot smile. She is
      thrown -- overwhelmed.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                Sorry -- I'm your neighbor and my
                dog ran up on your dick--
                    (catching herself)
                --Deck!

      There is a GROWL sound. She looks -- the dog is humping a
      towel on the deck floor. She looks back at Dante.

                          DANTE
                Want to join me?

      Speechless -- She shakes her head: No -- she scoops up the
      dog and hurries away. He calls after her.

                             DANTE (CONT'D)
                I'm Dante.     Stop by -- anytime.

      Samantha takes a peek back and continues on her way.


206   EXT. BEACHOUSE/BEDROOM -- DAY -- SPRING                     206

      Samantha is having lunch outside while on the phone.

                          SAMANTHA
                Smith is interested - but the dates
                will have to work with the series.

      Dante appears on the deck next store in a wet suit. He unzips
      it while looking at Samantha. SAMANTHA dips a chip in
      guacamole and eats it. He pulls his wet-suit down and smiles
      at her. She dips another chip. He steps out of it and looks
      at her -- almost torturing her. She looks the other way, dips
      another chip in guacamole and eats it. Then another.

                                                   127.


207   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- DAY -- SPRING                     207

      Samantha is in the kitchen on the phone. She picks up a slice
      of messy pizza from a delivery box on the table.

                           SAMANTHA
                We agreed that no one else from the
                show but Smith was going to be on
                the cover.

      She walks to the window and looks out. Dante is on his deck
      putting on sun screen. He glistens. She chews.


208   INT. BEACHOUSE/DECK -- NIGHT -- SPRING                      208

      Samantha is in the jacuzzi -- she is looking up at Dante who
      is on his deck smoking a joint. He indicates for her to come
      over. She shakes her head: No. He walks away. She presses a
      button on the control panel. The jacuzzi jets start. She re-
      positions herself "on" them, then... She reaches over and
      grabs a giant hot fudge sundae and... starts eating it.


209   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            209

      Miranda sits in the window -- having a cappuccino, alone. On
      the table a legal pad with a list of PROS and CONS.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                With her two weeks just about up,
                Miranda's list of pros and cons
                were equal.

      She throws some money down on the table and takes a final sip
      on her cappuccino. As she stands up, she catches sight of
      herself in the mirrored wall. Cappuccino foam covers her top
      lip. She remembers. She knows.


210   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- LATER THAT DAY                      210

      Miranda stands on the bridge. Alone. She looks at her watch.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                It suddenly dawned on Miranda that
                Steve's list might have had more
                cons then pros.

      Just as this reality hits -- the CROWD parts and Steve is
      seen RUNNING up the bridge... towards her.

                                                  127A.


211   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER                       211

      Miranda and Steve walk along the bridge towards Brooklyn.

                                                     128.


                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And Miranda never looked back...


212   INT. STEVE AND MIRANDA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT -- SPRING           212

      Steve and Miranda are making love -- it is passionate.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                Well, almost never.

      Miranda turns her head back to look at Steve.

                           MIRANDA
                Kiss me.


213   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SPRING                    213

      Carrie's apartment is transformed. It is sleeker, polished,
      more grown-up, with a warm, modern feel.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And at home -- everything felt and
                looked different -- and yet still
                very much me.

      Carrie -- BLONDE again -- walks out of the kitchen with
      Lilacs in a large vase. The door bell buzzes.


214   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING          214

      Carrie opens the door. Miranda stands there with a very
      pregnant Charlotte.

                          CARRIE
                Sorry. This is a very exclusive
                party.

                          MIRANDA
                We're on the list. Miranda Hobbes
                plus one...and a half.


215   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  215

      WOMEN FRIENDS chatting and having fun. The front door is open
      and a coat rack is visible in the hall. A couple of WAITERS
      (20's) move around. ANTHONY comes up to Carrie.

                                             129.


                    ANTHONY
          A woman just put a glass down on
          your new desk without a coaster. I
          told her if she did it again I'd
          break her arm.

                      CARRIE
          Thanks.

He walks on. Miranda wanders up to Carrie.

                    MIRANDA
          Where's Samantha? Her plane landed
          two hours ago.

                    CARRIE
          You know her, probably ran to the
          hotel gym for a quick work-out.

Samantha appears in the doorway wearing a summer coat -- the
dog is in her purse.

                    SAMANTHA
          There's no place like home.

                      CARRIE
          Sweetie!

They kiss -- She goes to Miranda; they kiss.

                    MIRANDA
          There's a rat in your purse.

                    CARRIE
          And that rat better be house
          trained.

A CATER WAITER walks over to her.

                    CATER WAITER
          Can I take your coat?

Samantha nods and takes off her coat. Revealing: She has a
belly. A very non-Samantha big fat gut.

Carrie looks at it. Miranda looks at it. Carrie and Miranda
exchange looks. Charlotte comes running down the hall.

                      CHARLOTTE
          Samantha!

Samantha raises her arms to greet her. Her blouse rides up,
the gut peeks out. Charlotte reacts; shocked.

                                                   130.


                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                You have a -- dog!

                          SAMANTHA
                Did you ever think you'd see the
                day -- me with a pooch.

      All three shake their heads: No.


216   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM -- LATER -- SPRING       216

      Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte are in the bathroom.

                          MIRANDA
                So, she has a belly. So what?

                          CARRIE
                No, a belly on anyone else is a "so
                what?" A belly on Samantha is a:
                "So what the hell is going on?"

                          CHARLOTTE
                She never mentioned it on the
                phone?

                          CARRIE
                Never. And when has she ever not
                talked about every detail regarding
                her body?

                          CHARLOTTE
                Should we even bring it up?

                          MIRANDA
                What -- like a fat intervention?
                "We love you -- have a salad?" No.
                We should let her bring it up.

      There is a knock... Samantha opens the door. She's eating a
      piece of cake.

                          SAMANTHA
                Ladies, we can talk about my gut
                later-- right now, I'm bored to
                tears here.

      She gives them a look. They smile, relieved.

                                                   131.


217   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  217

      Everyone has left. Samantha is sitting with Charlotte and
      Miranda and Carrie. They are having coffee.

                          SAMANTHA
                I eat -- so I won't cheat.

                          MIRANDA
                What exactly are you eating?

                          SAMANTHA
                Everything except Dante's dick.

                          CARRIE
                Language, please -- this is a grown-
                up apartment now.

                          SAMANTHA
                I guess I didn't realize how big I
                was until I saw it on your faces.

                          CARRIE
                How -- and I say this with love --
                How could you not realize it?

                          SAMANTHA
                I've been avoiding mirrors.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I'm proud of you for not cheating.

                          SAMANTHA
                I don't know if there's anything to
                be proud of. I stuff my face to
                stop myself from doing something
                that feels natural to me.

      Carrie reaches over and rubs Samantha's back.

                          CARRIE
                Why didn't you say something?

                          SAMANTHA
                I guess I didn't want to admit it.
                And when you're in denial -- you
                don't dial.

                          CARRIE
                Now, listen -- this isn't about the
                weight. You'd be gorgeous at any
                size. But are you happy?

                                             132.


                     SAMANTHA
              (Silence; then)
          Relationships aren't always about
          being happy, right?
              (beat)
          How often do you feel happy in your
          relationship?

                    CARRIE
              (to Charlotte)
          I'm pretty sure that's to you.

                       CHARLOTTE
          Every day.

                    SAMANTHA
          You feel happy ever day?

                    CHARLOTTE
          Not all day -- everyday -- but
          everyday.

                    MIRANDA
          When was the last time you felt
          happy?

                    SAMANTHA
          Six months ago.

They react.

                    SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
          What am I going to do?

                    CARRIE
          What does your gut tell you?

                    SAMANTHA
          I know but --
              (beat; hard)
          Smith stayed with me through chemo.
          If he could stay with me through
          that, I should be able to stay in
          this relationship for him.

                    CARRIE
          Sweetie... You just compared your
          relationship to chemo.

Samantha looks at her, then Charlotte, then Miranda.

                                                    133.


                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                There we were...the three mirrors
                Samantha couldn't avoid.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                And Samantha?

      Samantha looks. Carrie points. The dog is humping a pillow on
      Carrie's furniture.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                That pillow cost three hundred
                dollars.


218   INT. BEACHHOUSE -- DINING ROOM/SUNSET -- SPRING            218

      Samantha is sitting -- waiting. Smith enters.

                          SMITH
                Hey -- You're home! I thought you
                were staying the week.

      He kisses her. She looks at him. Touches his face.

                          SAMANTHA
                We need to talk.

                          SMITH
                Awwww... man. I knew this was
                coming.

                           SAMANTHA
                Yeah. This isn't working.
                    (beat)
                I've done my best. I've given it
                five years and fifteen pounds.

                          SMITH
                What -- You don't love me any more?

                          SAMANTHA
                Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it --
                I'm just gonna say the thing you're
                not supposed to say -- I love you
                but I love me more. And I've been
                in a relationship with myself for
                forty-nine years and that's the one
                I need to work on.

      She stands up and wraps her arms around him, whispers.

                                                   134.


                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                You'll find a wonderful woman who
                loves being in a relationship.

                          SMITH
                What will you find?

                          SAMANTHA
                I don't know. But that's a risk I'm
                willing to take.

      She notices the gardenia ring on her finger. She starts to
      take it off. Stops. Looks back up at him.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                No. I'm keeping this. Every time I
                look down at it I want to think of
                you.

      She kisses him on the lips. GENTLY. SOFTLY.


219   INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT -- SPRING              219

      Samantha sits in first class. She is crying... while eating a
      hot fudge sundae. A STEWARDESS leans down.

                          STEWARDESS
                We're landing in new York. I'm
                gonna need to take that now.

      Samantha nods, and finishes eating the hot fudge sundae as
      fast as she can. Scraping, almost licking the bowl.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                As someone returned to my life...


220   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- SPRING                  220

      Carrie stands at the door with Louise.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                ... Someone left.

                          LOUISE
                And I put all the unopened mail
                from your P.O. Box in the manila
                envelopes on the bottom shelf
                there.

      She points to the shelf in the new bookcase. Carrie looks.

                                               135.


                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          And please -- please do not make a
          mess of CarrieBradshaw.com -- it's
          my masterpiece.

                    CARRIE
          What am I gonna do without you?

                    LOUISE
          You'll find some other girl... but
          she won't have my style.

                    CARRIE
          St. Louise, you brought me back to
          life.

Emotion floods Carrie; she chokes up. So does Louise --

                    LOUISE
          And you gave me Louise Vuitton.

Carrie laughs -- they hug.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          Serious. We need to stop cryin'.

Louise breaks the hug and takes her "love" key chain out of
her purse -- hands it to Carrie.

                       LOUISE (CONT'D)
          Your keys.

                    CARRIE
          Wait -- don't forget your "love."

                    LOUISE
          No, I found my love. I'm leaving
          that with you.

Carrie smiles. Louise starts out the door, turns back.

                    LOUISE (CONT'D)
          See you at my wedding.

                    CARRIE
          I'll meet you in St. Louis.

Louise gives one last look, and leaves. Carrie closes the
door. Looks down at "love" in her hand.

                                                   136.


221   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT -- SPRING                  221

      Carrie is sitting at her desk... typing.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                Now, there were no more
                distractions.
                    (beat)
                And as I moved on...


222   EXT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY -- SPRING          222

      Samantha walks past Lovro and Magda sitting on chairs out
      front, sipping ice tea, and up to Miranda's lower east side
      apartment stoop with the dog on the leash.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                ... Samantha moved in.

      The HOT TATTOOED LATIN GUY is still sitting on the stoop out
      front with the ferocious looking pitbull. She starts up the
      stairs. He checks her out. She turns.

                          SAMANTHA
                Hi, I'm your new neighbor.

                             HOT NEIGHBOR
                Diego.

                             SAMANTHA
                Samantha.

      They smile. There is a connection. Samantha looks down. The
      dog is humping the pitbull. Diego nods approval.


223   EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            223

      A very, very pregnant Charlotte carrying shopping bags is
      being seated at a banquette by the HOSTESS (26).

                          HOSTESS
                When are you due?

                             CHARLOTTE
                Next week.

                          HOSTESS
                You look gorgeous.

                                                     137.


                          CHARLOTTE
                    (touched; embarrassed)
                Oh, thank-you.

      The Hostess walks away as Charlotte settles in and looks
      around. Her eyes WIDEN. Big is sitting across the room at a
      table -- alone. He hasn't seen her. Charlotte starts to panic
      as the WAITRESS (20's) comes over.

                          WAITRESS
                Hi, can I --

                          CHARLOTTE
                No, I'm sorry -- I can't stay --
                Help me -- pull out the table. I
                can't --

      Charlotte pulls herself up off the banquette. As she tries to
      slide out, her belly and shopping bags knock things off the
      table. Crash. DINERS looks. Big spots her -- their eyes meet.
      She moves away as quickly as she can through the room. He
      gets up and follows after her.


224   EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            224

      Charlotte exits the restaurant -- visibly upset. Big is
      quickly on her heels.

                          BIG
                Charlotte. Charlotte wait --

      He catches up to her - and gently steps to her.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                You're pregnant -- don't run.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I don't want to see you.

      She starts crying and talking though the tears.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                I'm so mad at you. I was always on
                your side and then you did that to
                Carrie -- No, no -- I'm not going
                to cry -- I'm not going to waste
                tears on you --
                    (strong; stomping foot)
                I curse the day you were born!

      Charlotte's eyes widen. She stops moving, entirely.

                                                   138.


                           CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                I think my water just broke.
                    (beat)
                Oh my God -- Taxi!

                          BIG
                My car's right there. Get in my
                car.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I don't want to get in your car --
                I hate your car. Taxi!

                          BIG
                Charlotte -- we need to get you to
                the hospital -- Please get in my
                car. It's right here and ready.

      Charlotte finally nods. Big hurries her to the car.


225   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- LATER                             225

      Carrie hurries down a corridor -- looking for a room. She
      spots it, knocks and enters.


226   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                            226

      Carrie enters. Harry stands there. Beaming.

                          CARRIE
                Hi. Congratulations... A girl!

                          HARRY
                It's my lot in life to be
                surrounded by beautiful women.

      She kisses him and walks over to the bed where Charlotte is
      holding ROSE, a beautiful baby with thick dark hair.

                          CARRIE
                Oh my God. She's gorgeous.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Say hello to Rose.

      Carrie kisses Charlotte on the head.

                          CARRIE
                What a beautiful name.

                                             139.


                    CHARLOTTE
          After Harry's "Bubbie."

                    HARRY
          Now, we got a Lily and a Rose.

Carrie sits on the edge of the bed.

                    CARRIE
          Well, I have to say you two are
          very cool customers -- just making
          the "baby's here" call without all
          the "I'm in labor" drama.

                    HARRY
          Oh -- there was plenty of drama.

                    CHARLOTTE
          My water broke in front of a
          restaurant.

                    CARRIE
          Very dramatic.

                    HARRY
          Wait -- she's not done.

                    CHARLOTTE
          It broke while I was talking to
          Big.

                    CARRIE
          What?

                    HARRY
          See. Drama.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I bumped into him and I got so
          upset I started crying and then -
          my water broke.

                    HARRY
          He brought her to the hospital.
          Stayed until the baby was born.

                    CHARLOTTE
          I think he was hoping to see you.

Silence. Carrie is having a hard time with this.

                                                   140.


                          CARRIE
                Well -- today is not about him.
                It's about beautiful baby Rose.
                    (beat; forced up)
                So -- we know she has Charlotte's
                hair -- what else do we know?

      Harry and Charlotte give each other a sad glance.


227   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- LATER                           227

      Carrie walks out of Charlotte's room with Harry.

                          CARRIE
                She's a doll. Mazel tov!

      She kisses Harry on the cheek and starts away.

                          HARRY
                He asked me to ask you to call him.

      Carrie stops. Turns around. Looks at him.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                I know! It's none of my business.
                But I felt bad for the poor schmuck
                hanging around the hospital waiting
                room hoping to see you. I swear
                every time he heard someone in
                heels coming down the hall -- his
                heart stopped.

                          CARRIE
                Harry -- it's so much more
                complicated than you can imagine.

                          HARRY
                I know it is -- and you have every
                right to never call him -- but I'm
                just a big pile of love today --and
                I feel bad for the guy. He said
                he's been writing you -- but you
                never responded.

                          CARRIE
                    (beat; then)
                He's never written me.

                          HARRY
                He said he wrote because he didn't
                have your phone number.

                                                   141.


                          CARRIE
                No. He's never written me. Ever.

                          HARRY
                Then, why would he say that he had?

      Carrie looks at Harry. Lost. Confused.


228   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  228

      Carrie enters her apartment. She glances over at her bookcase
      -- Remembers.

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie opens the bookcase drawer and takes out a
      Manila envelope marked: P.O. Box.

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie dumps the contents of the envelopes on
      the desk.

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie quickly sorts through the mail -- looking
      -- looking for something. A letter -- something. Nothing from
      him. She leans back in her chair -- more confused. Her eyes
      drift up to her computer. She wonders if --

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie is logging onto CarrieBradshaw.com. She
      types in PASSWORD.

      JUMP CUT TO: CarrieBradshaw.com's "welcome page." She clicks
      on EMAIL.

      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie scans through emails -- none are from
      Big. Frustrated she logs off.


229   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER                            229

      Carrie is still at her desk, lost in thought.

                          CARRIE (VO)
                Two hours, two manila envelopes and
                countless emails later, I was just
                about to give up on the Big riddle
                when --

      She looks back at her computer screen and notices:

      "CB-assistant." Carrie sits up. Clicks on it.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I had told Louise to put Big in a
                place where I would never have to
                hear from him again.

                                               142.


She types in her password. Nothing. Picks up her phone. Dials
a number.

                    CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Hey, Louise -- it's me. What's the
          password to get into your assistant
          file? Call me.

She hangs up and places the phone on a pile of mail -- which
causes the mail to fall over onto the floor.

                       CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Shit.

Carrie reaches down to pick-up the mail -- she notices the
"LOVE" key chain has fallen as well. She picks it up and
looks at it, has a hunch.

                       CARRIE (CONT'D)
          Oh my God.

JUMP CUT TO: Carrie types the password: "L-O-V-E." Yes! The
file opens -- her eyes widen. There on the screen are many,
many, many emails -- all from JJP@JJP.com.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          As soon as I typed in "love" --
          there he was.

She clicks on the first e-mail. It opens:

It's the love letter from Beethoven, retyped.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And because Big still didn't have
          the words... he retyped a love
          letter from Beethoven.

JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A love letter from Lord Byron.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And Lord Byron.

JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A love letter from James Joyce.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And James Joyce.

JUMP CUT TO: New Email: A Love letter from Voltaire.

                    CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And Voltaire.

                                                   143.


      JUMP CUT TO: Carrie sits in the chair. Breathless.
      Overwhelmed.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                There they were. "The Love Letters
                of Great Men - Volume One." Plus
                one more... Written by John James
                Preston.

      New email -- It reads: "I know I screwed it up -- but I will
      love you forever."

      Carrie impulsively picks up the phone -- starts to dial.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                I wanted to call him - but our
                love... Carrie and Big: volumes
                one, two, and three... stopped me.

      She puts the phone down and is about to "delete" the e mail --
      suddenly; the phone rings.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Hello.

                          LOUISE (O.C.)
                I didn't hear my phone.


230   INT. BRIDAL SHOP -- CONTINUOUS -- SPRING                   230

      Intercut with Louise, standing in a wedding gown. Her MOTHER
      (45), GRANDMOTHER (65), and SISTERS (20 15, 8) sit watching.

                          LOUISE
                We are shopping for my wedding
                gown.

      ANGELA, her youngest sister calls out.

                          ANGELA
                That one makes you look weird.

                          LOUISE
                    (calls over)
                Momma -- can you please -- This is
                a work call.

      The Mother motions for Angela to sit down. She does.

                          CARRIE
                No, it's okay I figured it out.

                                                     144.


                           LOUISE
                Well, I was going to call you
                anyway -- today is the final day on
                the Fifth Avenue apartment. You
                have till six before they change
                the locks.

                          CARRIE
                I don't need to go over there.

                          LOUISE
                And do you NOT want those never-
                worn shoes?

                          CARRIE
                Oh -- I completely forgot about --

                          LOUISE
                `Cause if you don't -- send them on
                to me. I'll squeeze my feet into
                them.

                          CARRIE
                It's already five o'clock.

                          LOUISE
                Hello? There are never been worn
                four hundred dollar shoes!

                           CARRIE
                Five twenty-five.
                     (beat; hears herself)
                Bye.

      Carrie drops the phone and jumps up.


231   EXT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING          231

      Carrie runs down the stairs... she spots a passing CAB.

                          CARRIE
                Taxi!

      It SCREECHES to a halt. She runs to the cab.


232   INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING                    232

      Carrie steps into the elevator. She presses "PH," steps back.
      The doors close.

                                                   145.


233   INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER -- SPRING         233

      Key in the lock -- Carrie enters. She looks around.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                The light in our pre-war apartment
                looked completely different post-
                war.


234   INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER   -- SPRING
                                                                234

      Carrie walks into the bedroom and over to the closet. She
      pushes open the other double door... Revealing --

      Mr. Big - standing there holding the Manolos in his hands. He
      looks up -- surprised by her.

                          BIG
                I was going to get these to you. I
                didn't want it to be a total loss.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                It wasn't logic -- it was love.

      She walks into the closet and over to him. She throws her
      arms around him. He drops the shoes. They kiss. It's
      passionate. Very -- very passionate.


235   INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT/WALK-IN CLOSET -- LATER -- SPRING 35
                                                               2

      Carrie and Big are nestled up next to each other on the
      carpeted floor of the empty walk-in closet. His suit jacket
      is off. Her shoes are off.

                          CARRIE
                Why did we ever decide to get
                married?

                          BIG
                    (beat; then)
                I guess we were afraid it meant
                something if we didn't.

      She looks at him and nods. It's true.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                I'm sorry to have done that to you.

      Silence. She touches his lips.

                                               146.


                     CARRIE
          I'm sorry to have done that to
          you...
              (beat)
          And you know the funny part?

                    BIG
          Is there a funny part?

                    CARRIE
          We were perfectly happy before we
          decided to live happily ever after.

                    BIG
          Yep. The jokes on us.

She nods... she looks around.

                    CARRIE
          Good closet.

                     BIG
          Thanks.

                    CARRIE
          Comfortable. Is this what you had
          in mind when you installed the
          carpet?

                    BIG
          I'd like to think I was that
          smooth.

                    CARRIE
          We better get up before the new
          owner bust in on us.

They start to get up. Carrie rises first. He starts to get
up, first -- sitting on his side...

                    BIG
          And the way we decided to get
          married -- All business... No
          romance. That's not the way you
          propose to someone.

He moves further up -- onto one knee -- where he stops.

                     BIG (CONT'D)
          This is.

She looks down at him -- Is this happening? He holds out his
hand. She places her hand in his.

                                                   147.


                          BIG (CONT'D)
                Carrie Bradshaw -- love of my life -
                - will you marry me?

      It is everything Carrie Bradshaw had convinced herself would
      never happen. Could never happen. And here it is.

      She nods. Speechless. Overcome. He smiles.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                See, this is why there's a diamond.
                You need to do something to close
                the deal.

      She laughs. He notices her never-worn Manolo on the floor. He
      picks it up. Holds it out to her. She lifts her foot and
      places it in the shoe. Cinderella style.


236   INT. COURTHOUSE/ROOM -- DAY -- SPRING                     236

      Carrie stands with Big in front of a JUDGE. She is wearing
      the simple white suit and her never-worn Manolos from the
      closet.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And in the end... Carrie Bradshaw
                married John James Preston in a
                label-less dress.

      Big Smiles. She smiles. Both calm. Sure.

                           JUDGE
                By the power vested in me, by the
                state of New York, I now pronounce
                you husband and wife. You may kiss
                the bride.

      Big and Carrie kiss. Then, he whispers into her ear.

                          BIG
                Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours.


237   INT. COURTHOUSE/LOBBY -- LATER                            237

      Carrie and Big walk through the courthouse lobby toward the
      front door holding hands.

                          BIG
                You okay that it was just us?

                          CARRIE
                Perfect. You and me -- like I said.

                                                     148.


                          BIG
                Still. Would have been nice if you
                had the girls here.

      He holds the door open for her as they walk outside.


238   EXT. COURTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS -- SPRING                     238

      Carrie and Big walk out of the courthouse into the sun.

                          BIG
                Which is why I called them.

      Carrie looks. Miranda, Charlotte, and a MORE SLENDER Samantha
      are standing there. They SCREAM and throw rice.

                          MIRANDA/SAMANTHA
                Congratulations!

                             CHARLOTTE
                Mazel tov!

      As the rice hits... Carrie screams and Big laughs. A GUARD
      hurries over to them. Carrie is spitting out rice.

                          GUARD
                Excuse me -- excuse me! You're not
                allowed to throw rice anymore.

                          SAMANTHA
                Honey, get over it -- It's New
                York!

      She winks at the guard. He shrugs and walks away.


239   INT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- SPRING                         239

      Big, Carrie, Miranda, Steve, Brady, Charlotte, Harry, Lily,
      rose, Stanford, Samantha are casually gathered around a
      couple of tables that have been pushed together. A WAITRESS
      comes over balancing hot plates.

                          WAITRESS
                Who had the ham and eggs?

      Big raises his arm. The waitress hands the plate down...
      Carrie intercepts it and places it in front of Big.

                                                      149.


                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 It wasn't a fancy designer
                 reception either. Just food and
                 friends.

       The Waitress hands out the other breakfasts. People LAUGH.
       Samantha feeds bacon to the dog -- who is wearing a tiny
       bridal veil on his head.


239A   INT. BARNES AND NOBLE -- DAY -- SUMMER                     239A

       Carrie's books are displayed on a BOOK KIOSK. Carrie stands
       in front of it READING to a crowd from the galleys of her new
       book. She is wearing READING GLASSES.

                           CARRIE
                 Maybe some labels are best left in
                 the closet...


240    EXT. VITRA -- NIGHT -- SUMMER                               240

       Bustling. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha -- back to
       her fighting weight -- walk down the busy street dressed for
       a night on the town. They laugh as they go -- their designer
       purses swinging.

                           CARRIE (V.O.)
                 ... Maybe when we put a label on
                 people... bride, groom, husband,
                 wife, fat, thin, married, single...
                 we forget to look past the label
                 and see the person.

       They arrive at the club entrance. A line of PEOPLE wait to be
       let inside. The DOORMAN (30's) spots Carrie, lifts the red
       rope and lets the girls in -- closing it after them.


241    INT. RESTAURANT -- LATER -- SUMMER                          241

       The four girls sit at a table drinking "Cosmopolitans."

                           CHARLOTTE
                 Hmmm. This is delicious.

                           MIRANDA
                 Why did we ever stop drinking
                 these?

                           CARRIE
                 Because everyone else started.

                                            149A.


                    SAMANTHA
              (sips; then)
          Well, that is an oldie but goodie.

                    CARRIE
          And speaking of an oldie but
          goodie...

A WAITER brings birthday cake to the table. The number: "50"
stands proud and tall among the glowing candles. He places it
down in front of a proud Samantha.

                                                     150.


                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                Wait -- wait -- a toast.

      The girls lift their glasses to Samantha.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                To Samantha... fifty and fabulous!

      Samantha smiles, touched -- then blows out her candles.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                To us... and the next fifty!

      Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha raise their glasses.

                          ALL
                To the next fifty.

      They sip and look at one another.

                          CARRIE (V.O.)
                And there, in the same city where
                they met as girls, four New York
                women entered the next phase of
                their lives... dressed head to toe
                in love.

      Samantha licks some icing. Charlotte cuts the cake. Miranda
      helps. Carrie smiles and sips.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And that's the one label -- that
                never goes out of style.


242   EXT. VITRA -- CONTINUOUS                                    242

      From outside we catch just a glimpse of Carrie and the girls
      at their table inside the busy club. The CAMERA starts to
      move away -- passing the line of PEOPLE waiting to get in.
      At the front of the line four TWENTY-SOMETHING WOMEN stand
      waiting for the red rope to be lifted. As the CAMERA moves
      past them and UP -- the Doorman lifts the red rope and the
      twenty-something women SQUEAL with excitement and
      anticipation as they hurry inside. The CAMERA continues UP
      and UP and over the busy and exciting city.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.
SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE 


                     by Marc Norman & Tom Stoppard



       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

       SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears. 
       Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre 
       two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and 
       audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, 
       home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. 
       Across the river was the competition, built by Philip 
       Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...

       ...The Rose...

       Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three-
       tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, 
       roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It 
       says:

       SEPT. 7TH & 8TH AT NOON

       MR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE 
       THEATRE, BANKSIDE

       THE LAMENTABLE TRAGEDIE OF THE MONEYLENDER REVENG'D

       OVER THIS the screams of a man under torture. The screams 
       are coming from the curtained stage.

                           VOICE (O.S.)
                 You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it 
                 is I who am bitten?

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       The theatre owner, PHILLIP HENSLOWE, is the man 
       screaming. HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned 
       in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of 
       a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that 
       position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN, 
       who is the owner of the VOICE. The fourth man, FREES, is 
       FENNYMAN'S bookkeeper.

                           FENNYMAN
                 What am I, Mr. Lambert?

                           LAMBERT
                 Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

                           FENNYMAN
                 How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

                           FREES
                 Twelve pounds, one shilling and four 
                 pence, Mr. Fennyman, including 
                 interest.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Aaagh! I can pay you!

                           FENNYMAN
                 When?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! 
                 For pity's sake.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Take his feet out. Where will you get

                           FREES
                     (the mathematical genius with 
                      a notebook)
                 Sixteen pounds, five shillings and 
                 nine pence

                           FENNYMAN
                 including interest in three weeks?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I have a wonderful new play!

                           FENNYMAN
                 Put his feet in.

                           HENSLOWE
                 It's a comedy.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Cut his nose off.

                           HENSLOWE
                 A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!

                           FENNYMAN
                 And his ears.

                           HENSLOWE
                 And a share. We will be partners, Mr. 
                 Fennyman!

                           FENNYMAN
                     (hesitating)
                 Partners!

                           HENSLOWE
                 It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken 
                 identities, a shipwreck, a pirate 
                 king, a bit with a dog, and love 
                 triumphant.

                           LAMBERT
                 I think I've seen it. I didn't like 
                 it.

                           HENSLOWE
                 This time it is by Shakespeare.

                           FENNYMAN
                 What's the title?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Good title.

       FENNYMAN snaps his fingers at FREES and LAMBERT. LAMBERT 
       unties HENSLOWE, FREES starts writing a contract.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 A play takes time. Find actors 
                 rehearsalslet's say open in three 
                 weeks. That's--what--five hundred 
                 groundlings at tuppence each, in 
                 addition four hundred groundlings 
                 tuppence each, in addition four 
                 hundred backsides at three pence--a 
                 penny extra for a cushion, call it two 
                 hundred cushions, say two performance 
                 for safety how much is that Mr. Frees?

                           FREES
                 Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. 
                 Fennyman.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Correct!

                           HENSLOWE
                 But I have to pay the actors and the 
                 authors.

                           FENNYMAN
                 A share of the profits.

                           HENSLOWE
                 There's never any

                           FENNYMAN
                 Of course not!

                           HENSLOWE
                     (impressed)
                 Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit 
                 on something.

       FENNYMAN slaps a contract down on the table next to n ink-
       pot and quill.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Sign here.

       HENSLOWE takes the quill and signs.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's 
                 DaughterAlmost finished?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Without doubt he is completing it at 
                 this very moment.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY

       A small cramped space in the eaves of a building. A 
       cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged 
       between crumpled pieces of paper. Among those we have 
       time to observe: a skull, a mug that says A PRESENT FROM 
       STRATFORD-UPON-AVON. 

       At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper 
       are tossed towards the shelf. The man who is throwing 
       them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing 
       studiously with a quill. 

       Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his 
       signature, over and over again. "Will ShagsbeardW 
       ShakspurWilliam Shasper" Each time he is dissatisfied, 
       and each time he crumples, and tosses it away. 

       Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to 
       the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts 
       to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and 
       HENSLOWE walks in. He is out of breath and his feet hurt.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Will! Where is my play? Tell me you 
                 have it nearly done! Tell me you have 
                 it started.
                     (desperately)
                 You have begun?

                           WILL
                     (struggling with his boots)
                 Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt 
                 that the sun doth move

                           HENSLOWE
                 No, no, we haven't the time. Talk 
                 prose. Where is my play?

                           WILL
                     (tapping his forehead and 
                      heading out the door)
                 It is all locked safe in here

                           HENSLOWE
                 God be praised!
                     (then doubt)
                 Locked?

                           WILL
                 As soon as I have found my muse

       EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL lives in a crowded area of the city. Hawkers are 
       crying their wares, tract-sellers, delivery boys, and 
       merchants go about their business. HENSLOWE catches up 
       with WILL as he strides purposefully along.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (catching up)
                 Who is she this time?!

                           WILL
                 She is always Aphrodite.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind 
                 the Dog and Trumpet?

                           WILL
                 Henslowe, you have no soul so how can 
                 you understand the emptiness that 
                 seeks a soulmate?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Well, I am a dead man and buggered to 
                 boot. My theatre is close by the 
                 plague these twelve weeks, my company 
                 is playing the inn-yards
                 of England, while Burbage and the 
                 Chamberlain's Men are invited to court 
                 and receive ten pounds to play your 
                 piece, written for my theatre, by my 
                 writer, at my risk when you were green 
                 and grateful -

                           WILL
                 What piece? Richard Crookback?

                           HENSLOWE
                 No--it's comedy they want, Will! 
                 Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?

                           WILL
                 Who wrote that?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Nobody! You are writing it for me! I 
                 gave you three pounds a month since.

                           WILL
                 Half what you owed me. I am still due 
                 for One Gentleman of Verona.

       EXT. ANOTHER STREET. DAY

       HENSLOWE'S hardly paused in his appeal.

                           HENSLOWE
                 . . . Will! What is money to you and 
                 me? I, your patron, you my wordwright! 
                 When the plague lifts Burbage will 
                 have a new Christopher Marlowe for the 
                 Curtain and I have nothing for the 
                 Rose.

       WILL stops.

                           WILL
                 Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty 
                 pounds?

                           HENSLOWE
                     (staggered)
                 Fifty pounds? What for?

                           WILL
                 Burbage offers me a partnership in the 
                 Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my 
                 hired player days are over.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to 
                 the dogs!

                           WILL
                     (answering for him)
                 No, then.

       WILL turns down a side street.

       EXT. MARKETPLACE. DAY.

       HENSLOWE and WILL are crossing a crowded marketplace 
       where a Puritan preacher, MAKEPEACE, is haranguing anyone 
       who will listen.

                           MAKEPEACE
                 and the Lord shall smite them! Yea, 
                 harken to me. The theatres are 
                 handmaidens of the devil! Under the 
                 name of the Curtain, the players
                 breed lewdness in your wives, 
                 rebellion in your servants, idleness 
                 in your apprentices and wickedness in 
                 your children! And the Rose smells 
                 thusly rank by any name! I say a 
                 plague on both their houses!

       As he passes WILL gratefully makes a mental note.

       EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL turns into a narrow street and walks toward a 
       doorway.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Where are you going?

                           WILL
                 To my weekly confession.

       As HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign 
       identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH, 
       apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of 
       dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled.

       INT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY

       A stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling, pills, 
       potions, amulets and charms, star charts and mystic 
       paraphernalia festoon the place. Testimonials and framed 
       degrees hang on the walls. 

       WILL lying on a couch, on his back. His eyes are closed 

       DR. MOTH sits by the couch, listening to WILL and 
       occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee. 
       What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of 
       analysis. The session is being timed by an hourglass.

                           WILL
                 Words, words, wordsonce, I had the 
                 giftI could make love out of words as 
                 a potter makes cups out of clay love 
                 that overthrows empires, love that 
                 binds two hearts together come 
                 hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a 
                 line, I could cause a riot in a 
                 nunnerybut now

                           DR. MOTH
                 And yet you tell me you lie with 
                 women?

       WILL seems unwiling to respond. DR. MOTH refers to his 
       notes.

                           DR. MOTH (CONT'D)
                 Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, 
                 Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who 
                 does it behind the Dog and

                           WILL
                     (interrupting)
                 Aye, now and again, but what of it? I 
                 have lost my gift.

                           DR. MOTH
                 I am here to help you. Tell me in your 
                 own words.

                           WILL
                 I have lost my gift.
                     (not finding this easy)
                 It's as if my quill is broken. As if 
                 the organ of the imagination has dried 
                 up. As if the proud tower of my genius 
                 has collapsed.

                           DR. MOTH
                 Interesting.

                           WILL
                 Nothing comes.

                           DR. MOTH
                 Most interesting.

                           WILL
                 It is like trying to a pick a lock 
                 with a wet herring.

                           DR. MOTH
                     (shrewdly)
                 Tell me, are you lately humbled in the 
                 act of love?

       WILL turns towards him. How did he know that?

                           DR. MOTH (CONT'D)
                 How long has it been?

                           WILL
                 A goodly length in times past, but 
                 lately

                           DR. MOTH
                 No, no. You have a wife, children

       The sand runs through the hourglass.

                           LATER
                 Not much sand left.

                           WILL
                 I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway 
                 was a woman, half as old again.

                           DR. MOTH
                 A woman of property?

                           WILL
                     (shrugs)
                 She had a cottage. One day, she was 
                 three months gone with child, so

                           DR. MOTH
                 And your relations?

                           WILL
                 On my mother's side the Ardens

                           DR. MOTH
                 No, your marriage bed.

                           WILL
                 Four years and a hundred miles away in 
                 Stratford. 
                 A cold bed too, since the twins were 
                 born. Banishment was a blessing.

                           DR. MOTH
                 So now you are free to love

                           WILL
                 yet cannot love nor write it.

       DR. MOTH reaches for a glass snake bracelet.

                           DR. MOTH
                 Here is a bangle found in Psyche's 
                 temple on Olympus cheap at four pence. 
                 Write your name on a paper and feed it 
                 in the snake.

       WILL looks at the snake bangle in wonder.

                           WILL
                 Will it restore my gift?

                           DR. MOTH
                 The woman who wears the snake will 
                 dream of you, and your gift will 
                 return. Words will flow like a river. 
                 I will see you in a week.

       He holds out his hand. WILL drops a sovereign into it, 
       and takes the bracelet.

       EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL comes out. HENSLOWE is waiting, standing in a horse 
       trough to ease his feet. WILL walks straight past him, 
       and HENSLOWE follows.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Now where? Will?

                           WILL
                 To the Palace at Whitehall.

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       WHITEHALL means nothing yet. We are behind closed 
       curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the 
       imminent performance of Two Gentlemen of Verona. This is 
       not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see. 

       RICHARD BURBAGE is to play "PROTEUS." A BOY PLAYER will 
       play "SILVIA," and last minute improvements to his makeup 
       etc. are being applied by BURBAGE'S mistress ROSALINE. 
       "LAUNCE," one of the clowns, is the famous comedian WILL 
       KEMPE. "LAUNCE'S" dog, CRAB is in KEMPE'S charge and is 
       not helping much. There is no set. A helpful placard 
       reading VERONA--AN OPEN PLACE, is ready to hand. MUSICIANS 
       can be heard tuning their instruments. From the other 
       side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. KEMPE 
       leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of 
       proops. He finds a skull. He has one foot on the box, his 
       elbow on his knee, he looks at the skullin other words 
       he reminds us of Hamlet. We see this from the POV of 
       WILL, who is just entering through a door backstage.

                           WILL
                     (approaching)
                 Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You 
                 too, good Crab.

                           KEMPE
                 Crab is nervous. He has never played 
                 the Palace. When will you write me a 
                 tragedy, Will? I could do it.

                           WILL
                 No, they would laugh at Seneca if you 
                 played it.

       WILL'S attention has been caught by ROSALINE, BURBAGE'S 
       mistress. ROSALINE is big breasted, dark-eyed, dark-
       haired, sexual.

                           BURBAGE
                     (to ROSALINE)
                 My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress 
                 Rosaline, where were my seamstress's 
                 eyes?

       BURBAGE kisses her mouth and slaps her behind. He comes 
       over to greet WILL.

                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                 There is no dog in the first scene, 
                 Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it 
                 Will?

                           WILL
                 I am still owed money for this play, 
                 Burbage.

                           BURBAGE
                 Not from me. I only stole it. When are 
                 you coming over to the Chamberlain's 
                 Men?

                           WILL
                 When I have fifty pounds.

       ROSALINE brings over the last elements of BURBAGE'S 
       costume and helps him into them.

                           BURBAGE
                 Are you writing?

                           WILL
                     (nods somewhat defensively)
                 A comedy. All but done, a pirate 
                 comedy, wonderful.

                           BURBAGE
                 What is the chief part?

                           WILL
                 Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.

                           BURBAGE
                 The title?

                           WILL
                 Romeo

                           BURBAGE
                 I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.

                           WILL
                 It's for Henslowe. He paid me.

                           BURBAGE
                 How much?

                           WILL
                 Ten pounds.

                           BURBAGE
                 You're a liar.

       BURBAGE digs under his costume for his purse, which is on 
       a waistband, over his corset.

                           WILL
                 I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and 
                 the Admiral's Men.

                           BURBAGE
                 Ned is wrong for it.

       WILL turns to see HENSLOWE approaching.

                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                     (to WILL)
                 Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you 
                 two more when you show me the pages.

                           WILL
                 Done.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (arriving)
                 Burbage, I will see you hanged for a 
                 pickpocket.

                           BURBAGE
                 The Queen has commanded, she loves a 
                 comedy and the Master of the Revels 
                 favours us.

                           HENSLOWE
                 And what favour does Mr. Tilney 
                 receive from you?

                           BURBAGE
                 Ask him.

       The Master of the Revels (TILNEY) comes through the 
       curtain officiously.

                           TILNEY
                 She comes!

       He disappears back through the curtains. The hubbub falls 
       silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy PLAYERS 
       know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and 
       find places to peep through.

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF 
       HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.

       THE POV OF THE PLAYERS.

       The arrival of QUEEN ELIZABETH, aged sixty, coming to 
       take her place in the audience at front centre. The hill 
       is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her 
       seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the 
       QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience 
       an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound. 

       Close on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing "W. 
       Shakespeare." WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips 
       it into the mouth of the snake bangle. 

       The curtain draws back and CONDELL as "VALENTINE" and 
       BURBAGE as "PROTEUS" begin the play.

                           CONDELL AS VALENTINE
                 "Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus; 
                 Home-keeping youth have ever homely 
                 wits"

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. THE 
       WINGS/BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       With BURBAGES'S presence accounted for on stage, ROSALINE 
       curls an arm around WILL'S neck. They kiss hungrily. 
       After a moment, WILL pulls back.

                           ROSALINE
                 When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

                           WILL
                 I have lost my gift.

                           ROSALINE
                 You left it in my bed. Come to look 
                 for it again.

                           WILL
                 Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?

                           ROSALINE
                 Burbage has my keeping but you have my 
                 heart.

       WILL takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm. 
       ROSALINE looks at it, then at WILL. Then they kiss again, 
       but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the 
       auditorium.

                           WILL
                 You see? The consumptives plot against 
                 me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let 
                 us go and cough through it."

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. STAGE. DAY.

       "VALENTINE" is on stage with "PROTEUS."

       CONDELL AS VALENTINE

       "To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans: Coy 
       looks with heart sore sighs; One fading moment's mirth 
       With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights"

       As the scene continues, WILL appears at the back of the 
       hall and finds himself next to HENSLOWE.

                           WILL
                 I feel a scene coming on.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Is it about a pirate's daughter?

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACK OF THE BANQUETING HALL/STAGE. 
       DAY.

       Laughter. It is later, and KEMPE is now on stage with his 
       dog. The audience is roaring.

                           HENSLOWE
                 You see? Comedy.

       QUEEN ELIZABETH'S idiosyncratic laugh rises above the 
       others.

                           QUEEN
                 Well played, Master Crab, I commend 
                 you.

       She throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it 
       down. Everyone applauds.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Love and a bit with a dog, that's what 
                 they like.

       Now we meet VIOLA. VIOLA DE LESSEPS is twenty-five and 
       beautiful, and she is laughing with great natural 
       enjoyment. She sits slightly apart from her small family 
       group--her parents, SIR ROBERT DE LESSEPS and LADY 
       MARGARET DE LESSEPS. Part of the group but seated behind 
       as befits her lower status is VIOLA'S NURSE. 

       Elsewhere is LORD WESSEX, our villain. WESSEX is in his 
       forties, dark cruel, self-important. He has noticed 
       VIOLA. The nurse notices him.

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF 
       HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.

       LATER. "VALENTINE" is on stage alone. He is speaking the 
       speech rather more coarsely than the version we hear 
       later.

                           CONDELL AS VALENTINE
                 "What light is light if Silvia be not 
                 seen? 
                 What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? 
                 Unless it be to think that she is by 
                 And feed upon the shadow of 
                 perfection"

       Now we see that VIOLA knows the speech by heart, and is 
       silently mouthing it with the actor.

                           HENSLOWE
                 There's a lady knows your play by 
                 heart.

       But when he turns to WILL he finds that WILL has gone.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       WILL comes into his room, goes straight to his table in 
       the window, and arranges pen, ink, and paper. Now he has 
       his ritual: he spins round once in a circle, rubs his 
       hands together and spits on the floor. Then he sits down, 
       picks up his pen, and stares in front of him. PAUSE. Then 
       he begins to write.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE is undressing her, though VIOLA tries 
       intermittently to push her away. She is still bright with 
       excitement.

                           VIOLA
                 Did you like Proteus or Valentine 
                 best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine 
                 for looks.

                           NURSE
                 I liked the dog, for laughs.

                           VIOLA
                 But Silvia I did not care for much. 
                 His fingers were red from fighting and 
                 he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. 
                 Stage love will never be true love 
                 while the law of the land has our 
                 heroines played by pipsqueak boys in 
                 petticoats! Oh, when can we see 
                 another?

                           NURSE
                 When the Queen commands it.

                           VIOLA
                 But at the playhouse. Nurse?

                           NURSE
                 Be still.

       Now the NURSE is cleaning VIOLA'S ears, one by one, of 
       course. She has an ear-cleaning implement for this. VIOLA 
       submits.

                           NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Playhouses are not for well-born 
                 ladies.

                           VIOLA
                 I am not so well-born.

                           NURSE
                 Well-monied is the same as well-born 
                 and well-married is more so. Lord 
                 Wessex was looking at you tonight.

                           VIOLA
                 All the men at court are without 
                 poetry. If they look at me they see my 
                 father's fortune. I will have poetry 
                 in my life. And adventure. And love. 
                 Love above all.

                           NURSE
                 Like Valentine and Silvia?

                           VIOLA
                 No . . . not the artful postures of 
                 love, but love that over- throws life. 
                 Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot 
                 in the heart, and nothing to be done, 
                 come ruin or rapture. Love like there 
                 has never been in a play.
                     (beat)
                 I will have love or I will end my days 
                 as a . . .

                           NURSE
                 As a nurse.

                           VIOLA
                     (kissing her)
                 But I would be Valentine and Silvia 
                 too. Good Nurse, God save you and good 
                 night. I would stay asleep my whole 
                 life if I could dream myself into a 
                 company of players.

       VIOLA goes over to the window.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE thrusts a twig to her face.

                           NURSE
                 Clean your teeth while you dream, 
                 then.

       Automatically, VIOLA takes the twig and begins brushing 
       her teeth, all the while looking downriver towards the 
       Rose. The NURSE attends her with a beaker of water, and a 
       bowl.

                           NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Now spit

       VIOLA gazes longingly towards the Rose And, there and 
       then, she makes a plan.

       EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

       HENSLOWE is making his way from the theatre to the market 
       place when FENNYMAN and LAMBERT appear at either shoulder 
       and propel him back the way he came. FREES follows 
       behind.

                           FENNYMAN
                 This time we take your boots off!

                           HENSLOWE
                 What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?

                           FENNYMAN
                 The theatres are all closed by the 
                 plague!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Oh, that.

                           FENNYMAN
                 by order of the Master of the Revels!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the 
                 theatre business.
                     (they stop)
                 The natural condition is one of 
                 insurmountable obstacles on the road 
                 to imminent disaster. Believe me, to 
                 be close by the plague is a bagatelle 
                 in the ups and downs of owning a 
                 theatre.

                           FENNYMAN
                 So what do we do?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Nothing. Strangely enough , it all 
                 turns out well.

                           FENNYMAN
                 How?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I don't know. It's a mystery.

                           LAMBERT
                     (dumbly)
                 Should I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

       At this point din is heard in the background. a 
       messenger, ringing a bell, is running though the street.

                           MESSENGER
                 The theatres are reopened. By order of 
                 the Master of the Revels, the theatres 
                 are reopened

       FENNYMAN is intrigued.

                           FREES
                 Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened 
                 the playhouses.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Yes I heard.

       HENSLOWE plays his temporary advantage modestly, 
       shrugging himself free of LAMBERT'S grip.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (to LAMBERT)
                 If you wouldn't mind

       HENSLOWE continues on his way. FENNYMAN watches HENSLOWE, 
       curious.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Where is the play?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Oh, it's coming, it's coming.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       It is. WILL is writing furiously. A burnt-down candle is 
       still alight, although it is day outside the window. He 
       has been writing all night. He has written about ten 
       pages. Pleased with himself and excited, he gathers them 
       up and leaves the room like a man with a mission.

       EXT. WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.

       Leaving the house, pages in hand, WILL nearly knocks down 
       HENSLOWE who has come to see him.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Will! The theatres are

       Before he can finish, WILL brandishes the pages in his 
       hand.

                           WILL
                 Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, 
                 I'm good!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Rosaline? You mean Ethel.

       WILL has gone.

       EXT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

       BURBAGE lives in another part of the city. WILL bangs 
       through the door without ceremony.

                           WILL
                     (shouting)
                 Richard!

       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL enters and calls out.

                           WILL
                 Burbage?

       INT. BURBAGE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

       WILL charges into the bedroom. ROSALINE is in bed. The 
       Master of the Revels is pulling up his breeches. WILL is 
       shattered.

                           WILL
                 Mr. Tilney

       The unsuccessful snake bracelet glints at him from 
       ROSALINE'S arm.

                           TILNEY
                 Like you, I found him not at home!

                           WILL
                 So this is the favour you find in the 
                 Chamberlain's Men.

                           ROSALINE
                 Will!

                           WILL
                     (to ROSALINE)
                 I would have made you immortal.
                     (turning to go)
                 Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by 
                 Will Shakespeare.

                           TILNEY
                 What does Burbage care of that? He is 
                 readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.

                           WILL
                 You have opened the playhouses?

                           TILNEY
                 I have, Master Shakespeare.

                           WILL
                 But the plague

                           TILNEY
                     (sighs)
                 Yes, I know. But he was always hanging 
                 around the house.

       A bell can be heard ringing outside.

                           ROSALINE
                     (to WILL, leaving)
                 Willyou're the only one, Will!--in my 
                 heart.

       EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL emerges looking distraught. A burning brazier stands 
       by the wall. WILL thrusts the pages into the coals. He 
       watches for a moment as the pages catch fire.

       INT. TAVERN. DAY.

       WILL walks in to find the place in an uproar of 
       celebration. A handsome young serving man (NOL) is 
       bumping through with a tray of tankards.

                           NOL
                     (excitedly)
                 Mr. Henslowe!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Yes, I heard. The theatres are open. 
                 But where is my playwright?

       HENSLOWE finds a seat, and takes a tankard off NOL'S 
       tray.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Chalk it up, Nol. I'm hungry, too.

                           NOL
                 The special today is a pig's foot 
                 marinated in juniper-berry vinegar, 
                 served with a buckwheat pancake which 
                 has been

       They are interrupted by WILL who joins them. He looks 
       distracted.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Will! Have you finished?

                           WILL
                 Yes. Nearly.
                     (he taps his forehead)
                 It's all locked safe in here. We need 
                 Ralph for the Pirate King. Good 
                 morning, Master Nol. You will have a 
                 nice little part.

       NOL shouts for you, takes off his apron and flings it 
       behind the bar. HENSLOWE jumps up and embraces WILL. The 
       entire staff and half the customers are now crowding 
       around, actors the lot of them. HENSLOWE bangs the table 
       to shut them all up.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men are 
                 out on tour. I need actors. Those here 
                 who are unknown will have a chance to 
                 be known.

                           ACTOR
                 What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?

                           HENSLOWE
                 It won't cost you a penny! Auditions 
                 in half-an-hour!

       The din of excited chatter returns. He sweeps grandly to 
       the tavern doorwhere he meets RALPH BASHFORD, a big, 
       burly, middle-aged actor.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                 Ralph Bashford! I'd have a part for 
                 you but, alas, I hear you are a 
                 drunkard's drunkard.

                           RALPH
                 Never when I'm working.

       INT. TAVERN. DAY.

       WILL has remained behind, aghast now at his predicament. 
       He goes to the bar.

                           WILL
                 Give me to drink mandragora.

                           BARMAN
                 Straight up, Will?

                           VOICE
                 Give my friend a beaker of your best 
                 brandy.

       WILL turns towards a figure further down the bar. It's 
       CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.

                           WILL
                 Kit

                           MARLOWE
                 How goes it, Will?

                           WILL
                 Wonderful, wonderful.

                           MARLOWE
                 Burbage says you have a play.

                           WILL
                 I have. And chinks to show for it.

       His drink arrives. WILL places a sovereign on the bar.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. 
                 The BARMAN does the business.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 I hear you have a new play for the 
                 Curtain.

                           MARLOWE
                 Not new--my Doctor Faustus.

                           WILL
                 I love your early work. "Was this the 
                 face that launched a thousand ships 
                 and burnt the topless towers of 
                 Ilium?"

                           MARLOWE
                 I have a new one nearly done, and 
                 better. The Massacre at Paris.

                           WILL
                 Good title.

                           MARLOWE
                 And yours?

                           WILL
                 Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
                     (beat, sighs despondently)
                 Yes, I know.

                           MARLOWE
                 What is the story?

                           WILL
                 Well, there's a pirate
                     (confesses)
                 In truth, I have not written a word.

                           MARLOWE
                 Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of 
                 love.

                           WILL
                 Yes, that's good. Until he meets

                           MARLOWE
                 Ethel.

                           WILL
                 Do you think?

                           MARLOWE
                 The daughter of his enemy.

                           WILL
                     (thoughtfully)
                 The daughter of his enemy.

                           MARLOWE
                 His best friend is killed in a duel by 
                 Ethel's brother or something. His name 
                 is Mercutio.

                           WILL
                 Mercutiogood name.

       NOL hurries back to WILL'S side.

                           NOL
                 Will--they're waiting for you!

                           WILL
                 I'm coming.

       He drains his glass.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Good luck with yours, Kit.

                           MARLOWE
                 I thought your play was for Burbage.

                           WILL
                 This is a different one.

                           MARLOWE
                     (trying to work it out)
                 A different one you haven't written?

       WILL makes a helpless gesture and hurries after NOL.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. GALLERY/STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       HENSLOWE and WILL are sitting in the gallery, listening 
       to a YOUNG ACTOR auditioning.

                           YOUNG ACTOR
                 " Was this the face that launched a 
                 thousand ships, And burnt the topless 
                 towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me 
                 immortal with a kiss!"

                           HENSLOWE
                 Thank you.

       HENSLOWE and WILL look a bit deflated. The YOUNG ACTOR 
       leaves and is replaced by a SECOND ACTOR.

                           SECOND ACTOR
                 I would like to give you something 
                 from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

                           HENSLOWE
                 How refreshing.

                           SECOND ACTOR
                 "Was this the face that launched a 
                 thousand ships, And burnt the topless 
                 towers of Ilium?"

       HENSLOWE and WILL let him continue a bit further, but 
       exchange despairing looks. A succession of would-be 
       actors offer their version of Marlowe's lines, each as 
       inappropriate as the other. Among them is a small URCHIN.

                           URCHIN
                 "the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet 
                 Helen, make me immortal with a--?"

                           HENSLOWE
                     (bellows)
                 Thank you!

       The URCHIN leaves, glowering furiously, and is replaced 
       by a beanpole of a man (WASBASH). WABASH has a bad 
       stutter.

                           WABASH
                 "W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f-f-
                 f-face"

                           HENSLOWE
                     (unexpectedly)
                 Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent. 
                 Report to the property master.

       WILL looks at HENSLOWE in outrage.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                     (apologetically)
                 My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I 
                 have a few debts here and there. Well, 
                 that seems to be everybody. Did you 
                 see a Romeo?

                           WILL
                 I did not.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Well, I to my work, you to yours. When 
                 can I see pages?

                           WILL
                 Tomorrow

       HENSLOWE leaves him.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                     (a prayer)
                 please God.

       WILL sits brooding alone for a moment. Then he realizes 
       he is being addressed from the stage. ANOTHER ACTOR.

                           ACTOR
                 May I begin, sir?

       WILL looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man, 
       with a hat shadowing his eyes.

                           WILL
                 Your name?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Thomas Kent. I would like to do a 
                 speech by a writer who commands the 
                 heart of every player.

       WILL can hardly manage a nod.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
                 "What light is light, if Silvia be not 
                 seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be 
                 not by? Unless it be to think that she 
                 is by And feed upon the shadow of 
                 perfection.

       It does not take four lines of "VALENTINE'S" speech to 
       confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is 
       VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon 
       gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has 
       found his "ROMEO".

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
                 " except I be by Silvia in the night, 
                 There is no music in the nightingale. 
                 Unless I look on Silvia in the day, 
                 There is no day for me to look upon."

       WILL interrupts "him."

                           WILL
                 Take off your hat.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 My hat?

                           WILL
                 Where did you learn how to do that?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 I . . .

                           WILL
                 Wait there.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Are you Mr. Shakespeare?

                           WILL
                 Let me see you. Take off your hat.

       THOMAS begins to panic. WILL jumps down to ground level. 
       THOMAS runs offstage, to WILL'S bewilderment. WILL 
       hurries after him. We go with WILL as he crosses the 
       stage, then backstage, then into the

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. RETIRING ROOM. DAY.

       RETIRING ROOM which is crowded with actors and HENSLOWE'S 
       lieutenant, property manager, copier, and general 
       factotum who is a new character, PETER.

                           ACTOR
                 What are we playing?

                           NOL
                 Where are the pages?

       WILL enters into the middle of this.

                           WILL
                     (shouts)
                 Where's the boy?

       NOBODY knows what he is talking about. WABASH, the 
       stutterer, grabs Will's hand and shakes it excitedly.

                           WABASH
                 B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg!

       The street door is swinging shut. WILL sees it. He fights 
       his way through the men to get to the door.

       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BANKSIDE. DAY.

       WILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing 
       with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins, 
       tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews 
       (lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time 
       before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded 
       street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank.

       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

       When WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in 
       a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The 
       river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a 
       number of waiting "taxis." WILL jumps into the nearest 
       one and shouts at the "Taxi Driver" BOATMAN.

                           WILL
                 Follow that boat!

                           BOATMAN
                 Right you are, governor!

       WILL sits in the stern of the boat and the BOATMAN sits 
       facing him, rowing lustily.

                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)
                 I know your face. Are you an actor?

                           WILL
                     (oh God, here we go again)
                 Yes.

                           BOATMAN
                 Yes, I've seen you in something. That 
                 one about a king.

                           WILL
                 Really?

                           BOATMAN
                 I had the Christopher Marlowe in my 
                 boat once.

       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

       LATER. The BOATMAN is puffing. WILL is looking ahead to 
       where THOMAS'S boat has reached a jetty on the farther 
       shore, a private jetty attached to a rich house on the 
       north bank. WILL sees THOMAS jump out of his boat and run 
       toward the house.

                           WILL
                 Do you know that house?

                           BOATMAN
                 Sir Robert De Lesseps.

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL runs towards the house.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES'S HOUSE. DAY.

       THOMAS rushes up the back stairs, removing his hat. Her 
       hair tumbles down about her shoulders, so we will call 
       her VIOLA again.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.

       Her mother LADY DE LESSEPS, is talking to the NURSE.

       LADY DE LESSEPS

       Where is she? Our guests are upon us, Lord Wessex too, 
       bargaining for a bride. My husband will have it settled 
       tonight.

       Behind her, the door opens revealing VIOLA as THOMAS to 
       the NURSES view, but only for a moment. The door closes 
       again as LADY DE LESSEPS turns.

                           LADY DE LESSEPS (CONT'D)
                 Tomorrow he drags me off to the 
                 country and it will be three weeks 
                 gone before we return from our 
                 estates.

       A different door communicating to the next room, opens 
       and VIOLA comes in after a lightning dress change into a 
       robe. She curtseys to her mother.

                           VIOLA
                 God save you, mother.
                     (to NURSE)
                 Ho water, nurse.

       The NURSE looks at her, round-eyed.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY.

       From a cauldron on the stove, hot water is poured into 
       two pails, by the a KITCHEN BOY under the NURSE'S 
       command.

                           SCULLERY MAID (O.S.)
                 Thomas Kent, sir? No sir.

                           WILL (O.S.)
                 The actor

                           NURSE
                 Who asks for him?

       WILL has come to the kitchen door with a letter.

                           WILL
                 William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and 
                 playwright of the Rose.

       The NURSE sends the SCULLERY MAID back to work.

                           NURSE
                 Master Kent ismy nephew.

                           WILL
                     (giving her the letter)
                 I will wait.

                           NURSE
                 Much god may it do you.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BATHROOM. EVENING.

       VIOLA in her bath, reads WILL'S letter. The NURSE is 
       adding hot water to the tub.

                           VIOLA
                     (delighted)
                 He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, 
                 a young man of Verona.

                           NURSE
                     (unimpressed)
                 Verona again.

                           VIOLA
                     (devouring the letter)
                 A comedy of quarreling families 
                 reconciled in the discovery of Romeo 
                 to be the very same Capulet cousin 
                 stolen from the cradle and fostered to 
                 manhood by his Montague mother that 
                 was robbed of her own child by the 
                 Pirate King!

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

       WILL waits hopefully. The kitchen door opens and a 
       SERVANT flings a bucket of dirty water in the general 
       direction of the gutter. WILL hops nimbly aside and 
       escapes a soaking.

                           SERVANT
                 Be off!

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE is helping VIOLA into her party dress.

                           NURSE
                 Your mother, and your father

                           VIOLA
                     (gaily)
                 From tomorrow, away in the country for 
                 three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not 
                 handsome?

                           NURSE
                 He looks well enough for a mountebank.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent 
                 the life of Viola De Lesseps's 
                 dreaming.

                           NURSE
                     (firmly)
                 My lady, this play will end badly. I 
                 will tell.

                           VIOLA
                     (twice as firmly)
                 You will not tell. As you love me and 
                 as I love you, you will bind my breast 
                 and buy me a boy's wig!

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

       WILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying 
       instruments. WILL recognizes them.

                           WILL
                 Master Plum! What business here?

                           MUSICIAN
                 A five shilling business, Will. We 
                 play for the dancing.

       The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a 
       GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who 
       have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the 
       house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX 
       skid to a halt and enter the house.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL has got in with the MUSICIANS. Competently enough he 
       strums along with them on the bandstand. Two dozen guests 
       are enough to crowd the space for dancing. WILL glances 
       around, looking for THOMAS KENT. He stops a passing 
       SERVANT, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.

                           SERVANT
                 Musicians don't eat, Sir Robert's 
                 orders.

                           WILL
                 I seek Master Thomas Kent.

       It means nothing to the SERVANT who moves on. ANGLE ON 
       WESSEX and SIR ROBERT.

                           SIR ROBERT
                 She is a beauty, my lord, as would 
                 take a king to church for a dowry of a 
                 nutmeg.

                           WESSEX
                 My plantations in Virginia are not 
                 mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an 
                 ancient name that will bring you 
                 preferment when your grandson is a 
                 Wessex. Is she fertile?

                           SIR ROBERT
                 She will breed. If she do not, send 
                 her back.

                           WESSEX
                 Is she obedient?

                           SIR ROBERT
                 As any mule in Christendom. But if you 
                 are the man to rider her, their are 
                 rubies in the saddlebag.

                           WESSEX
                 I like her.

       ANGLE on WILL--watching the dancing. Then he sees VIOLA in 
       the crowd. He turns to blood. 
       Love at first sight, no doubt about it. VIOLA has not 
       seen him. She is doing a daughter's duty among her 
       parents' friends. The guests form up to begin a changing-
       partners dance (the very same one you get in every ROMEO 
       and JULIET).

                           WILL
                     (to Musician)
                 By all the stars in heaven, who is 
                 she?

                           MUSICIAN
                 Viola de Lesseps. Dream on, Will.

       WILL leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to 
       keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers. VIOLA 
       moves through patterns of the dance untilas night 
       follows day, she finds WILL opposite her. He has 
       insinuated himself into the dance. VIOLA gasps.

                           VIOLA
                 Master Shakespeare

       WILL reacts, surprised by her reaction. The dance 
       separates them. VIOLA finds herself opposite WESSEX.

                           WESSEX
                 My lady Viola.

                           VIOLA
                 My lord.

                           WESSEX
                 I have spoken with your father.

                           VIOLA
                 So my lord? I speak with him every 
                 day.

       WESSEX scowls. The dance separates them. VIOLA finds 
       herself opposite WILL again. WILL stares at her 
       entranced.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 Good sir ?

       WILL has lost his tongue.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 I heard you are a poet.

       WILL nods in his trance and she smiles at him.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 But a poet of no words?

       WILL tries to speak but the silver tongue won't work. He 
       is dumb with adoration. Suddenly WESSEX takes him affably 
       by the elbow and leads him into an alcove.

                           WESSEX
                     (smiling evilly)
                 "Poet?"

                           WILL
                     (coming round form the 
                      anaesthetic and not noticing 
                      the danger)
                 I was a poet till now, but I have seen 
                 beauty that puts my poems at one with 
                 the talking ravens at the Tower.

       To his surprise he finds a lordly dagger at this throat.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                     (startled)
                 How do I offend, my lord?

                           WESSEX
                 By coveting my property. I cannot shed 
                 blood in her house but I will cut your 
                 throat anon. You have a name?

                           WILL
                     (gulps)
                 Christopher Marlowe at your service.

       WESSEX shoves him through the nearest door.

       VIOLA'S eyes are searching the room for WILL. She finds 
       WESSEX smiling at her. She looks away.

       EXT. DE LESSEPS' GARDEN/VIOLA'S BALCONY. NIGHT

       There is a lighted window on the balcony. VIOLA, dressed 
       for bed, and the NURSE pass across the lighted space. 
       WILL is in the garden. He sees her. The light in the room 
       is extinguished. WILL sighs. Then VIOLA comes out onto 
       the balcony in the moonlight. WILL gasps. He watches her. 
       VIOLA sighs dreamily.

                           VIOLA
                 Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of 
                 Verona. A comedy. By William 
                 Shakespeare.

       WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of 
       hiding, and approaches the balcony.

                           WILL
                     (whispers)
                 My lady!

                           VIOLA
                     (gasps)
                 Who is there?

                           WILL
                 Will Shakespeare!

       The NURSE calls "Madam!" from inside the room.

                           VIOLA
                 Anon, good nurse. Anon.
                     (to WILL)
                 Master Shakespeare?!

                           WILL
                 The same, alas.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh but why "alas?"

                           WILL
                 A lowly player.

                           VIOLA
                 Alas indeed, for I thought you the 
                 highest poet of my esteem and a writer 
                 of plays that capture my heart.

                           WILL
                 Oh--I am him too!

       The NURSE calls again.

                           VIOLA
                     (to NURSE)
                 Anon, anon!
                     (to WILL)
                 I will come again.

       She goes inside for a moment.

                           WILL
                     (to himself)
                 Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be 
                 punished for this!

       VIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Oh my lady, my love!

                           VIOLA
                 If they find you here they will kill 
                 you.

                           WILL
                 You can bring them with a word.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, not for the world!

       The NURSE calls her again: "Madam!"

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 Anon, nurse!

       But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that 
       there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb 
       up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a 
       soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops 
       his head over the parapet and is face to face with the 
       NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the 
       tree.

       EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

       Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle 
       flames appear in different windows, the garden door is 
       flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one 
       hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top 
       of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He 
       could have written it better.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN.

       WILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and 
       metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen 
       sheets. He is inspired.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       It is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing 
       pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are 
       looking through their pages.

                           JOHN
                 "Draw if you be men!
                     (to JAMES)
                 Gregory, remember thy washing blow."

                           NOL
                 "Part, fools, put up your swords."

       WILL is going around pumping hands and slapping 
       shoulders, flushed with excitement. HENSLOWE is reading 
       his pages, worried. RALPH BASHFORD is next to him.

                           HENSLOWE
                 It starts well, and then it's all long-
                 faced about some Rosaline. Where's the 
                 comedy, Will. Where's the dog?
                     (to RALPH)
                 Do you think it is funny?

                           RALPH
                 I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse. 
                 That's funny

       WILL pulls HENSLOWE aside.

                           WILL
                 We are at least six men short, and 
                 those we have will be overparted, 
                 ranters and stutterers who should be 
                 sent back to the stews. My Romeo has 
                 let me down. I see disaster.

                           HENSLOWE
                 We are at least four acts short, Will, 
                 if you are looking for disaster.

       WILL as notices a young scruffy thirteen-year-old actor, 
       the URCHIN we met before.

                           WILL
                 Who are you, master?

                           URCHIN
                 I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's 
                 daughter.

                           WILL
                     (furiously)
                 I'll be damned if you are!

       And he helps the URCHIN off with a kick. The URCHIN 
       glowers with resentment. HENSLOWE finds himself face to 
       face with FENNYMAN.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Is it going well?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Very well.

                           FENNYMAN
                 But nothing is happening.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Yes, but very well.

                           WILL
                     (shouts)
                 Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Who is that?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Nobody. The author.

                           WILL
                 We are about to embark on a great 
                 voyage.

                           HENSLOWE
                 It is customary to make a little 
                 speech on the first day. It does no 
                 harm and authors like it.

                           WILL
                 You want to know what parts you are to 
                 receive. All will be settled as we go

       That's as far as he gets before there is a dramatic 
       interruption--the public entrance door is flung open and 
       SIX MEN make a loud entrance, headed by NED ALLEYN, the 
       actor, who is a handsome piratical figure with a big 
       voice and a big sword.

                           ALLEYN
                 Huzzah! The Admiral's Men are returned 
                 to the house!

       He gets various reactions. HENSLOWE and WILL shout his 
       name joyfully, some of the actors are friends with the 
       new group and behave accordingly, others know they are 
       out of a job. FENNYMAN recovers, or tries to.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Who is this?

       ALLEYN slaps him aside with his sword.

                           ALLEYN
                     (roars)
                 Silence, you god! I am Hieronimo! I am 
                 Tamburlaine! I am Faustus! I am 
                 Barrabas, the Jew of Malta--of yes, 
                 Master Will, and I am Henry VI. What 
                 is the play, and what is my part?

       FENNYMAN is impressed.

                           FENNYMAN
                 A moment, sir!

                           ALLEYN
                     (roars)
                 Who are you?

                           FENNYMAN
                     (bleating)
                 I am the money!

                           ALLEYN
                 Then you may remain so long as you 
                 remain silent. Pay attention and you 
                 will see how genius creates a legend.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (respectfully)
                 Thank you, sir.

                           WILL
                 We are in desperate want of a 
                 Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of 
                 Verona

                           ALLEYN
                 And the title of this piece?

                           WILL
                 Mercutio

                           HENSLOWE
                 Is it?

                           ALLEYN
                 I will play him!

       Half a dozen of the ADMIRAL'S MEN will be given roles in 
       our play and we meet them and identify them as WILL 
       enthusiastically shakes hands.

                           WILL
                 Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, 
                 George Bryan! James Armitage!
                     (and now greeting SAM GOSSE, 
                      the female star of the 
                      Admiral's Men)
                 Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to 
                 fall in love again?

                           SAM
                     (hoarsely)
                 I am, Master Shakespeare.

                           WILL
                     (concerned)
                 But your voice
                     (he thrust a hand between 
                      SAM'S legs)
                 Have they dropped?

                           SAM
                     (a girlie voice now)
                 No, no, a touch of cold only. We 
                 suspect he is lying but WILL has 
                 turned away.

                           WILL
                 Master Henslowe, you have your actors.

       He leaves, passing by the humbled FENNYMAN.

                           FENNYMAN
                 I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. 
                 Wonderful.

                           WILL
                 Yes, I saw it.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Of course, it was mighty writing. 
                 There is no one like Marlowe

       WILL is used to it. He goes.

       EXT. RIVERBANK. DAY.

       WILL arrives in a hurry at the wharfside, and looks 
       vainly in the direction of the DE LESSEPSES' house: no 
       THOMAS.

       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE DOOR. DAY.

       WILL looks down the alley:--no THOMAS. He turns away. The 
       URCHIN, the short-lived Ethel, is sitting in the alley.

                           WILL
                 Better fortune, boy.

                           URCHIN
                     (shrugs)
                 I was in a play. They cut my head off 
                 in Titus Andronicus. When I write 
                 plays, they will be like Titus.

                           WILL
                     (pleased)
                 You admire it?

       The URCHIN nods grimly.

                           URCHIN
                 I like it when they cut heads off. And 
                 the daughter mutilated with knives.

                           WILL
                 Oh. What is your name?

                           URCHIN.
                 John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty.

       Because a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest. 
       The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches 
       the result with sober interest.

                           URCHIN (CONT'D)
                 Plenty of blood. That is the only 
                 writing.

       WILL backs away, unnerved by the boy.

                           URCHIN (CONT'D)
                 Wait, you'll see the cat bites his 
                 head off.

                           WILL
                 I have to get back.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       On stage . . . the actors carry their parts.

       NOL AS BENVOLIO

       "See where he comes. So please you step aside; I'll know 
       his grievance or be much denied."

                           MONTAGUE
                 "I would thou wert so happy by thy 
                 stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam, 
                 let's away."

       Onstage "MONTAGUE" and "LADY MONTAGUE" make their exit. 
       Offstage, WILL appears next to HENSLOWE.

                           WILL
                 Cut round him for now.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (not understanding)
                 What? Who?

                           WILL
                 Romeo.

                           HENSLOWE
                 The one who came with your letter?

                           WILL
                 What?

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO (O.S.)
                 "Good morrow, cousin."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO (O.S.)
                 "Is the day so young?"

       The voice is THOMAS'S. WILL turns back to the stage and 
       sees him. Today THOMAS has a wig as well as his small 
       mustache.

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 "But new struck nine."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that 
                 my father that went hence so fast?"

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's 
                 hours?"

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Not having that which, having, makes 
                 them short."

                           WILL
                 Good

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 "In love?"

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Out."

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 "Of love?"

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Out of her favour where I am in 
                 love."

                           WILL
                     (interrupting)
                 No, no, noDon't spend it all at once!

       The rehearsal stops.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Yes, sir.

                           WILL
                 Do you understand me?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 No, sir.

                           WILL
                 He is speaking about a baggage we 
                 never even meet! What will be left in 
                 your purse when he meets his Juliet?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Juliet? You mean Ethel.

                           WILL
                     (rounding on him)
                 God's teeth, am I to suffer this 
                 constant stream of interruption?!
                     (to THOMAS)
                 What will you do in Act Two when he 
                 meets the love of his life?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (timidly--looking through his 
                      few sheets of paper)
                 I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen 
                 Act Two.

                           WILL
                 Of course you have not! I have not 
                 written it!

       Alone in the auditorium, FENNYMAN looks and listens, 
       fascinated. So this is theatre!

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Go once more!

       NED ALLEYN comes out of the wings, frowning over his 
       manuscript.

                           ALLEYN
                 WillWhere is Mercutio?

                           WILL
                     (tapping his forehead)
                 Locked safe in here. I leave the scene 
                 in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a 
                 sonnet to write.

       WILL moves back into the wings where HENSLOWE is looking 
       anxious.

                           HENSLOWE
                 A sonnet? You mean a play.

       WILL moves on, ignoring him. As he goes, we see that 
       VIOLA is love-struck by him, a riot in the heart.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. STAIRCASE. DAY.

       VIOLA still dressed as THOMAS, sonnet in hand, runs up 
       the stairs to her room. From the other end of the house 
       WESSEX can be heard ranting.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT.

       LORD WESSEX is being kept waiting. The NURSE is bearing 
       the brunt of his impatience.

                           WESSEX
                 Two hours at prayer!

                           NURSE
                 Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at 
                 prayer is not piety, it is self-
                 importance!

                           NURSE
                 It would be better that you return 
                 tomorrow, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 It would be better that you tell her 
                 to get off her knees and show some 
                 civility to her six-day lord and 
                 master.

       VIOLA opens the door. She has changed hurriedly--too 
       hurriedly: the effect of her glorious hair falling to her 
       bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache. Fortunately, 
       the NURSE spots her before WESSEX does and by coming 
       forward to greet her, the NURSE manages to shield Viola 
       from view, communicate the problem, and announce WESSEX'S 
       presence, so that by the time the NURSE has passed by 
       VIOLA and let herself out of the room, the moustache has 
       disappeared.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 My lady VIOLA.

                           VIOLA
                 Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.

                           WESSEX
                 I am aware of it, but it is beauty's 
                 privilege.

                           VIOLA
                 You flatter, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 No. I have spoken to the Queen.
                     (pause)
                 Her majesty's consent is requisite 
                 when a Wessex takes a wife, and once 
                 gained, her consent is her command.

                           VIOLA
                 Do you intend to marry, my lord?

                           WESSEX
                 Your father should keep you better 
                 informed. He has bought me for you. He 
                 returns from his estates to see us 
                 married two weeks from Saturday.
                     (pause)
                 You are allowed to show your pleasure.

                           VIOLA
                 I do not love you, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 How your mind hops about! Your father 
                 was a shopkeeper, your children will 
                 bear arms, and I will recover my 
                 fortune. That is the only matter under 
                 discussion today. You will like 
                 Virginia.

                           VIOLA
                 Virginia?!

                           WESSEX
                 Why, yes! My fortune lies in my 
                 plantations. The tobacco weed. I need 
                 four thousand pounds to fit out a ship 
                 and put my investments to work--I fancy 
                 tobacco has a future. We will not stay 
                 there long, three or four years . . .

                           VIOLA
                 But why me?

                           WESSEX
                 It was your eyes. No, your lips.

       He kisses her with more passion than ceremony. VIOLA 
       recoils, and slaps him.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 Will you defy your father and your 
                 Queen?

                           VIOLA
                 The Queen has consented?

                           WESSEX
                 She wants to inspect you. At 
                 Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, 
                 modest, grateful and brief.

                           VIOLA
                     (forced to submit)
                 I will do my duty, my lord.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       She is writing to WILL. His letter-poem is on her table. 
       We can read part of it. "Shall I compare thee to a 
       summer's day"

       Now we see what VIOLA is writing.

       INSERT: "Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I beseech 
       you, banish me from yours--I am to marry Lord Wessex-- a 
       daughter's duty "

       She sheds a romantic, unhappy tear.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       SAM is now "JULIET." The play has evidently reached Act I 
       Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of "ROMEO" and 
       "JULIET" in a simplified version of the changing-partners 
       dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge.

                           ALLEYN
                 Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage!

       The dance goes wrong. it is THOMAS'S fault.

                           ALLEYN (CONT'D)
                     (furious)
                 Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage! 
                 Are you a lady, Mr. Kent?

       THOMAS mutters a blushing apology. WILL arrives the 
       bystanders, clutching fresh pages. He gives these to 
       PETER. NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an 
       argument.

                           WILL
                     (preempting)
                 You did not like the speech?

                           ALLEYN
                 The speech is excellent.
                     (he does the first line 
                      impressively)
                 "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been 
                 with you!" Excellent and a good 
                 length. But then he disappears for the 
                 length of a bible.

       WILL points significantly at the pages he has given 
       PETER.

                           WILL
                 There you have his duel, a skirmish of 
                 words and swords such as I never 
                 wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such 
                 passion and poetry as your ever heard: 
                 "a plague on both your houses!"

       NED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns 
       back.

                           ALLEYN
                 He dies?

       But the author has escaped.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

       Up aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down 
       to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round 
       in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the 
       floor. That done, he picks up his pen.

       EXT. STREET. NIGHT.

       WILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into 
       BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern.

                           BURBAGE
                 Will!

       WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls 
       after him.

                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                 And where are my pages . . .

       WILL hurries on.

       EXT. RIVERBANK. DUSK.

       VIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From 
       behind, in the direction of Bankside, "he" hears 
       shouting.

                           WILL
                     (O.S. shouting)
                 Did you give her my letter?

       VIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind, 
       following in another boat. She takes a letter from her 
       coat and holds it aloft.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (calling)
                 And this for you.

       EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.

       WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open 
       the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He 
       collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA.

                           WILL
                 Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I 
                 am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, 
                 like a puppet in a box.

                           BOATMAN
                 Writer, is he?

       WILL turns on him savagely

                           WILL
                 Row your boat.

       EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.

       WILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation 
       intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The 
       BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore 
       him.

                           WILL
                 She tells me to keep away. She is to 
                 marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 If you love her, you must do what she 
                 asks.

                           WILL
                 And break her heart and mine?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 It is only ours you can know.

                           WILL
                 She loves me, Thomas!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Does she say so?

                           WILL
                 No. And yet she does where the ink has 
                 run with tears. Was she weeping when 
                 she gave you this?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 I  Her letter came to me by the 
                 nurse.

                           WILL
                 Your aunt?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (catching up)
                 Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a 
                 little. Tell me how you love her, 
                 Will.

                           WILL
                 Like a sickness and its cure together.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and 
                 heat.
                     (collecting herself)
                 Is your lady beautiful? Since I came 
                 to visit from the country, I have not 
                 seen her close. Tell me, is she 
                 beautiful?

                           WILL
                 Oh, if I could write the beauty of her 
                 eyes! I was born to look in them and 
                 know myself.

       He is looking into VIOLA'S eyes. She holds his look, but 
       WILL belies his words.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 And her lips?

                           WILL
                 Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early 
                 morning rose would wither on the 
                 branch, if it could feel envy!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 And her voice? Like lark song?

                           WILL
                 Deeper. Softer. None of your 
                 twittering larks! I would banish 
                 nightingales from her garden before 
                 they interrupt her song.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 She sings too?

                           WILL
                 Constantly. Without doubt. And plays 
                 the lute, she has a natural ear. And 
                 her bosom--did I mention her bosom?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (glinting)
                 What of her bosom?

                           WILL
                 Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round 
                 and rare as golden apples!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 I think the lady is wise to keep your 
                 love at a distance. For what lady 
                 could live up to it close to, when her 
                 eyes and lips and voice may be no more 
                 beautiful than mine? Besides, can a 
                 lady born to wealth and noble marriage 
                 love happily with a Bankside poet and 
                 player?

                           WILL
                     (fervently)
                 Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of 
                 rank or riverbank! It will spark 
                 between a queen and the poor vagabond 
                 who plays the king, and their love 
                 should be minded by each, for love 
                 denied blights the soul we owe to God! 
                 So tell my lady, William Shakespeare 
                 waits for her in the garden!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 But what of Lord Wessex?

                           WILL
                 For one kiss, I would defy a thousand 
                 Wessexes!

       The boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house. 
       The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her 
       round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her. 
       The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth 
       and jumps out of the boat.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, Will!

       She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the 
       house.

                           BOATMAN
                 Thank you, my lady!

                           WILL
                     (stunned)
                 Lady?

                           BOATMAN
                 Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she 
                 was this high. Wouldn't deceive a 
                 child.

       WILL gets out of the boat.

                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)
                     (reaching under his seat)
                 Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a 
                 writer myself.

       The BOATMAN produces his memoirs in manuscript.

                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)
                 It wouldn't take you long to read it, 
                 I expect you know all the booksellers 
                 . . .

       But WILL has gone.

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' GARDEN. NIGHT.

       WILL drops over the wall into the garden and without 
       hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL comes in through the window, just as VIOLA enters by 
       the door. They stare at each other across the room.

                           WILL
                 Can you love a fool?

                           VIOLA
                 Can you love a player?

       They run together and fall into a passionate kiss.

                           WILL
                     (springs back)
                 Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps 
                 as mistook in me as I was mistook in 
                 Thomas Kent.

                           VIOLA
                 Answer me only this: are you the 
                 author of the plays of William 
                 Shakespeare?

                           WILL
                 I am.

                           VIOLA
                 Then kiss me again for I am not 
                 mistook.

       They run together and fall into a passionate kiss. VIOLA 
       fumbles with his clothing, he with hers.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 I do not know how to undress a man.

                           WILL
                 It is strange to me, too.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE has come to listen. She puts her ear against 
       the door. Because she hears muffled voices, she looks 
       startled.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL is half-naked. VIOLA is down to her petticoat, and 
       chemise. The petticoat comes away. WILL flings it aside. 
       He takes off her chemise. He is startled to find that she 
       is tightly bandaged round the bosom. WILL finds the loose 
       end and spins her naked.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE, drags a chair--a rocker--outside the bedroom 
       door, and takes up her position. She sits down, keeping 
       guard. Pretty soon there comes the regular creak of 
       VIOLA'S bed. The NURSE fans herself furiously with her 
       little lacy fan. She crosses herself. A CHAMBERMAID comes 
       along the gallery outside the bedroom door. She is 
       dusting her way along. The CHAMBERMAID becomes aware of 
       the regular creaking. She pauses. The NURSE begins to 
       rock in her chair, keeping time with the creaking from 
       within. The CHAMBERMAID stares at the NURSE. The NURSE 
       stares at the CHAMBERMAID.

                           NURSE
                 Go to, go to.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

       WILL and VIOLA have finished making love, and lie in each 
       other's arms.

                           VIOLA
                 I would not have thought it. There is 
                 something better than a play.

                           WILL
                 There is.

                           VIOLA
                 Even your play.

                           WILL
                     (frowns)
                 Oh

                           VIOLA
                 And that was only my first try.

                           WILL
                 Well perhaps better than my first.
                     (he kisses her again)

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAWN.

       Dawn is breaking. The sun lacing the severing clouds with 
       envious streaks.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN

       The NURSE has fallen asleep in her rocking chair.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.

       A rooster crows at some distance. VIOLA and WILL are in 
       bed. She stirs drowsily. VIOLA, coming awake, speaks his 
       name and he kisses her.

                           VIOLA
                 Will

       Then he starts to get out of bed.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 You would not leave me?

                           WILL
                 I must. Look-- how pale the window.

                           VIOLA
                     (pulling him down)
                 Moonlight!

                           WILL
                 No, the morning rooster woke me.

                           VIOLA
                 It was the owl--come to bed

       She is winning. She kisses him and pulls the bedclothes 
       around them.

                           WILL
                     (giving in)
                 Oh, let Henslowe wait.

                           VIOLA
                     (pausing, pushing him away)
                 Mr. Henslowe?

                           WILL
                     (persisting)
                 Let him be damned for his pages!

                           VIOLA
                 Oh--no, no!

                           WILL
                     (kissing her)
                 There is time. It is still dark.

                           VIOLA
                 It is broad day!
                     (the rooster crows again)
                 The rooster tells us so!

                           WILL
                 It was the owl. Believe me, love, it 
                 was the owl.

       He kisses her and starts to make love to her again. VIOLA 
       gives him a shove which pushes him onto the floor. She 
       sits up and pulls on her gown.

                           VIOLA
                 You would leave us players without a 
                 scene to read today?!

       There's a knock at the door.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VIOLA'S 
       BEDROOM/VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.

       The NURSE is knocking. VIOLA comes to the door.

                           NURSE
                 My lady, the house is stirring, it is 
                 a new day.

       VIOLA looks beautified by the hours that have passed.

                           VIOLA
                 It is a new world!

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       The cut is to the middle of a rehearsal. We are coming up 
       to the moment when "ROMEO" and "JULIET" kiss for the 
       first time (Act I Scene V) NED ALLEYN is in charge but 
       WILL is watching. His life has turned perfect.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Have not saints lips, and holy 
                 palmers too?"

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use 
                 in prayer."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what 
                 hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest 
                 faith turn to despair."

       WILL is in her eye-line. Her eyes flash an intimate 
       secret look to him.

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Saints do not move, though grant for 
                 prayer's sake."

       And VIOLA misses her cue as a result.

                           SAM
                     (prompting her)
                 It's you.

                           ALLEYN
                     (roars)
                 Suffering cats!

       VIOLA guiltily picks up her line.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Then move not, while my prayer's 
                 effect I take."

       In character, VIOLA kisses SAM, demurely, but apparently 
       not demurely enough for WILL, who gives a twitch.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO(CONT'D)
                 "Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin 
                 is purg'd."

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Then have my lips the sin that they 
                 have took."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly 
                 urg'd. Give me my sin again."

       VIOLA kisses SAM again. WILL gives a major twitch, which 
       in fact catapults his body onto the stage. Everybody 
       looks at him in surprise.

                           WILL
                 Yesyesernot quite rightit is more 
                 let me
                     (as JULIET)
                 "Then have my lips the sin that they 
                 have took."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly 
                 urg'd. Give me my sin again."

       VIOLA kisses WILL. They lose themselves for a fraction of 
       a moment. As VIOLA withdraws her lips, WILL'S lips are 
       going for it again.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO (CONT'D)
                 "You kiss by th' book."

                           ALLEYN
                     (to Will, sarcastically)
                 Well! It was lucky you were here! Why 
                 do not I write the rest of your play 
                 while you

                           WILL
                     (apologising, retreating)
                 Yes, yescontinue. Now the Nurse. 
                 Where is Ralph?

       RALPH has been ready and waiting.

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Madam, your mother craves a word with 
                 you."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "What is her mother?"

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Marry bachelor, Her mother is the 
                 lady of the house"

       WILL has retreated to

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       He is behind the curtain now.

                           RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)
                 "And a good lady, and wise and 
                 virtuous. I nurse her daughter that 
                 you talk'd withal"

       During RALPH'S lines (which are continuous) WILL stands 
       in the shadow behind the curtain, alone, agitated.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       RALPH AS NURSE

       "I tell you, he that can lay hold of her (he makes the 
       money sign) Shall have the chinks."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Is she a Capulet" Oh dear account. My 
                 life is my foe's debt."

       NOL, AS "BENVOLIO," at a party, carrying a goblet, tipsy, 
       enters the scene.

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                     (to ROMEO)
                 "Away, be gone, the sport is at best."

       VIOLA, about to make her exit, has her hand holding the 
       curtain at the gap.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

       WILL is kissing her hand.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Ay, so I fear; the more is my 
                 unrest."

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

       VIOLA comes through the curtain. WILL and VIOLA kiss, 
       dangerously--they are in a narrow space, hidden from the 
       general backstage area.

                           SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
                 "Come hither nurse. What is yond 
                 gentleman?"

                           VIOLA
                     (to Will)
                 Oh let it be night!

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "I know not."

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Go ask his name--If he be married, My 
                 grave is like to be my wedding bed."

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

       "JULIET'S" line bits WILL between the eyes. WILL pulls 
       away.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, do not go

                           WILL
                 I must. I must

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       As WILL races up the ladder to his writer's corner, the 
       rehearsal can be heard continuing.

                           RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)
                 "His name is Romeo, and a Montague, 
                 The only son of your great enemy."

                           ALLEYN (O.S.)
                     (roaring from the audience)
                 Terrible!

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

       WILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's 
       corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands 
       together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all 
       over the table. 
       We take a peak at the lines he has already written. 
       INSERT MANUSCRIPT: "But soft, what light through yonder 
       window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun." 
       VIOLA'S VOICE OVER speaks the line.

                           VIOLA (VO)
                 "But soft, what light through yonder 
                 window breaks? It is the east and 
                 Juliet is the sun!"

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

                           VIOLA
                     (reading)
                 "Arise fair sun and kill the envious 
                 moon Who is already sick and pale with 
                 grief That thou her maid art far more 
                 fair than she"

       VIOLA is in bed, reading the lines from the manuscript 
       page. WILL is in bed with her, reading with her.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 Oh, Will!

                           WILL
                 Yes, some of it is speakable.

       She has to speak through WILL'S kisses, he is nibbling at 
       her neck and shoulders and she has to bat him away with 
       the pages.

                           VIOLA
                     (continuing reading)
                 "It is my lady, O it is my love! O 
                 that she knew she were!"

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       VIOLA continues the speech, edge-to-edge, now in 
       rehearsal, with SAM as "JULIET" sighing on the balcony 
       above her.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "The brightness of her cheek would 
                 shame those stars As daylight doth a 
                 lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through 
                 the airy region stream so bright That 
                 birds would sing and think it were not 
                 night. See how she leans her cheek 
                 upon her hand. O that I were a glove 
                 upon that hand, That I might touch 
                 that cheek.

                           SAM AS JULIET
                     (above)
                 "Ay me."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "She speaks.

       Oh speak again bright angel"

       We have abandoned real time. The scene continues CROSS 
       CUT between the STAGE and VIOLA'S BED.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

                           WILL
                     (reading through VIOLA'S 
                      kisses)
                 "Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou 
                 Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy 
                 name."

                 love And I'll no longer be a Capulet."

                 this?"

       WILL and VIOLA in bed.

                           WILL
                 "What man art thou that thus 
                 bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my 
                 counsel?"

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. NIGHT.

       It's become late and the rehearsal is continuing by 
       torchlight.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "By a name I know not how to tell 
                 thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is 
                 hateful to myself Because it is an 
                 enemy to thee"

       We see that a group of the other actors have drifted "out 
       front," drawn by the scene. FENNYMAN is there entranced. 
       Clearly, this stuff is a cut above the normal.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

       WILL, undressed, strides around the room, feeding 
       "JULIET'S" lines to VIOLA in bed.

                           WILL
                 "The orchard walls are high and hard 
                 to climb, And the place death, 
                 considering who thou art, If any of my 
                 kinsmen find thee here. If they do see 
                 thee, they will murder thee."

                 "Alack, there lies more peril in thine 
                 eye, Than twenty of their swords! Look 
                 thou but sweet, And I am proof against 
                 their enmity."

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 I would not for the world!

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 I have night's cloak to hide me from 
                 their eyes; And but thou love me, let 
                 them find me here.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL and VIOLA are both out of bed, halfway though 
       dressing. Still rehearsing.

                           WILL
                 "Good night, good night. As sweet 
                 repose and rest Come to thy heart as 
                 that within my breast. O wilt thou 
                 leave me so unsatisfied?"

                           VIOLA
                 That's my line!

                 "What satisfaction can'st thou have 
                 tonight?"

                 "The exchange of thy love's faithful

       WILL and VIOLA are back on the bed, kissing and making 
       love.

                           WILL
                 "My bounty is as boundless as the sea,

       Outside the NURSE is knocking on the door and calling.

                 true."

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

                           WILL
                 "Stay but a little, I will come 
                 again."

       VIOLA slaps him playfully for his vulgarity, and then 
       kisses him.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Stay but a little, I will come 
                 again."

       SAM leaves the balcony through the curtain.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Oh blessed blessed night."

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       It is night. They have just made love. Suddenly it is 
       very still.

                           VIOLA
                     (almost to herself)
                 "I am feared,

       Being in night, all this but a dream, Too flattering-
       sweet to be substantial."

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       Onstage, the scene continues. Backstage NED ALLEYN is 
       working his way upstairs. He passes by RALPH (the Nurse) 
       who has a couple of words "of," as it were, in "JULIET'S" 
       chamber.

                           SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
                 "All my fortunes at thy foot I'll 
                 lay, And follow thee my lord 
                 throughout the world."

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Madam!"

                           SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
                 "I come, anon--But if thou meanest not 
                 well, I do beseech thee--"

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Madam!"

                           SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
                 By and by I come to cease thy strife 
                 and leave me to my grief. A thousand 
                 times good night!"

       SAM exits (i.e. enters to us) through the curtain.

                           SAM
                     (to NED)
                 I cannot move in this dress! and it 
                 makes me look like a pig! I have no 
                 neck in this pig dress!
                     (and then hearing his cue 
                      from "ROMEO")
                 Oh, she's off again! She says she's 
                 going and then she doesn't

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

       NED is arriving. WILL is busy writing. PETER is there, 
       holding the pages WILL has completed, and waiting for 
       WILL to finish his page. PETER is reading his pages. WILL 
       sees NED arrive. He gives his page to PETER.

                           WILL
                     (to PETER)
                 How is it?

                           PETER
                     (shrugs)
                 It's all right.

       Typical!, says WILL'S face. Peter departs, leaving the 
       field to NED. WILL braces himself.

                           WILL
                 NedI knowI know

                           ALLEYN
                 It's good.

                           WILL
                 Oh

                           ALLEYN
                 The title won't do.

                           WILL
                 Ah

                           ALLEYN
                 Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.

                           WILL
                 Thank you, Ned.

       The whole exchange is in ironic code, between old 
       soldiers. NED nods curtly and turns to descend.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 You are a gentleman.

                           ALLEYN
                 And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       PETER is just handing the pages HENSLOWE in the 
       auditorium. HENSLOWE has acquired a performing dog. The 
       dog does somersaults tirelessly. As PETER hands over the 
       pages, he shakes his head.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (in disbelief)
                 You mean, no dog of any kind?

       FENNYMAN, the born-again theatre groupie shushes HENSLOWE 
       and looks daggers at him.

                           PETER
                     (to HENSLOWE)
                 The Friar married them in secret, then 
                 Ned gets into a fight with one of the 
                 Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he 
                 gets in Ned's way, I mean in 
                 Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills 
                 Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt. 
                 Then the Prince banishes him from 
                 Verona.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (much relieved)
                 That must be when he goes on the 
                 voyage and gets shipwrecked on the 
                 island of the Pirate King.

       FENNYMAN can't hear it. He storms over. Kicks the dog, 
       roars at HENSLOWE .

                           FENNYMAN
                 Cease your prattling! Get out!
                     (to the stage where the 
                      action has paused)
                 A thousand apologies!

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Good night, good night. Parting is 
                 such sweet sorrow That I shall say 
                 good night till it be morrow."

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.

       A sunbeam wakes the lovers. Sunday morning. Church bells. 
       VIOLA wakes with a start. Something is bothering her, she 
       can't think what. WILL calms her.

                           WILL
                 Sundayit is Sunday.

       He brings her back down to the pillow.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 I found something in my sleep. The 
                 Friar who married them will take up 
                 their destinies.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, but it will end well for love?

                           WILL
                 In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy 
                 I am writing now. A broad river 
                 divides my lovers--family, duty, 
                 fate--as unchangeable as nature.

                           VIOLA
                     (sobered)
                 Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a 
                 stolen season.

       Suddenly there is a great racket heard from downstairsa 
       man shouting.

                           WESSEX (O.S.)
                 Not ready? Where is she?

                           NURSE (O.S.)
                 Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.

                           WESSEX (O.S.)
                 Will you ask Her Majesty to be 
                 patient?!

       VIOLA remembers. She jumps up and gives a cry.

                           VIOLA
                 Sunday! Greenwich!

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. 
       MORNING.

       The NURSE is barring the stairs to WESSEX.

                           WESSEX
                 Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen, 
                 Gloriana Regina, God's Chosen Vessel, 
                 the Radiant One, who shines her light 
                 on us, is at Greenwich today, and 
                 prepared, during the evening's 
                 festivities, to bestow her gracious 
                 favour on my choice of wife--and if 
                 we're late for lunch, the old boot 
                 will not forgive. So you get you to my 
                 lady's chamber and produce her with or 
                 without her undergarments.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.

       VIOLA has her dress on and is putting on her shoes. WILL, 
       in his underwear is in mid-argument.

                           WILL
                 You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!

                           VIOLA
                 What will you have me do? Marry you 
                 instead?

                           WILL
                     (brought up short)
                 To be the wife of a poor player?--can I 
                 wish that for Lady Viola, except in my 
                 dreams? And yet I would, if I were 
                 free to follow my desire in the harsh 
                 light of day.

                           VIOLA
                     (tartly)
                 You follow your desire freely enough 
                 in the night. So, if that is all, to 
                 Greenwich I go.

                           WILL
                 Then I will go with you.

                           VIOLA
                 You cannot, Wessex will kill you

                           WILL
                 I know how to fight!

                           VIOLA
                     (now fixing her hair)
                 Stage fighting!
                     (turn to him)
                 Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart 
                 belongs to you but as Viola the river 
                 divides us, and I will marry Wessex a 
                 week from Saturday.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM 
       DOWNSTAIRS HALL. MORNING.

       The ranting from WESSEX has continued

                           WESSEX
                     (ranting)
                 By heaven, I will drag her down, by 
                 the Queen's command

       And is cut off short as VIOLA'S door opens at the top of 
       the stairs.

                           VIOLA
                 Good morning, my lord!

                           WESSEX
                     (impressed by her appearance)
                 Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no 
                 man, but I swear it would wait for 
                 you!

       VIOLA comes down the stairs. Behind her WILL appears 
       gowned and bonneted. He has also assumed a country 
       accent.

                           WILL
                 Here we come at last, my lord!

                           WESSEX
                     (taken aback)
                 Are you bringing your laundry woman?

                           WILL
                 Her chaperone. My lady's country 
                 cousin.
                     (arriving with a curtsey)
                 My, but you be a handsome gallant, 
                 just as she said! You may call me Miss 
                 Wilhelmina!

                           WESSEX
                 On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps

                           WILL
                 Oh, my lord, you will not shake me 
                 off, she never needed me more, I sear 
                 by your breeches!

       EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. NIGHT.

       Fireworks explode in the evening sky over Greenwich, a 
       royal palace, crowded now with noble guests.

       EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. TERRACE. NIGHT.

       The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about, 
       chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while 
       QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes 
       through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with 
       a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the 
       best chairwhere she establishes a headquarters. Her 
       current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to 
       a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the 
       next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and 
       bowing as they are greeted by people who know themWill, 
       in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until 
       VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The 
       QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve.

                           WESSEX
                     (to him)
                 Now?

                           LORD IN WAITING
                 Now.

                           WESSEX
                     (to Viola)
                 The Queen asks for you. Answer well.

       The LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL 
       starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 Is there a man?

                           WILL
                 A man, my lord?

                           WESSEX
                     (impatiently)
                 There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, 
                 I heard--does he come to the house?

                           WILL
                 A theatre poet?

                           WESSEX
                 An insolent penny-a-page rogue, 
                 Marlowe, he said, Christopher 
                 Marlowe--has he been to the house?

                           WILL
                 Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely 
                 waistcoat, shame about the poetry.

                           WESSEX
                     (venomously)
                 That dog!

       ANGLE on the QUEEN.

       The LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks 
       from a frozen curtsey.

                           VIOLA
                 Your Majesty.

                           QUEEN
                 Stand up straight, girl.

       VIOLA straightens. The QUEEN examines her.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 I have seen you. You are the one who 
                 comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, 
                 at Richmond.

                           VIOLA
                     (agreeing)
                 Your Majesty.

                           QUEEN
                 What do you love so much?

                           VIOLA
                 Your Majesty

                           QUEEN
                 Speak out! I know who I am. Do you 
                 love stories of kings and queens? 
                 Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?

                           VIOLA
                 I love theatre. To have stories acted 
                 for me by a company of fellows is 
                 indeed

                           QUEEN
                     (interrupting)
                 They are not acted for you, they are 
                 acted for me.

       VIOLA remains silent, in apology.

       ANGLE on WILL.

       He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN 
       so close. He is fascinated.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 And--?

                           VIOLA
                 And I love poetry above all.

                           QUEEN
                 Above Lord Wessex?

       She looks over VIOLA'S shoulder and VIOLA realises WESSEX 
       has moved up behind her. WESSEX bows.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                     (to WESSEX)
                 My Lord--when you cannot find your wife 
                 you had better look for her at the 
                 playhouse.

       The COURTIERS titter at her pleasantry.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 But playwrights teach nothing about 
                 love, they make it pretty, they make 
                 it comical, or they make it lust. They 
                 cannot make it true.

                           VIOLA
                     (blurts)
                 Oh, but they can!

       She has forgotten herself. The COURTIERS gasp. The QUEEN 
       considers her. WESSEX looks furious. WILL is touched.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they 
                 have not, but I believe there is one 
                 who can

                           WESSEX
                 Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your 
                 Majesty is wise in it. 
                 Nature and truth are the very enemies 
                 of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

                           QUEEN
                 I thought you were here because you 
                 had none.

       Titters again. WESSEX could kill somebody.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                     (by way of dismissing him)
                 Well, no one will take your wager, it 
                 seems.

                           WILL
                 Fifty pounds!

       Shock and horror. QUEEN ELIZABETH is the only person 
       amused.

                           QUEEN
                 Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a 
                 very worthy question. Can a play show 
                 us the very truth and nature of love? 
                 I bear witness to the wager, and will 
                 be the judge of it as occasion arises.
                     (which wins a scatter of 
                      applause. She gathers her 
                      skirts and stands)
                 I have not seen anything to settle it 
                 yet.
                     (she moves away, everybody 
                      bowing and scraping)
                 So--the fireworks will be soothing 
                 after the excitements of Lady Viola's 
                 audience.
                     (and now she is next to 
                      WESSEX who is bowing low. 
                      Intimately to him)
                 Have her then, but you are a lordly 
                 fool. She has been plucked since I saw 
                 her last, and not by you. It takes a 
                 woman to know it.

       The QUEEN passes by, and as WESSEX comes vertical again, 
       we see his face a mask of furious realisation.

                           WESSEX
                     (to himself)
                 Marlowe!

       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. ENTRANCE. DAY.

       CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE shuts the door behind him. Above him, 
       the ceiling creaks to the rhythm of copulation. He has a 
       sheaf of manuscript pages in his hand. He goes to the 
       stairs.

                           MARLOWE
                 Burbage!

       The creaking stops.

                           BURBAGE'S VOICE
                 Who's there?

       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. STAIRS. DAY.

       MARLOWE ascends.

                           MARLOWE
                 Marlowe.

                           BURBAGE'S VOICE
                 Kit!

       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY.

       MARLOWE enters, ignoring the situation on the bed where 
       ROSALINE is astride BURBAGE.

                           MARLOWE
                 You are playing my Faustus this 
                 afternoon. Don't spend yourself in 
                 sport.

                           ROSALINE
                     (working hard)
                 This afternoon!--we'll still be here 
                 this afternoon.

                           BURBAGE
                 What do you want, Kit?

                           MARLOWE
                 My Massacre at Paris is complete.

                           BURBAGE
                 You have the last act?

                           MARLOWE
                 You have the money?

                           BURBAGE
                 Tomorrow.

                           MARLOWE
                     (leaving)
                 Then tomorrow you will have the pages.

                           BURBAGE
                 Wait!
                     (to ROSALINE)
                 Will you desist!

                           MARLOWE
                 Twenty pounds on delivery

                           BURBAGE
                 What is money to me like us? Besides, 
                 if I need a play, I have another 
                 waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.

                           MARLOWE
                 Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.

                           BURBAGE
                 Never!

                           MARLOWE
                 Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my 
                 respects, Miss Rosaline.

                           BURBAGE
                 I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for 
                 Romeo!

                           MARLOWE
                     (leaving)
                 You did. But Ned Alleyn and the 
                 Admiral's Men have the playing of it 
                 as the Rose.

                           BURBAGE
                 Treachery!

       BURBAGE rouses himself violently, throwing ROSALINE off 
       the bed. The glass bracelet is flung from her wrist. It 
       breaks on the floor, releasing a strip of paper. BURBAGE 
       picks it up. What he reads on it does not please him: it 
       is WILL'S signature.

                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                 Traitor and thief!

       EXT. STREETS. DAY.

       BURBAGE and a solid wedge of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEND are 
       cleaving a path through the crowds. Their faces are grim.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM/UNDER THE STAGE. 
       DAY.

       We are in Act III Scene I. NED ALLEYN as "MERCUTIO" and 
       NOL as "BENVOLIO", and two "MONTAGUE" sidekicks are in 
       occupation of the stage, when the "CAPULETS" swagger in, 
       four of them headed by JAMES HEMMINGS as "TYBALT."

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 "By my head, here comes the Capulets."

                           ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO
                 "By my heel, I care not."

                           JAMES HEMMINGS AS TYBALT
                 "Follow me close, for I will speak to 
                 them. (with bombast to "MERCUTIO") 
                 Gentlemen, good e'en: a word with one 
                 of you."

       NED comes out of character.

                           ALLEYN
                 Are you going to do it like that? And 
                 before the humbled actor can reply NED 
                 continues.

                           ALLEYN (AS MECUTIO)
                 And but one word with one of us? 
                 Couple it with something, make it a 
                 word and a blow.

       But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, 
       ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have 
       arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs, 
       and a bucket (containing pig swill).

                           BURBAGE
                 Where is that thieving hack who can't 
                 keep his pen in his own ink pot!?

       WILL has already leapt up onto the stage.

                           WILL
                 What is this rabble?!

       BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave 
       from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. 
       He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL, 
       THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings 
       bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S 
       MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed 
       skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using 
       everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is 
       yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE, 
       a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the 
       page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up, 
       watches enthralled.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (to HENSLOWE)
                 Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!

       But now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't 
       belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his 
       interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is 
       using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one 
       of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH

                           HENSLOWE
                 Not with my props!

       VIOLA is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a 
       well-judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow 
       aimed at WILL

                           VIOLA
                 Will! What--?

                           WILL
                 A literary feud. Quite normal.

       Then he is smashed over the head. He falls off the stage 
       taking VIOLA with him. Under the stage is a space (known 
       as Hell) and WILL shoves VIOLA into this space.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Stay hid!

       He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are 
       worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, 
       with SAM GOSSE, dressed as "JULIET," fighting with the 
       best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for 
       the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED 
       ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon 
       cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying 
       feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head 
       pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs 
       and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and 
       half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover 
       blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just 
       nicely for Will to plummet down it.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.

                           WILL
                 I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. 
                 You were cast ashore in a far country.

       They embrace and kiss. In a moment they are in a world of 
       their own.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.

       The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium, 
       continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's 
       ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd 
       props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks 
       up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells.

                           HENSLOWE
                 We need that for the balcony scene!

       FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He 
       looks around the realises that some of these faces are 
       unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head. 
       FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                     (in despair)
                 My poor Rose!

       He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to 
       him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults 
       them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that 
       this scene is not in them.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (horrified)
                 My investment! LAMBERT!!!

       LAMBERT has been sleeping peacefully through this, but 
       wakes to his master's call.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                     (points at the fray)
                 VENGEANCE!

       HENSLOWE attempts to intervene.

                           HENSLOWE
                 I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. 
                 As I explained to you, the theatre 
                 business

                           FENNYMAN
                 Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my 
                 business I would be out of business if 
                 I had your courage, so don't tell me 
                 about business

       And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S 
       MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is 
       making short work of the rest of the opposition, 
       receiving help with the thorny business of identification 
       from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are 
       running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic 
       last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage 
       and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts 
       applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start 
       applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN 
       looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and 
       bravos engulf him. A star!

       INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

       The victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel, 
       FENNYMAN at their head. He owns the brothel. The place is 
       already crowded with WHORES and CUSTOMERS. It's a party.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (shouts)
                 A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open 
                 and on the house! Oh what happy hour!
                     (and grabbing a RADDLED 
                      WHORE)
                 Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to 
                 yourself I'll not have you infecting 
                 my investment!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (looking around guardedly. To 
                      WILL)
                 Is this a tavern?

                           WILL
                 It is also a tavern.

       WILL sits her down in THE COMPANY and takes the chair 
       next to her A PRETTY WHORE immediately sits on WILL'S 
       knee and kisses him.

                           PRETTY WHORE
                 I remember you! The poet!

       VIOLA furiously pulls the PRETTY WHORE off WILL'S lap.

                           PRETTY WHORE (CONT'D)
                 One at a time, one at a time!

                           SECOND WHORE
                     (to VIOLA)
                 Oh, he's a pretty one! Tell me your 
                 story while I tickle your fancy!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill-
                 repute!

                           WILL
                 It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. 
                 Come, there is no harm in a drink.

       Glasses are shoved into their hands. Everyone has a 
       glass. Except RALPH

                           RALPH
                     (declining the glass)
                 Never when I'm working!

       The PRETTY WHORE has turned her attention to SAM. SAM 
       looks uncomfortable

                           PRETTY WHORE
                 Never tried it? Never?
                     (groping him)
                 I think you are ready, Sam!

       FENNYMAN shouts a toast.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (raising his glass)
                 You are welcome to my best house! 
                 Here's to the Admiral's Men!

       Everybody drinks. VIOLA drinks too. She decides too. She 
       decides to enjoy it. She bangs down her glass.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (shouts)
                 The Admiral's Men!

       WILL toasts with her. He sees that she feels one of THE 
       COMPANY.

       EXT. STREET. NIGHT.

       A figure is running desperately through the streets. He 
       comes into the square and runs towards the Rose.

       EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

       Half THE COMPANY are singing. NOL and a WHORE are 
       tumbling down the stairs together. He is without his 
       trousers. An awful lot of drink has gone down.

                           SAM
                     (to the PRETTIEST WHORE)
                 Iquite liked it.

       VIOLA, bright eyed, is banging her glass on the table in 
       time to a song which is being drunkenly delivered by a 
       barbershop quartet of actors.

       FENNYMAN reels into VIOLA.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Master Kent! You have not dipped your 
                 wick?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (baffled)
                 My wick?

                           WILL
                     (saving her)
                 Mr. Fennyman, because you love the 
                 theatre you must have a part in my 
                 play. I am writing an Apothecary, a 
                 small but vital role.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (embracing WILL)
                 By heaven, I thank you! I will be your 
                 Apothecary!

       In his general enthusiasm, he embraces the next man, who 
       is RALPH, stone cold sober.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 I am to be in your play.

                           WHORE
                     (to RALPH)
                 And what is this play about?

                           RALPH
                 Well, there's this Nurse

       FENNYMAN, beside himself, shouts for silence, announcing

                           FENNYMAN
                 Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part 
                 of the Apothecary!

                           HENSLOWE
                 The Apothecary? Will, what is the 
                 story? Where is the shipwreck? How 
                 does the comedy end?

                           WILL
                 By God, I wish I knew.

                           HENSLOWE
                 By God, Will, if you do not, who does? 
                 Let us have pirates, clowns, and a 
                 happy ending, or we will send you back 
                 to Stratford to your wife!

       That goes down every well with the entire COMPANYexcept 
       for VIOLA and WILL. He looks at her, helplessly, then 
       makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him 
       and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears. 
       VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street. 
       WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the 
       shoulders by PETERwho, we now see, is in a highly 
       emotional state. WILL tries to fight him off but PETER 
       has the strength of the news he brings.

                           PETER
                     (shouts)
                 Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

       He brings the room to silence.

                           PETER (CONT'D)
                 A black day for us all! There is news 
                 come up river from Deptford. Marlowe 
                 is dead.

       There are general gasps and cries for information.

                           PETER (CONT'D)
                 Stabbed! Stabbed to death in a tavern 
                 at Deptford!

       No one is more affected than WILL. This second blow is 
       worse than the first. He stands horror-stricken.

                           WILL
                 Ohwhat have I done?

                           ALLEYN
                     (standing up)
                 He was the first man among us. A great 
                 light has gone out.

       EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

       WILL comes staggering out into the street.

                           WILL
                 It was I who killed him! God forgive 
                 me, God forgive me!

       He falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water 
       and garbage. He gets up and staggers on.

       EXT. CHURCH TOWER. NIGHT.

       A church tower looms up in the night sky.

       INT. CHURCH. NIGHT.

       This is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for 
       the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling, 
       praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private 
       purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by 
       effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is 
       wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

       A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing. 
       VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides 
       sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather 
       like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive 
       animal. 

       Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a 
       happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily. 
       Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA 
       and greets her merrily.

                           WESSEX
                 You look sad, my lady! Let me take you 
                 riding.

                           VIOLA
                 It is not my riding day, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

                           VIOLA
                 I am going to church.

                           WESSEX
                     (recomposing his features to 
                      solemnity)
                 I understand of course. It is to be 
                 expected.

                           VIOLA
                 It is to be expected on a Sunday.

                           WESSEX
                 And on a day of mourning. I never met 
                 the fellow but once at your house.

                           VIOLA
                     (cannot take this in)
                 Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?

                           WESSEX
                 Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would 
                 be me to tell you. A great loss to 
                 playwriting, and to dancing.

       VIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her.

                           VIOLA
                     (faintly)
                 He is dead?

                           WESSEX
                     (cheerfully solemn)
                 Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, 
                 then, we'll say a prayer for his soul

       VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in 
       distress.

                           NURSE
                 My ladymy ladynow is the time to 
                 show your breeding.

       INT. CHURCH. DAY.

       The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church. 
       VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat 
       and sits down next to her. 

       As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is 
       sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. 
       He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns 
       him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE.

       ANGLE on WILL. 

       WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great 
       shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of 
       times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has 
       banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he 
       stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX. 

       WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering 
       accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to 
       mumble.

                           WESSEX
                 Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for 
                 the love of Christ!

       Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at 
       first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment 
       as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally 
       running in terror.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                     (screaming)
                 Spare me!

       The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA 
       to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is 
       leaving.

       EXT. CHURCH. DAY.

       Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the 
       church. She calls his name.

                           VIOLA
                 Will!

       He does not answer. She runs after him.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!

       She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment 
       then WILL pulls back.

                           WILL
                 It is worse. I have killed a man.

       EXT. MEADOW. DAY.

       VIOLA'S horse grazes. WILL lies on his back, still 
       sobered and full of guilt. VIOLA sits on the grass among 
       the buttercups and looks down at him. 
       VIOLA is plaiting a finger-ring from stems of grass. She 
       has not yet revealed her feelings.

                           WILL
                 Marlowe's touch was in my Titus 
                 Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house 
                 built on his foundations.

                           VIOLA
                 You never spoke so well of him.

                           WILL
                 He was not dead before. I would 
                 exchange all my plays to come for all 
                 of his that will never come.

                           VIOLA
                 You lie.

       WILL turns to look at her.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 You lie in your meadow as you lied in 
                 my bed.

                           WILL
                 My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, 
                 and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir 
                 Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife 
                 come from Stratford to tell you that. 
                 And yet you let me come to your bed.

                           VIOLA
                 Calf love. I loved the writer, and 
                 gave up the prize for a sonnet.

                           WILL
                 I was the more deceived.

                           VOILA
                 Yes--you were deceived. For I never 
                 loved you till now.

                           WILL
                 Now?

                           VIOLA
                     (declaring herself)
                 I love you, Will, beyond poetry.

                           WILL
                 Oh, my love
                     (he kisses her)
                 You ran from me before.

                           VIOLA
                 You were not dead before. When I 
                 thought you dead, I did not care about 
                 all the plays that will never come, 
                 only that I would never see your face. 
                 I saw our end, and it will come.

                           WILL
                 You cannot marry Wessex!

                           VIOLA
                 If not Wessex the Queen will know the 
                 cause and there will be no more Will 
                 Shakespeare.

       They kiss again, passionately.

                           WILL
                 Nono.

                           VIOLA
                     (through his kisses)
                 But I will go to Wessex as a widow 
                 from these vows, as solemn as they are 
                 unsanctified.

       And as their desperate kisses turn into lovemaking we cut 
       to:

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

                           WILL
                     (he is mid speech)
                 For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, 
                 the one who killed Romeo's friend 
                 Mercutio, Romeo is banished

       He is on the stage of the Rose. The entire COMPANY is 
       assembled, HENSLOWE and FENNYMAN included, holding pages 
       of manuscript, which they are sharing together, examining 
       the separated pages, passing pages to each other, etc. 
       WILL'S mood is intense and focused.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 but the Friar who married Romeo and 
                 Juliet

                           ACTOR (EDWARD)
                 Is that me. Will?

                           WILL
                 You, Edward. The Friar who married 
                 them gives Juliet a potion to drink. 
                 It is a secret potion. It makes her 
                 seeming dead. She is placed in the 
                 tomb of the Capulets. She will awake 
                 to life and love when Romeo comes to 
                 her side again.

       THE COMPANY murmurs approval.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 I have not said all. By malign fate, 
                 the message goes astray which would 
                 tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He 
                 hears only that Juliet is dead. And 
                 thus he goes to the Apothecary.

                           FENNYMAN
                 That's me.

                           WILL
                 And buys a deadly poison. He enters 
                 the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who 
                 lies there cold as death. He drinks 
                 the poison. He dies by her side. And 
                 then she wakes and sees him dead.

       HENSLOWE is fascinated and appalled.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 And so Juliet takes his dagger and 
                 kills herself.

       PAUSE.

       WILL is staring at VIOLA

                           HENSLOWE
                 Well, that will have them rolling in 
                 the aisles.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Sad and wonderful! I have a blue 
                 velvet cap which will do well, I have 
                 seen apothecary with a cap just so.

                           ALLEYN
                     (to WILL)
                 Yes--it will serve. But there's a scene 
                 missing between marriage and death.

       WILL is still staring at VIOLA. Aware, suddenly, of the 
       others watching, she breaks his gaze and drops her head. 
       WILL looks at NED.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

       WILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present 
       for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on 
       sheets folded to octavo size.

                           WILL
                 The play. All written out for you. I 
                 had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he 
                 has a good fist for lettering.

       She wants to accept the present with joy, but something 
       in his mood restrains her.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 There's a new scene

       He turns the pages and shows her.

                           VIOLA
                 Will you read it for me?

                           WILL
                     (he knows it)
                 "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near 
                 day> It was the nightingale and not 
                 the lark That pierced the fearful 
                 hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings 
                 on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, 
                 love, it was the nightingale."

                           VIOLA
                     (reading)
                 "It was the lark, the herald of the 
                 morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what 
                 envious streaks Do lace the severing 
                 clouds in yonder east. Night's candles 
                 are burnt out, and jocund day Stands 
                 tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I 
                 must be gone and live, or stay and 
                 die."

       The words of the scene become WILL'S and VIOLA'S, their 
       way of saying the farewells they cannot utter.

                           WILL
                 "Yon light is not daylight, I know it, 
                 I. It is some meteor that the sun 
                 exhales To be to thee this night a 
                 torchbearer"

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       But the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as 
       "THOMAS." Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a 
       deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc., 
       they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether 
       it is rehearsal or lovemaking. But after a few moments it 
       is definitely lovemaking. Their clothes start coming 
       away, their words interrupted by kisses.

                           WILL
                 "thou need'st not to be gone."

                           VIOLA
                 "I have more care to stay than will to 
                 go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet 
                 wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's 
                 talk. It is not day."

       By now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away 
       and WILL passionately embraces her nakedness. 

       And into this heaving composition comes a little white 
       mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in 
       the planking behind VIOLA'S head. 

       An adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not 
       need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S. 

       WEBSTER takes his eye away from the peephole, and frowns, 
       thinking it out.

       EXT. ALLEWAY. DAY.

       TILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand.

                           TILNEY
                 You will go far, I fear.

                           TILNEY (CONT'D)
                 I hope we work together again. Tilney 
                 walks away.

       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

       A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is 
       muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is 
       FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary, 
       for which he has a special voice.

                           FENNYMAN
                 "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's 
                 law Is death to any he that utters 
                 them." Then him. Then me.

       "Put this in any liquid thing you will And"--something

       He has dried up. He curses--the terror and despair.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 "Such mortal drugs I have" What is 
                 it? What is it?

       He is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not 
       notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance 
       dismounts and walks inside.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       Onstage, the rehearsal continues. WESSEX strides in. 
       Among the audience are HENSLOWE, a few actorsand JOHN 
       WEBSTERwho sees WESSEX and jumps up and goes to him.

                           WEBSTER
                 My lord!

       WESSEX knocks him aside and continues.

                           WESSEX
                     (shouts)
                 Shakespeare!

       Everything stops.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 You upstart inky pup! Now I will show 
                 you your place, which is in hell!

                           WILL
                 You are on my ground.

                           WESSEX
                     (drawing his sword)
                 By God, I'll fight the lot of you

       WILL draws his sword.

                           WILL
                 I am more than enough.

       VIOLA reacts. She almost gives herself away. But the 
       fight has started. 

       WESSEX slashes at WILL. WILL knows how to fight. He 
       parries and thrusts. WESSEX is surprised. The fight goes 
       fast and furious around the stage, until WILL thrusts 
       accurately at WESSEX'S chestand would have killed him 
       but for the button on his sword-point. 

       WESSEX grapples with him, and now it becomes a parody of 
       the Hamlet duel; WESSEX'S unbuttoned sword falls to the 
       ground, WILL puts his foot on it, tosses WESSEX his own 
       safe sword, picks up Wessex's sword and continues the 
       fight until he has WESSEX at his mercy. 

       WILL has fought with a passionate rage that has everybody 
       staring at him. Now the look in his eyes is merciless.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Absent friends!
                     (to the assembly)
                 This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

       NED ALLEYN comes forward looking worried and dubious.

                           ALLEYN
                 Will

                           WESSEX
                 I rejoiced at his death because I 
                 thought it was yours. That is all I 
                 know of Marlowe.

                           ALLEYN
                 It's true, Will--it was a tavern 
                 brawlMarlowe attacked, and got his 
                 own knife in the eye. A quarrel about 
                 the bill

                           HENSLOWE
                 The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity!

                           ALLEYN
                 Not the billing, the bill!

       WILL steps back, and sinks to his knees. His relief could 
       not be greater.

                           WILL
                     (to the heavens)
                 Oh God, I am free of it!

       WESSEX gets to his feet. TILNEY enters the auditorium 
       from the public entrance.

                           WESSEX
                 Close it!

                           TILNEY
                 My Lord Wessex!

                           WESSEX
                     (foaming)
                 Close it! Take it down stone by stone! 
                 I want it ploughed into the ground, 
                 and sown with quick lime!

       WESSEX storms out past the bewildered TILNEY.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Mr. Tilney, what is this?

                           TILNEY
                 Sedition and indecency!

                           HENSLOWE
                 What?!

                           WEBSTER
                 Master of the Revels, sir, over here, 
                 sir.

                           TILNEY
                     (to WEBSTER)
                 Where, boy?

                           WEBSTER
                     (points)
                 I saw her bubbies!

                           TILNEY
                     (shocked and gratified)
                 A woman on the stage? A woman?

                           WEBSTER
                 I swear it!

       THE COMPANY of actors are dumbstruck. None more than 
       VIOLA.

                           TILNEY
                 So, Henslowe! I say this theatre is 
                 closed! On the authority of the powers 
                 invested in my by the court--I close 
                 this theatre!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Why so?

                           TILNEY
                     (triumphantly)
                 For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For 
                 displaying a female on the public 
                 stage!

       TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stageand seizes 
       SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY 
       pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell 
       of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers. 

       TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER 
       rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly 
       throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair. VIOLA gives a 
       shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via 
       VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which 
       time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her 
       hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender. 
       WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible 
       despair and apology.

                           WEBSTER
                     (pointing at SAM)
                 Not him.
                     (pointing at VIOLA)
                 her.

                           HENSLOWE
                 He's a woman!

       By now the scene is playing to a crowded theatre, or so 
       it seems.

                           TILNEY
                 That's who I meant! This theatre is 
                 closed! Notice will be posted!

       SAM has picked himself up, and his drawers.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (to NED)
                 Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!

                           VIOLA
                     (hoping to protect WILL)
                 Nobody knew!

                           WEBSTER
                     (pointing at WILL)
                 He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies!

       Everybody looks at WILL, who stares at VIOLA, helpless.

                           TILNEY
                 Closed! Closed, mark you, Henslowe!

       TILNEY turns on his heel and leaves in triumph. THE 
       COMPANY is still polaxed.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (in despair)
                 It is over.

                           VIOLA
                 I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted 
                 to be an actor.
                     (she turns to WILL)
                 I am sorry, Will.

       WILL shakes his head. This cannot be the end. VIOLA walks 
       away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her 
       go, watching her silently. As she passes WABASH

                           WABASH
                 Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w-
                 wonderful.

                           VIOLA
                 Thank you.

       As she is leaving, WILL comes to life. He starts off 
       towards herbut his progress is halted by a sock to the 
       jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust. 
       FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper, 
       mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the 
       groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole 
       COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or 
       worse. FENNYMAN looks around.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Everything all right?

       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. EVENING.

       The closure notice is nailed to the door.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       VIOLA, in her nightdress, is reading by candlelight. She 
       is reading her private manuscript of Romeo and Julietand 
       rereading. Next to her is a tray of covered dishes. the 
       NURSE enters and looks at her sympathetically. She lifts 
       the tray. She realises it is heavy. She puts it down and 
       raises the covers and sees that VIOLA has eaten nothing. 

       She looks at VIOLA'S tears, but there is nothing to be 
       said.

       INT. TAVERN. DAY.

       They are all there--the ADMIRAL'S MEN, including WILL and 
       HENSLOWE, drowning their sorrows. Everyone is drunk. 
       FENNYMAN is also there, taking the disaster somewhat 
       selfishly.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (muttering)
                 I would have been goodI would have 
                 been great.

       He hands a flask to RALPH who is in a similar mood.

                           RALPH
                 So would I. We both would.

       RALPH contemplates the flask, and, since he's not 
       working, takes a swig. A moment later, he keels over, 
       rigid as a pole. The street door crashes open. BURBAGE 
       enters. Behind him enter a solid wedge of the 
       CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, sober-faced, several with black eyes 
       and bandages round their heads.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (shouts)
                 Lambert!

       LAMBERT, FENNYMAN'S henchman and killer, puts down his 
       tankard and comes forward, casually kicking chairs and 
       tables out of his way.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 Kill him!

       LAMBERT reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes 
       down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there--a 
       battle-axe. 

       But BURBAGE has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash. 
       BURBAGE draws and the pistol roars, shooting flame, 
       LAMBERT curses, drops the axe, nurses his wounded hand. 
       BURBAGE puts the pistol back into his sash. NED ALLEYN is 
       half-drunk at a table. He staggers to his feet. He faces 
       BURBAGE.

                           ALLEYN
                 Well, Burbage--you never did know when 
                 your scene was over.

                           BURBAGE
                 That can wait. The Master of the 
                 Revels despises us for vagrants, 
                 tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But 
                 my father, James Burbage, had the 
                 first licence to make a company of 
                 players from Her Majesty, and he drew 
                 from poets the literature of the age. 
                 Their fame will be our fame. So let 
                 them all know, we are men of parts. We 
                 are a brotherhood, and we will be a 
                 profession. Will Shakespeare has a 
                 play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is 
                 yours.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       A strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a 
       paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble 
       pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of 
       wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen 
       flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot 
       runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at 
       the poster. It says

                           BY PERMISSION OF
                 MR. BURBAGE
                 A
                 HUGH FENNYMAN PRODUCTION
                 OF
                 MR. HENSLOWE'S PRESENTATION
                 OF
                 THE ADMIRAL'S MEN IN PERFORMANCE
                 OF
                 THE EXCELLENT AND LAMENTABLE TRAGEDY
                 OF
                 ROMEO AND JULIET
                 with Mr. Fennyman as the Apothecary

       WILL comes out of the theatre, and passes the poster. He 
       walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him:

                           HENSLOWE
                 Will!

       WILL does not turn to look at him.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                 We'll be needing a Romeo

       WILL carries on walking.

       EXT. STREETS. DAY.

       WILL is pushing through the crowds on his way to the 
       river.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.

       The NURSE is helping VIOLA to dress--in a wedding dress. 
       The NURSE is in tears. VIOLA submits to the task 
       impassively.

       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

       WILL is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. DAY.

       WESSEX, dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his 
       negotiations with DE LESSEPS, while LADY DE LESSEPS 
       weeps. DE LESSEPS is signing papers. There is a money 
       chest, too.

                           WESSEX
                 My ship is moored at Bankside, bound 
                 for Virginia on the afternoon 
                 tide--please do not weep, Lady De 
                 Lesseps, you are gaining a colony.

                           DE LESSEPS
                 And you are gaining five thousand 
                 pounds, my lordby these drafts in my 
                 hand.

                           WESSEX
                 Would you oblige me with fifty or so 
                 in gold?--just to settle my accounts at 
                 the dockside?

       DE LESSEPS sighs and unlocks his money chest. WESSEX 
       places his empty purse on the desk.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 Ah!--Look, she comes!

       VIOLA has appeared at the top of the stairs with the 
       NURSE.

                           VIOLA
                 Good morning, my lord. I see you are 
                 open for business so let's to church.

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL is running across the grass towards the house. As he 
       crosses the bridge over the moat, a carriage bears down 
       on him, and he has to flatten himself against the wall of 
       the gatehouse as the carriage passes, taking WESSEX and 
       his bride to church. WILL'S face, as he watches the 
       carriage disappear. Distant bells begin to peal

       EXT. CHURCH DOOR. DAY.

       The bells announce the completion of the marriage--as 
       WESSEX and the new LADY WESSEX leave the church. VIOLA'S 
       veil is flying in the wind, and beneath it we can just 
       see VIOLA'S unhappy face. The DE LESSEPS FAMILY entourage 
       is applauding. WESSEX beams with satisfaction. 

       Suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message--a flyer 
       from the Curtain slaps against WESSEX'S face. He claws at 
       it and tries to throw it away. The wind delivers it to 
       VIOLA'S bosom. She takes it up and reads it. And passes 
       it to the NURSE. 

       WESSEX descends the steps to where the curtained carriage 
       awaits the bride and groom. He gallantly holds the door 
       for VIOLA to enter. She climbs aboard. WESSEX makes to 
       follow her.

                           NURSE
                 My lord!

       The NURSE grasps him in a moving embrace, to WESSEX'S 
       discomfort.

                           NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Be good to her, my lord!

                           WESSEX
                 I will.

       He tries to disengage. She won't have it.

                           NURSE
                 God bless you!

                           WESSEX
                 Thank you. Let go, there's a good 
                 nurse.

       After a couple of further attempts, WESSEX extricates 
       himself.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 The tide will not wait. Farewell!

       WESSEX pulls aside the curtain and gets in.

       INT. CARRIAGE. DAY.

       It takes a moment for WESSEX to realise he is alone in 
       there. He looks around but VIOLA has fled.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       Hundreds of people are converging on the theatre. Among 
       them is the Puritan MAKEPEACE, vainly exhorting the 
       crowds to run away from sin

                           MAKEPEACE
                 Licentiousness is made a show, vice is 
                 made a show, vanity and pride likewise 
                 made a show! This is the very business 
                 of show

       But MAKEPEACE is being carried inexorably through the 
       main doors of the theatre.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       The ADMIRAL'S MEN are all in costume, and are in a buzz 
       of nervous excitement. ALLEYN, dressed for "MERCUTIO," is 
       giving last minute instructions to PETER. JAMES and JOHN 
       HEMMINGS are arguing about the timing of their entrance. 
       FENNYMAN in his apothecary's cap is agonising over his 
       lines. WABASH is stuttering over his. Alone in his 
       dejection in the midst of all this, is WILL, dressed for

                           "ROMEO."
                 FENNYMAN approaches him, apothecary's 
                 cap in hand.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Is this all right?

       WILL nods, miserable. SAM has found a private corner. He 
       is gargling into a basin. He looks worried and furtive.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       The audience is gathering.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       Word has got around. Even rich people are coming. They 
       arrive by carriage and by palanquin. 
       Some of them are cloaked and hooded, slumming incognito. 
       A cannon booms from the Curtain. The flag of the 
       ADMIRAL'S MEN flutters above.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. ENTRANCE. DAY.

       LAMBERT and FREES are taking the entrance money.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       The auditorium is now packed. Among them, sheepish, is 
       MAKEPEACE.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       Everything is ready. NED signals the musicians. Trumpets 
       and drums sound. The house falls silent.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

       WABASH seems to be important at the beginning. We have 
       never been told what part he plays. He is still muttering 
       lines and stuttering them.

                           WABASH
                     (mutter)
                 T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike 
                 in d-d-d-dignity.

       WILL listens to him in agony. He finds HENSLOWE next to 
       him.

                           WILL
                     (to HENSLOWE)
                 We are lost.

                           HENSLOWE
                 No, it will turn out well.

                           WILL
                 How will it?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I don't know, it's a mystery.

       And off we go. HENSLOWE claps WABASH on the shoulder and 
       sends him through the curtain.

       ANGLE on WABASH

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       The audience waits expectantly. WABASH gathers himself.

                           WABASH AS THE CHORUS
                 T-t-t-t-two

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       WILL shuts his eyes and prays.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       WABASH launches himself into a perfect audacious delivery 
       like a star.

                           WABASH AS THE CHORUS
                 "Household both alike in dignity (in 
                 fair Verona where we lay our scene) 
                 From ancient grudge break to new 
                 mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil 
                 hands unclean. From forth the fatal 
                 loins of these two foes A pair of star-
                 cross'd lovers take their life, Whose 
                 misadventured piteous overthrows Doth 
                 with their death bury their parents' 
                 strife"

       EXT. STREET. DAY.

       VIOLA and the NURSE, hurrying toward the Curtain.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       HEMMINGS BROTHERS are ready to go on as "SAMPSON" and 
       "GROCERY," Act I Scene I. They shake hands. Beyond the 
       curtain, the audience applauds the Prologue as WABASH 
       comes through the curtain backstage.

                           WILL
                     (to WABASH)
                 Wonderful!

                           WABASH
                 W-w-w-was it g-g-g-good?

       The HEMMINGS BROTHERS enter the arena and the play 
       begins.

       POV: from THE WINGS:

                           JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON
                 "Gregory, on my word we'll not carry 
                 coals."

                           JAMES HEMMINGS AS GREGORY
                 "No, for then we should be colliers." 
                 WILL looks as if he would rather be 
                 dead. SAM GOSSE approaches WILL, 
                 nervously.

                           SAM
                     (nervously--in a deep bass 
                      guttural hoarse voice)
                 Master Shakespeare

                           WILL
                     (absently)
                 Luck be with you, Sam.
                     (as the awful truth gets 
                      through to him)
                 Sam?

                           SAM
                     (in the same voice)
                 It is not my fault, Master 
                 Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.

                           WILL
                 Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.

                           SAM
                     (the effect is horrible)
                 "Parting is such sweet sorrow"

       HENSLOWE has been overhearing.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Another little problem.

                           WILL
                 What do we do now?

                           HENSLOWE
                 The show must  you know

                           WILL
                 Go on.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Juliet does not come on for twenty 
                 pages. It will be all right.

                           WILL
                 How will it?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I don't know. It's a mystery.

       And he makes his way towards the front of the house.

       EXT. STREET. DAY.

       A furious WESSEX is hurrying along the road to the 
       theatre.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

       VIOLA and the NURSE are arriving, and looking for a seat 
       in the gallery. BURBAGE and his MEN are standing at the 
       back, behind the people seated in the gallery. The first 
       scene of the play is continuing

                           ARMITAGE AS ABRAM
                 "Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"

                           JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON
                 "I do bite my thumb, sir."

       BURBAGE finds HENSLOWE plucking agitatedly at his sleeve.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Can we talk?

       They are standing behind the back row of the gallery 
       seats. The spectator in front of them is the NURSE. She 
       turns round and shushes HENSLOWE up.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                     (whispering to BURBAGE)
                 We have no Juliet!

                           BURBAGE
                     (forgetting to whisper)
                 No Juliet?!

                           VIOLA
                     (turning)
                 No Juliet?!

                           HENSLOWE
                 it will be all right, madam.

                           VIOLA
                 What happened to Sam?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Who are you?

                           VIOLA
                 Thomas Kent!

       Their whispers are causing black looks and hushing noises 
       from the neighbours. HENSLOWE pulls VIOLA from her seat, 
       luckily an aisle seat.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Do you know it?

                           VIOLA
                     (showing the manuscript)
                 Every word.

       HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other. CUT TO:

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           PHILIP AS LADY CAPULET
                 "Nurse, where is my daughter? Call her 
                 forth to me."

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Now by my maidenhead at twelve year 
                 old, I bade her come. What, lamb. What 
                 ladybird."

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS/STAGE. DAY.

       SAM who gathers himself, to make his entrance, quietly 
       and horribly practising "How now, who calls?"

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                     (on stage)
                 "God forbid. Where's this girl?

       The author and star, WILL SHAKESPEARE, has his back to 
       the stage, his hands over his ears. He is cowering in 
       dread anticipation.

                           RALPH AS NURSE (CONT'D)
                 "What, Juliet!"

       As SAM is about to enter HENSLOWE'S hand yanks him by the 
       collar, and VIOLA overtakes him and steps on stage. Enter 
       "JULIET." VIOLA is not wearing the been hidden from us by 
       her cloak.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "How now, who calls?"

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Your mother."

                 "Madam. I am here, what is your will?

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       There is a collective gasp. Nobody has ever seen a BOY 
       PLAYER like this.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

       WILL takes his hands from his ears, and turns round in 
       amazement at the sound of VIOLA'S voice.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

       WESSEX has just arrived in the auditorium and jumps as if 
       he has been shot. He seems about to intervene, but 
       looking around at the rapt faces he realises he cannot.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

       HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other.

                           BURBAGE
                 We will all be put in the clink.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (shrugs)
                 See you in jail.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       FENNYMAN, oblivious to the drama, is practising his lines 
       in a fever of nervousness.

                           FENNYMAN
                 "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's 
                 Law Is death to any he that utters 
                 them." Then him. Then me.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       Swordplay. An amazing performance that holds the audience 
       spellbound. "TYBALT" kills "MERCUTIO."

                           ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO
                     (to ROMEO)
                 "I am hurt.

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 Courage man. The hurt cannot be much.

                           ALLEYN A MERCUTIO
                 Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find 
                 me a grave man."

       A roll of thunder. Over the heads of the audience, far 
       above the thatched roof of the theatre, clouds are 
       gathering in the sky. On stage "MERCUTIO" is in 'ROMEO'S" 
       arms, but the tone of the playing is unlike anything we 
       have seen before: without bombast, intense and real. And 
       the audience is quiet and attentive.

                           ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO (CONT'D)
                 "--Why the devil came you between us? 
                 I was hurt under your arms."

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       In the semirural view towards the City of London, there 
       can be discerned a gaggle of approaching MEN and three is 
       something orderly about them. As they come closer, we see 
       that they are a company of PIKE MEN, marching toward the 
       theatre, led by the Master of the Revels, TILNEY. Thunder 
       rolls.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       Figures are running across the stage, in the panic that 
       follows "TYBALT" death.

                           ACTOR AS BENVOLIO
                 "Romeo, away, be gone! The citizens 
                 are up and Tybalt slain. Stand not 
                 amazed. The prince will doom thee 
                 death If thou art taken. Hence, be 
                 gone away!"

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "I am fortune's fool!"

                           ACTOR AS BENVOLIO
                 "Why dost thou stay!"

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       WILL has just 'killed' "TYBALT." He is still breathless 
       from fighting. he stands face to face with VIOLA.

                           WILL
                 I am fortune's fool.

       They stare at each other, transfixed.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 You are married?

       PAUSE. She cannot answer.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 If you be married, my gave is like to 
                 be my wedding bed. The implication of 
                 her silence fills the air. WILL does 
                 not move.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       We cannot tell whether this is the play or their life. 
       The audience, and the rest of the world, might as well 
       not exist. WILL turn from her and begins to descend from 
       the 'balcony.'

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "Art thou gone so?

       WILL stops.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET (CONT'D)
                 Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I must 
                 hear from thee every day in the hour, 
                 For in a minute there are many days. 
                 O, by this count I shall be much in 
                 years Ere I again behold my Romeo"

       WILL as "ROMEO" seems unable to speak. Then he says:

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Farewell"

       All other sounds drain away, and time seems to stop.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "O think'st thou we shall ever meet 
                 again? Methinks I see thee, now thou 
                 art so low, As one dead in the bottom 
                 of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails, 
                 or thou lookest pale."

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Trust me, love, in my eyes so do you. 
                 Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu. 
                 Adieu"

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       Now the FRIAR is giving "JULIET' his potion.

                           EDWARD AS FRIAR
                 "No warmth, no breath shall testify 
                 thou livest And in this borrow'd 
                 likeness of shrunk death Thou shall 
                 continue two and forty hours And then 
                 awake as from a pleasant sleep"

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       It's FENNYMAN'S moment. The "APOTHECARY" and "ROMEO."

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Come hither, man. I see that thou art 
                 poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let 
                 me have A dram of poison--"

                           FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY
                 "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's 
                 law is death to any he that utters 
                 them!"

       FENNYMAN has cut in several lines early, but his 
       conviction is astonishing.

                           FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY
                 "My poverty but not my will consents."

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "I pay thy poverty and not thy will."

       EXT. STREET. NEAR THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       TILNEY, on the march. His hand grips a copy of the 
       Curtain flyer.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       "JULIET" lies "dead." She lies on top of her tomb, "lying 
       in stage," her best dress, her hair done, her hands in 
       prayer at her breast, her eyes closed. "ROMEO" has found 
       her like this.

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your 
                 last embrace! and lips, Oh you The 
                 doors of breath, seal with a righteous 
                 kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing 
                 death! Come, bitter conduct; come, 
                 unsavory guide! Thou desparate pilot, 
                 now at once run on The dashing rocks 
                 thy seasick weary bark!"

       As WILL embraces her, VIOLA'S eyes flicker open (shielded 
       by WILL from the audience) and the lovers look at each 
       other for a moment as WILL and VIOLA rather than as 
       "ROMEO" and "JULIET." Their eyes are wet with tears.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       BURBAGE and ROSALINE are watching.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       KEMPE is watching.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       We see that in the audience are several of the WHORES we 
       recognise from the brothel. They are weeping openly.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       WILL is raising the fatal drug in a last toast.

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Here's to my love (he drinks) O true 
                 Apothecary."

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

       FENNYMAN, moved but proud in the wings.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (whispers to himself)
                 I was good. I was great.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss 
                 I die." (and he dies)

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       The NURSE is weeping too.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       "JULIET" wakes up with a start.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "Where is my lord?

       I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. 
       Where is my Romeo?"

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

                           NURSE
                     (involuntarily)
                 Dead!

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "What here? A cup clos'd in my true 
                 love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been 
                 his timeless end."

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       "JULIET" takes "ROMEO'S" dagger.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "O happy dagger

       This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die."

       She stabs herself and dies. The "inner curtain" closes 
       over the tomb.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       HIGH ANGLE on audience and stage. "THE PRINCE" played by 
       WABASH is having the last word.

                           THE PRINCE
                 "For never was a story of more woe 
                 Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

       The end. There is complete silence. The ACTORS are 
       worried. But then the audience goes mad with applause.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE INNER CURTAIN/STAGE. DAY.

       The inner curtain opens, but WILL and VIOLA, are in a 
       play of their ownembracing and kissing passionately, 
       making their own farewell. HENSLOWE is too stunned and 
       moved to react at first. Then he looks at the audience 
       and the penny drops. It's a hit.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

       The audience roars. WILL, VIOLA, and THE COMPANY come 
       forward to meet the applause. TILNEY and his MEN burst 
       in. TILNEY jumps up onto the stage, where the ADMIRAL'S 
       MEN are taking their bows. TILNEY'S "COPS" ring the 
       stage, facing inwards.

                           TILNEY
                     (shouts triumphantly)
                 I arrest you in the name of Queen 
                 Elizabeth!

       The AUDIENCE goes quiet. BURBAGE jumps out of the 
       audience onto the stage.

                           BURBAGE
                 Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

                           TILNEY
                 Everybody! The Admiral's Men, The 
                 Chamberlain's Men and everyone of you 
                 ne'er-do-wells who stands in contempt 
                 of the authority invested in me by her 
                 Majesty.

                           BURBAGE
                 Contempt? You closed the Rose--I have 
                 not opened it.

       TILNEY is at a loss but only for a moment.

                           TILNEY
                     (he points a "j'accuse" 
                      finger at VIOLA)
                 That woman is a woman!

       The entire audience and the actors, recoil and gasp. The 
       NURSE crosses herself.

                           ALLEYN
                 What?! A woman?! You mean that goat?!

       He points at VIOLA, brazening it out without much chance.

                           TILNEY
                 I'll see you all in the clink! In the 
                 same of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth

       And an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts 
       him.

                           VOICE
                 Mr. Tilney!

       It is QUEEN ELIZABETH herself, descending now, her hood 
       and cloak thrown back. She is an awesome sight. A shaft 
       of sunlight hits her.

                           QUEEN
                 Have a care with my name, you will 
                 wear it out.

       There is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and 
       actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN 
       ELIZABETH takes the limelight.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 The Queen of England does not attend 
                 exhibitions of public lewdness so 
                 something is out of joint. Come here, 
                 Master Kent. Let me look at you.

       VIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she 
       catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests 
       the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 Yes, the illusion is remarkable and 
                 your error, Mr. Tilney, easily 
                 forgiven, but I know something of a 
                 woman in a man's profession, yes, by 
                 God, I do know about that. That is 
                 enough from you, Maser Kent. If only 
                 Lord Wessex were here.

                           VOICE
                 He is, Ma'am.

       The voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a 
       figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look 
       inconspicuous.

                           WESSEX
                     (weakly)
                 Your Majesty

                           QUEEN
                 There was a wager, I rememberas to 
                 whether a play can show the very truth 
                 and nature of love. I think you lost 
                 it today.
                     (turning to WEBSTER)
                 You are an eager boy. Did you like the 
                 play?

                           WEBSTER
                 I liked it when she stabbed herself, 
                 your Majesty.

       The QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye.

                           QUEEN
                 Master Shakespeare. Next time to you 
                 come to Greenwich, Come as yourself 
                 and we will speak some more. WILL bows 
                 deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The 
                 waves part for her.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. MAIN ENTRANCE. DAY.

       The QUEEN is bowed out through the doors.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her 
       carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase 
       as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the 
       following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking 
       place, including some of the actors crowding to see her 
       off. WESSEX bows out of breath.

                           WESSEX
                 Your Majesty!

                           QUEEN
                 Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so 
                 soon?

                           WESSEX
                 Indeed I am a bride short. How is this 
                 to end?

       VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the 
       other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.

                           QUEEN
                 As stories must when love's 
                 denied--with tears and a journey. Those 
                 whom God has joined in marriage, not 
                 even I can put asunder.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                     (she turns to VIOLA)
                 Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost 
                 his wife in the play- house--go make 
                 your farewell and send her out. It's 
                 time to settle accounts.
                     (to WESSEX)
                 How much was the wager?

                           WESSEX
                 Fifty shillings.
                     (the QUEEN gives him a look)
                 Pounds.

                           QUEEN
                 Give it to Master Kent. He will see it 
                 rightfully home. WESSEX gives his 
                 purse to VIOLA.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                     (to VIOLA)
                 And tell Shakespeare something more 
                 cheerful next time for Twelfth Night.

       The QUEEN proceeds towards her carriage. There is an 
       enormous puddle between her and her carriage. The QUEEN 
       hesitates for a fraction and then marches through the 
       puddle as cloaks descend upon it.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 Too late, too late.

       She splashes her way into her carriage, which departs.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           WILL
                     (heartbroken, testing her 
                      name)
                 My Lady Wessex?

       VIOLA nods, heartbroken too. For a long moment they 
       cannot say anything to each other. The she holds up 
       Wessex's purse.

                           VIOLA
                 A hired player no longer. Fifty 
                 pounds, Will, for the poet of true 
                 love.

                           WILL
                 I am done with theatre. The playhouse 
                 is for dreamers. Look where the dream 
                 has brought us.

                           VIOLA
                 It was we ourselves did that. And for 
                 my life to come I would not have it 
                 otherwise.

                           WILL
                 I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.

                           VIOLA
                 If my hurt is to be that you will 
                 write no more, then I shall be the 
                 sorrier.

       WILL looks at her.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 The Queen commands a comedy, Will for 
                 Twelfth Night.

                           WILL
                     (harshly)
                 A comedy! What will my hero be but the 
                 saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick 
                 with love?

                           VIOLA
                 An excellent beginning
                     (a beat)
                 Let him bea duke. And your heroine?

                           WILL
                     (bitterly)
                 Sold in marriage and half way to 
                 America.

                           VIOLA
                     (adjusting)
                 At sea, then--a voyage to a new 
                 world?she lands upon a vast and empty 
                 shore. She is brought to the 
                 dukeOrsino.

                           WILL
                     (despite himself)
                 Orsinogood name

                           VIOLA
                 But fearful of her virtue, she comes 
                 to him dressed as a boy

                           WILL
                     (Catching it)
                 and thus unable to declare her love

       Pause. They look at each other. Suddenly the conversation 
       seems to be about them.

                           VIOLA
                 But all ends well.

                           WILL
                 How does it?

                           VIOLA
                 I don't know. It's a mystery

       WILL half smiles. Then he's serious. They look deeply at 
       each otherand rush into each other's arm.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 You will never age for me, nor fade, 
                 nor die.

                           VIOLA
                 Nor you for me.

                           WILL
                 Good bye, my love, a thousand times 
                 good bye.

                           VIOLA
                 Write me well.

       She kisses him with finality. Then turns and runs from 
       him. WILL watches as she goes.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       A blank page. A hand is writing: TWELFTH NIGHT. We see 
       WILL sitting at his table.

                           WILL (VO)
                 My story starts at seaa perilous 
                 voyage to an unknown landa shipwreck

       EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

       Two figures plunge into the water

                           WILL (VO)
                 the wild waters roar and heavethe 
                 brave vessel is dashed all to pieces, 
                 and all the helpless souls within her 
                 drowned

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       WILL at his table writing

                           WILL (VO)
                 all save one  a lady

       EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

       VIOLA in the water

                           WILL (VO)
                 whose soul is greater than the ocean  
                 and her spirit stronger than the sea's 
                 embrace  not for her watery end, but 
                 a new life beginning on a stranger 
                 shore

       EXT. BEACH. DAY.

       VIOLA is walking up a vast and empty beach .

                           WILL (VO CONTINUED)
                 It will be a love story  for she will 
                 be my heroine for all time

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       WILL looks up from the table.

                           WILL (VO CONTINUED)
                 and her name will be  Viola.

       He looks down at the paper, and writes: "Viola" Then: 
       "What country friends is this?"

       EXT. BEACH. DAY.

       DISSOLVE slowly to VIOLA, walking away up the beach 
       towards her brave new world.

                             THE END
SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
          
          A dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room.
          A slide projector dimly lights MR. FULLER, a crew-cutted
          Robert Stack type in a suit, as he addresses the group. The
          current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry
          figure - it could be any of about a billion people.
          
                              FULLER
                    ...So, let's keep a steely eye out
                    for this bastard. (THEN) Before we
                    dismiss, this is your monthly
                    reminder of why we're here.
          
          Fuller advances to a slide of the American flag. Close on
          one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties.
          He politely pays close attention to the presentation.
          
                              FULLER (CONT'D)
                    The American people want to travel.
                    (Slide: Family in front of a fake
                    dinosaur) They want to attend
                    baseball contests (Slide: Fat guys
                    spilling beers as they go for a
                    foul ball) and popular music
                    concerts. (Slide: John Tesh)
          
          Close on another face in the group. A doughy man with three-
          day scruff and a trendily long haircut. He looks bored,
          rolling his eyes at the speech.
          
                              FULLER (CONT'D)
                    They want to be happy. (Slide: People
                    line dancing) But, Security comes
                    first. (Slide: Army soldier with a
                    massive machine gun guards a play-
                    ground) Without security there can be
                    no happy. You are America's front
                    line in the global war on terror.
                    Let's hit the trenches and let's be
                    careful out there. (Slide: TSA logo)
          
          The lights come up and as the group files out we get a better
          look at their uniforms. The TSA agents move out into the...
          
          INT. AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY
          
          The agents take their places, manning the screening
          equipment. We push in on the bald man as he takes up his
          post next to the walk-through metal detector. This is KIRK
          KETTNER. He is not a looker. His uniform only serves to
          highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and
          demeanor are pleasant and kind.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          
          The scruffy agent is STAINER. He stands at the x-ray
          monitor. As the bags begin to move through, he does not pay
          any attention, rather he hands Kirk a flyer.
          
                                 STAINER
                    Kirk, bro.     Tonight?
          
          INSERT: The flyer reads, "Wheel in the Sky - a Tribute to
          Journey at Club Vertigo - Every Tuesday Night!" Stainer is
          pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo.
          
                              KIRK
                    I don't know, Stainer.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, you never come see us
                    anymore. It's been like four
                    months. Time to forget about
                    Marnie and get back on the whores.
          
          Stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable.
          Fuller shoots a stern look from his office.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's not that. It's my Grandma.
                    I'll probably be at the hospital
                    for the next few nights.
          
                               STAINER
                    Oh, shit. I spaced that.   How's
                    she doing?
          
                              KIRK
                    She's hanging in there but it
                    doesn't look good.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, I'm sorry. She's a great
                    lady. That sucks.
          
          A Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line. Mr.
          Fuller appears behind Kirk, taps his shoulder and subtly
          motions to the Arab. Kirk smiles at the potential terrorist.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey there, Habib.
          
                              HABIB

                                                                   3.

                    Yeah, sorry. I'll get you out of
                    here quick. You off to Boston again?

          Kirk opens Habib's bag.
          
                              HABIB (CONT'D)
                    Kirk, I know you're just doing your
                    job but, for Pete's sake, ya'll
                    know me.
          
                                 KIRK
                    I'm sorry.     It's just...
          
          Kirk gestures to his boss as he zips the bag back up.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Okay, Habib, you're all set buddy.
                    Have a good trip.
          
                              HABIB
                    Thanks Kirk. See you next time.
          
          Fuller again appears behind Kirk.
          
                              HABIB (CONT'D)
                        (to fuller - now in a
                         thick Arab accent)
                    Praise be to Allah.
          
                              FULLER
                    You think that's funny!? You wanna
                    sit in first class or you wanna sit
                    on my gloved and jellied finger!?
          
          EXT. AIRPORT CURB - DAY
          
          Follow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels
          click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind. Although
          we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see
          several men stare as she passes by on her way into...
          
          INT. AIRPORT TICKETING
          
          More stares from more men and even a few women as we follow
          the legs to the check-in line. The legs glide to the front
          and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent.
          
                                                                     4.
          
          
          
          From the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket
          agents. (One on each side of the legs.) One is black and one
          white; each are dealing with customers. They simultaneously
          notice our woman. They suspiciously eye one another and the
          race is on. Each agent begins typing furiously to expedite
          their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next.
          
          Angle on the WHITE AGENT as he waits on a yuppie couple.
          
                              WHITE AGENT
                        (RUSHED)
                    Okay, how many bags are you
                    checking? Any bags!?
          
                              YUPPIE MAN
                    Is this one too big to carry on?
          
                                WHITE AGENT
                    No.    Carry it on. Good call.
          
                              YUPPIE WOMAN
                    Grant, you don't want to lug that
                    thing all over the airport.
          
          The agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh. He looks to
          his right to check the progress of the BLACK AGENT, who is
          waiting on an old Asian woman.
          
                              BLACK AGENT
                        (RUSHED)
                    Did you pack your bags yourself?
          
          The Asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the
          question but she smiles and nods along.
          
                                ASIAN WOMAN
                    Yes.

                    Has anyone unknown to you asked you
                    to carry anything onto your flight?
          
          More smiles and blank nods.
          
                                ASIAN WOMAN
                    Yes.
          
                              BLACK AGENT
                    I think you mean NO.
          
                              WHITE AGENT
                    You can't do that!
          
                                                                     5.
          
          
          
                              BLACK AGENT
                    She doesn't know what the hell I'm
                    talking about!
          
                              YUPPIE MAN
                    Where exactly is gate F5?
          
                              WHITE AGENT
                    Just past F4. Have a day now
                    folks. Let's hustle it up.
          
                                 ASIAN WOMAN
                    Sank you!
          
                                 BLACK AGENT
                    No sweat.     Keep it moving.
          
          The Asian woman is not going anywhere. The black agent leans
          into her face and barks once like a dog. Her smile turns to
          fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie.
          
                                 BOTH AGENTS
                    Next!
          
          Reverse to show the woman they were competing for. She is a
          classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. Drop dead
          beautiful. She is startled by the sudden call from both men.
          She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the
          black agent. He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co-
          worker, who is being an overtly sore loser.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Hi, I'm booked on flight 94 to
                    Burbank. Molly McCall.
          
                              BLACK AGENT
                        (trying way too hard)
                    California. Fantastic. So do you
                    travel quite a bit?
          
          The white agent moves to loiter around the black agent's
          station, just to get a better look at MOLLY.
          
                              WHITE AGENT
                    Hey Derek. You got the     numbers on
                    the (making it up as he    goes) new,
                    um, procedures for the,    um, airport
                    thing... regarding the,    ah, planes?
                    (to Molly) Whassup?
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Kirk is at his post.
          
                                                                   6.
          
          
          
          Stainer works the next x-ray belt, where a young rocker type
          is running a guitar case through. Stainer stops the belt and
          moves it back to get a better look.
          
                              STAINER
                    Les Paul Classic re-issue?
          
                               ROCKER
                        (SMUG)
                    No, it's a sixty-five.   Mint.
          
                                STAINER
                    Fuck you.    No way.
          
          The rocker boy looks at his watch as Stainer rolls the case
          through and pops it open.
          
                              ROCKER
                    Dude, I'm late for my flight.
          
                              STAINER
                    Sorry, I have to search this case
                    for, you know, explosives and such.
                    This thing is sweet!
          
          Stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the
          bins and bags pile up before him.
          
          At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing
          through. Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but
          Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. No flirting
          or stammering - just friendly and relaxed.
          
                                KIRK
                    Morning.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, hello again.
          
                              KIRK
                    Second trip in two days?
          
          Molly is putting her laptop back in her bag.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Uggh. Yeah. It's just a short hop
                    to L.A. but they've got me going
                    back and forth three days in a row.
                    This client is killing me.
          
                              KIRK
                    Well hang in there kiddo and I
                    guess I'll see you tomorrow.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    It's a date.
          
          Molly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man
          except Kirk watches. Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk.
          
                              FULLER
                    Did'ja see that? Boy would I ever
                    like to...you know...put my penis
                    in her vagina. (wink)
          
          Back at Stainer's station. As he puts the guitar back in its
          case, he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine.
          Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes.
          
                              ROCKER
                    What the hell!?
          
          He grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, I am so sorry.
          
                              ROCKER
                    Sorry my ass! This thing is worth
                    more than you make in a year, you
                    clumsy motherfucker!
          
                              STAINER
                    Yeah, I bet it was but...
          
          Stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    "TSA is not responsible for items
                    lost or damaged in the security
                    screening process..."
          
          Stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand-
          written on the back. He reads them aloud.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    "...so fuck you."
          
          INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kirk enters to find his MOTHER, an attractive old woman,
          sitting with a short, plain woman about Kirk's age.
          
                               KIRK
                    Hey Mom.   Hey Marnie.
          
                                                                    8.
          
          
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    Oh, hi Sweetie.
          
          Across the room, Kirk's father is speaking to a man who looks
          a bit like Kirk. The man is telling a funny story that
          cracks up MR. KETTNER. The two pretend to box for a moment.
          
                              KIRK
                    Who's that guy Dad's with?
          
          MARNIE (the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Kirk, you've been really great about
                    your mom and I staying so close
                    since we broke up but I know how
                    much Grammy meant to you... Well, is
                    it okay with you that I'm here?
          
                               KIRK
                    Sure.   It's fine.   (it's not)
          
                              MARNIE
                    Okay, good. Then can I introduce
                    you to my new boyfriend?
          
          She leads Kirk over to the man who is speaking with his
          father. They are laughing again.
          
                              MARNIE (CONT'D)
                    Ron, this is Kirk.
          
                              RON
                    Uh, oh - the ex. Awkward! (Ron
                    and Mr. Kettner laugh) No! I'm
                    just jack-assin' with you, pirate.
                    Great to meet you. How you doing?
          
                              KIRK
                    I've been better.
          
                              RON
                    Right. Of course. I'm sorry about
                    your grandmother. It's just so...
                    Well, old people, you know, what
                    are you gonna do?
          
                               KIRK
                    Yeah.   Thanks.
          
          Kirk's brother ERIC and his fiance DEBBIE enter from the
          hall. They are both in their late thirties and good-looking
          for trailer trash. Debbie is about seven months pregnant.
          
                                                                   9.
          
          
          
                              ERIC
                    Little brother.   Grammy wants to
                    see you.
          
                               KIRK
                    Okay.   Well, I better get in there.
          
          Eric and Debbie walk with Kirk down the hall.
          
                              ERIC
                    Listen, I'm pretty sure she wants
                    to discuss the will. She won't
                    tell us dick, so we're kind of
                    hoping you can grease the wheels.
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, but you know Grammy didn't
                    have all that much. Once the
                    hospital and... and the ah...
          
                              ERIC
                    Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what
                    not...
          
                              KIRK
                    Well, it's not going to leave
                    enough to get worked up over.
          
                              DEBBIE
                    We've got a wedding to pay for,
                    Kirk and...
          
                              ERIC
                    Debbie, let me handle this. We've
                    got a wedding to pay for, numbnuts,
                    and you know Mom and Dad are going
                    to Branson next month. Now you
                    always been Grammy's favorite so
                    we're counting on you to get in
                    there and sort out what's what.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - GRAMMY'S ROOM
          
          In a dimly lit hospital room, a very old woman lies in a bed.
          She is hooked up to an I.V. and several monitors. Kirk comes
          in and forces a smile. Grammy's voice is weak and shaky.
          
                               GRAMMY
                    There you are Big Slick.   Did you
                    bring 'em?
          
                              KIRK
                    Grammy, you really shouldn't...
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
          
                              GRAMMY
                    Just hand 'em over. I'm on death's
                    door and you know it.
          
          Kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for Christ's sake. Filters?
          
          Grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag. Kirk tears
          up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life.
          
                              KIRK
                    I love you Grammy.
          
                              GRAMMY
                    Don't start that shit now. You're
                    looking at one lucky old broad who's
                    done a lot - skydiving, rollerderby,
                    colored fellas. I got no complaints.
                    So when the check comes I don't want
                    any blubbering or bullshit outta
                    you. Just enjoy your life like I
                    did mine and raise a glass to your
                    old Grammy once in a while.
          
          Kirk hugs her and he cries a bit.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    You know how much I love you Kirk.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Molly is coming through Kirk's lane again. Mr. Fuller steps
          in and stops her before she crosses through.
          
                              FULLER
                    Ma'am, could you please remove your
                    jacket and shoes?
          
                                MOLLY
                    Oh, sure.
          
          She does. Fuller is leering at her stellar body.   She's
          about to go through when he stops her again.
          
                              FULLER
                    Why don't we go ahead and strip off
                    that belt too while we're at it.
          
          Molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt.
          She starts to move through but again Fuller stops her with a
          raised palm. He then motions to her breasts and crotch.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          
          
                              FULLER (CONT'D)
                    Any piercings you'd like me to know
                    about?
          
                              KIRK
                    Why don't you just come on through,
                    ma'am, and we'll see if anything
                    sets off the machine.
          
          Molly steps through. The machine does not go off. She
          gathers her things and mouths a silent, "Thank You" to Kirk
          as she walks on. Fuller glares at Kirk but before he can say
          anything, RANDY, a young agent, calls out from the office.
          
                              RANDY
                    Kirk buddy! Phone call!
          
          Kirk walks over to take the call.
          
                              FULLER
                    You best hope the terrorists are
                    taking personal calls on the job
                    too, mister!
          
          Kirk takes the phone from Randy.
          
                              KIRK
                    This is Kirk Kettner.
          
          Kirk's expression tells us that some sad news is coming in.
          
          INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY
          
          Kirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee. He opens his
          wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger Grammy and an
          eight-year-old Kirk in a casino. Grammy is smoking a
          cigarette and dealing blackjack while Kirk sits at the table.
          
          Kirk tears up and puts his face in his hands.
          
          Molly is passing.   She sees Kirk and stops.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh Geeze. Please tell me I didn't
                    get you in trouble back there.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, no. It's not that.    I ah...I
                    lost somebody today.
          
          Molly sits down and puts her hand on his hand.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I
                    know... I lost my grandmother a
                    few months ago and I...
          
          Kirk tears up again and so does Molly.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Your grandmother too? And you were
                    close? Oh, you poor thing.
          
          Kirk tries to keep it together.   Molly looks at the photo.
          
                              KIRK
                    She used to be a blackjack dealer
                    at the Horseshoe. When I was
                    little, she taught me and my
                    friends how to play poker. Turned
                    us into a bunch of eight-year-old
                    degenerate gamblers.
          
          They share a sad laugh.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    So, your grandmother too, huh?
          
          Molly removes a small clear-plastic booklet of photos from
          her bag and shows a picture of her grandmother.
          
                              MOLLY
                    My Grammy Keenan was ninety four
                    but independent right to the end.
                    She was always trying to cook for
                    everyone. You couldn't stop her.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, God, I know. Grammy used to
                    change her own oil. Right up until
                    a few months ago. She was... Do
                    you change your own oil?
          
                              MOLLY
                        (LAUGHS)
                    No. I wouldn't know where to begin.
          
                              KIRK
                    I know, me neither. She could
                    barley walk and I'd come over and
                    find her lying under her Cadillac
                    all covered in grease.
          
          They share a laugh and Kirk is cheering up a bit.   An
          announcement comes over the PA.
          
                                                                   13.
          
          
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    ...final boarding call for United
                    flight 94 to Burbank...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, geeze, that's me. I'm so sorry.
          
                               KIRK
                    No, no.   Go catch your flight.
          
          Molly stands and offers her hand to Kirk.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    I'm Molly.

                    Kirk Kettner.
          
          Molly squeezes Kirk's hand, grabs her bags and trots off
          toward her gate. A businessman near Kirk's table reaches
          over and gives him a playful chuck on the shoulder.
          
                              BUSINESSMAN
                    Dead Grandma. (a nod and a cheek
                    click) Nice one.
          
          INT. AIRPORT GATE
          
          Molly arrives at the gate just in time to make her flight.
          
          INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP
          
          Kirk gathers his things and notices that Molly left her
          pictures on the table. He looks through them. In the last
          pouch are some business cards that read, "Molly McCall -
          Event Planner." Her cell number is on the card.
          
          INT. AIRPLANE 737
          
          Molly is sitting in a window seat. The flight is mostly
          empty. The two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a
          CREEPY BUSINESSMAN moves from the row behind her to the seat
          next to Molly. He casually smiles as though there is nothing
          odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat (and
          many full rows) are open. Molly looks at the vacant seats
          and then at him as if to say, "You've got to be kidding."
          
                              CREEPY BUSINESSMAN
                    How you doin'?
          
          Molly's phone rings and she fumbles to answer it.   A FEMALE
          PASSENGER sitting two rows back looks annoyed.
          
                                                                     14.

                    Hello?
          
                               KIRK
                    Oh, hi.   Molly McCall?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Who's calling please?
          
                              KIRK
                    It's Kirk... From the coffee shop.
                    You left your pictures with me. If
                    you tell me which gate you're at, I
                    can run them right down to you.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, no. I'm already on the plane
                    and we're pushing back right now.
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, well I'll leave them at the
                    lost and found and when you get...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh geeze, some of those are my only
                    prints. It would be such a huge
                    favor if you could hold on to them
                    for me. I'm coming back next week.
          
                                KIRK
                    Oh, sure.    But how will I...
          
          The female passenger hails the flight attendant.
          
                              FEMALE PASSENGER
                    She's talking on her phone.
          
          The creepy businessman gives the woman the finger and then
          looks to Molly for approval. He doesn't get it.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I have your number in my phone. As
                    soon as I get back I'll call you
                    and arrange to pick them up, okay?
                    Thank you so much, Kirk.
          
          Molly turns off her phone and holds it up for the flight
          attendant to see.
          
                               MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.   I'm really sorry.
          
                                                                     15.

                    You believe these pricks? So, what
                    do you do?

          INT. VERTIGO CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Kirk comes in and stops at the bar to order a beer. Two men
          are waving to him from a table near the stage. Kirk gets his
          bottle and snakes through the crowd toward his friends.
          
          On stage, Stainer (in his afro wig) plays guitar as his band
          finishes the last chorus of "Lovin', Touchin' Squeezin'."
          
                              STAINER
                    Thank you! We're going to take a
                    little breakski but we'll be back
                    in a few minutes to do Frontiers.
          
          The band turns to put down their instruments and the house
          music kicks in.
          
          Kirk arrives where his friends are standing at a high bar
          table. DEVON looks like Howdy Doody at 33. JACK is good-
          looking and dressed semi-hipster. Devon gives Kirk a hug.
          
                                DEVON
                    Hey Kirk.    How you been holdin' up?
          
                              KIRK
                    It's been a rough week but, you
                    know, all of the services and
                    family stuff keep you pretty
                    busy... I really miss her, though.
          
          Jack hugs Kirk as well.
          
                              JACK
                    She sounded like a hell of a lady.
          
                              STAINER (O.S.)
                    Oh, fuck yeah! Kirk's Grandma was
                    the shit.
          
          Stainer arrives, hugs Kirk and gives him a kiss on the head.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    She's with God now, buddy - and you
                    just know she's bustin' his balls.
          
          Kirk laughs and Stainer raises his glass.
          
                                                                      16.

                    To Stella!
          
          The guys all raise their glasses and take a drink.     This is
          just what Grammy wanted and it's cheering Kirk up.
          
          Kirk's cell phone rings.      He has to talk loud over the music.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hello?... Oh, Hi. I'm sorry I can
                    barely hear you. I'm at a club
                    and.... Club Vertigo? Oh, yeah -
                    it's right down the street from
                    there... Okay, sounds good.
          
          Kirk hangs up.
          
                              JACK
                    What was that all about?
          
                              KIRK
                    Nothing, just a passenger. She
                    accidentally left something with
                    me. She's going to stop in and
                    pick it up I guess.
          
                              DEVON
                    She's coming here?      She a cute gal?
          
                                 KIRK
                    Very.
          
                              STAINER
                    Well alright dude! That's a leave-
                    behind. She digs you!
          
                              KIRK
                    No she doesn't.      Trust me.
          
                              STAINER
                    She does a leave behind and then
                    just happens to be in the
                    neighborhood? She practically has
                    her hands in your pants.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, seriously - it's nothing.      She's
                    way out of my league.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, you said Marnie was out of
                    your league and let's face it,
                    Marnie's kinda nasty.
          
                                                                     17.
          
          
          
          Marnie is standing behind Stainer.     He doesn't miss a beat.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    ...Marnie...don't you think Marnie
                    Tomkins is kind of nasty?
          
                              MARNIE
                    I don't know who that is.
          
                              STAINER
                    Oh, you don't know Marnie Tomkins?
                    She's just this girl. I thought you
                    knew her. Anyway, she's pretty nasty
                    looking... but you're looking good.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Kirk, I'm sorry about Grammy.
          
          The guys slink away to give Kirk and Marnie some privacy.
          
                              MARNIE (CONT'D)
                    I realize she was never that crazy
                    about me but I know how much you
                    loved her and I hope you're okay.
          
                               KIRK
                    Thanks.   Thanks, I'll be alright.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Listen, are you going to Branson
                    with your folks next month?
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   It's not really my thing.
          
                              MARNIE
                    What's wrong with Branson?     You too
                    good for Branson now?
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   Branson's...awesome.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Well, your mom invited Ron and I
                    along. We'd love to go but not if
                    it's going to be weird for you.
          
          Kirk considers this.   It will be weird.
          
                              MARNIE (CONT'D)
                    ...I mean the tickets are non-
                    refundable but it's up to you.
          
                                                                  18.
          
          
          
          Stainer overhears this and groans out loud.
          
                              KIRK
                    No. You should go. I'm sure
                    you'll have a great time. Totally.
          
          Marnie hugs Kirk.   This makes him uncomfortable.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Kirk, I'm sorry about what happened
                    with us. You're going to make
                    someone very happy someday, but you
                    have to get over me first, okay?
                    Is it a deal?
          
          Marnie hugs him again and then departs.
          
                              STAINER
                    She's going to Branson with your
                    fucking parents? And bringing her
                    new fucking boyfriend!?
          
                             KIRK
                    Yeah. He seems like a good guy,
                    though.  He's an entrepreneur.
          
          Across the room they see Marnie return to Ron with a hug.
          
                              JACK
                    Entrepreneur? Kirk, I know that
                    guy. He owns a Pizza Hut.
          
                               KIRK
                    So?   That's a business.
          
                              STAINER
                    It's not even a real Pizza Hut.
                    It's one of those strip-mall take-
                    out ones. They don't even have
                    chicken wings. The guy's a fuckin'
                    douche bag.
          
                              KIRK
                    He's got more going on than I do.
                    That's all I'm saying.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, you can do a hell of a lot
                    better than her.
          
                              DEVON
                    One door closes, another door opens.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    Fuck you Devon, that doesn't even
                    make any sense. But take this
                    broad that's coming here tonight -
                    I got a feeling about her. You're
                    gonna get on that.
          
                              JACK
                    Absolutely. Visualize it.
          
                              KIRK
                    I appreciate what you guys are
                    trying to do but, I'm telling you,
                    I have zero chance with this one
                    and I'm completely okay with that.
          
                              DEVON
                    That's defeatist thinking.
          
                              KIRK
                    No it isn't. It's just like saying
                    I'll never go to the moon and I'm
                    okay with that too.
          
                              STAINER
                    You're saying you don't want to go
                    to the moon? That's bullshit.
          
                              KIRK
                    No. I'm saying that I never will
                    go to the moon but I'm not going to
                    get down about it because, you know
                    - I never expected to.
          
                              STAINER
                    You don't know. Technology and
                    shit. You might go to the moon.
          
          Kirk waves to someone at the door.   The guys look up.
          
          The guys' POV: Molly is stepping toward them - dressed in a
          beautiful gown. They laugh the way you might laugh at a
          particularly brutal football tackle.
          
                              DEVON
                    Holy Frijole.
          
                               JACK
                    Oh shit.   Yeah, you're right.
          
                              STAINER
                    Sorry, bro. You'll go to the moon
                    before you'll hit that. No chance.
          
                                                                     20.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    I told you.
          
          Molly arrives at their table.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    Hey!     There you are!
          
          Molly hugs Kirk.    From across the bar, Marnie takes notice.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Here I am.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I'm sorry I'm so overdressed. I
                    just came from a work thing. Are
                    you doing okay with...everything?
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, you know... Hey, these are my
                    best friends - Jack, Devon and
                    Stainer.
          
          The guys' I.Q.s drop like stones as they shake her hand.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    Stainer?
          
                              STAINER
                    Yeah, just a nickname.    Doesn't
                    really mean nothin'.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh. Here's your pictures - all
                    safe and sound.
          
          Kirk hands Molly the pictures.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Thank you so much for taking care of
                    them for me! I need to get some
                    copies made. If I lost these...uugh.
          
                              KIRK
                    No trouble at all.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Hey, have you eaten yet?
          
                                 KIRK
                    Um...
          
                                                                    21.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    I was going to go grab a bite. Let
                    me buy you dinner to pay you back.
          
                              KIRK
                    You don't have to pay me back.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I know. I want to. Come on! The
                    place across the street has the
                    best greasy burgers in town.
          
                              KIRK
                    A burger does sound good. (then to
                    the guys) I'm going to just ah...
          
          Molly waves goodbye and heads for the door. Kirk starts to
          follow but Stainer pulls him back for a quick huddle.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude. It's cool that she's buying
                    you dinner but do not get your
                    hopes up about this one.
          
                              KIRK
                    Don't worry. Believe me, I know.
          
          Kirk catches up with Molly.   Marnie watches them exit.
          
          A big guy has overheard this and leans over to Stainer.
          
                              BIG GUY
                    Good advice there friend. Your boy
                    ain't got a prayer with that chick.
          
                              STAINER
                    You talking shit about my buddy!?
                    'Cause I'm giving out free fuckin'
                    ambulance rides!
          
          Big Guy assesses the crazy on Stainer's face and stands down.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, I didn't think so!
          
          INT. BURGER JOINT - NIGHT
          
          Kirk and Molly sit across from one another in a booth.    The
          WAITER arrives.
          
                              WAITER
                    Start you off with something to
                    drink ma'am?
          
                                                                 22.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    I'll have a Bass.
          
                              WAITER
                    And for your... brother?
          
                                 KIRK
                    What?     Oh, I'm not her brother.
          
                              WAITER
                    Oh, I'm sorry. I just figured...

                    You know what, a Bass sounds good.
                    Make that two.
          
                                WAITER
                    Great.    Sorry.
          
          The waiter exits.
          
                              KIRK
                    So... You know what I do, what
                    about you? Your card said event
                    planner. How'd you get into that?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Well, it wasn't the original plan.
                    I went to law school. Ended up at
                    a big firm but I hated it. Then,
                    they asked me to plan the Christmas
                    party. It was a big hit and a few
                    months later I was done with law.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Wow.
          
                                MOLLY
                    I know.    Pernicious career move,
                    right?
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, I don't know what that word
                    means. What was it?
          
          Close on Molly's smile. She finds Kirk's unabashed admission
          very refreshing and endearing.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    I'm sorry.     Like, destructive or...
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, okay. No, I don't think that's
                    so perni...gious?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Pernicious.
          
                              KIRK
                    Good - new word. No, not pernicious
                    at all. Not if you enjoy the work.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I really do. We do a lot of
                    charity events and I get to work
                    with some of the most amazing human
                    beings on some really fun projects.
                    Next month I'm doing a cancer
                    benefit with Billy Joel.
          
                               KIRK
                    Wow.   I love Billy Joel.
          
                              MOLLY
                    The only downside is I have to do a
                    lot of public speaking and I've
                    always struggled with stage fright.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh man - That's my number one fear.
                    I'm terrified of getting up in
                    front of people. I'd rather get a
                    Kentucky root canal.
          
          Molly laughs. An older GOOD-LOOKING MAN steps up to the
          table and stands facing her with his back to Kirk.
          
                              GOOD-LOOKING MAN
                    Excuse me, I was just sitting over
                    at the bar and I was wondering; has
                    anyone told you today that you are
                    absolutely stunning?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Are you seriously hitting on me
                    right in front of my boyfriend?
          
          He turns to Kirk and both men start to laugh.
          
                              GOOD-LOOKING MAN
                    This is your boyfriend?
          
                                                                   24.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                     Oh, yeah right! (Catches Molly's
                     unspoken instructions.) But, yeah.
                     I'm her boyfriend, I guess, so...
          
                                GOOD-LOOKING MAN
                     Really?   Wow. Well... sorry.
          
                               KIRK
                     Honest mistake.
          
          The man gives Kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar.
          
                               MOLLY
                     Did you get a load of that hair-
                     piece? What is it with men? I
                     mean, look at you. You're bald and
                     you're fine with it. A little
                     dignity is all I'm saying. The
                     toupees and plugs and the teen-
                     dream sports cars... Oh geeze, I'm
                     sorry. Do you drive a sports car?
          
                               KIRK
                     I drive a 94 Taurus. It's got
                     AM/FM but I wouldn't call it a
                     sports car per se.
          
          Molly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets
          of conversation as they eat, chat and laugh.
          
                               KIRK (CONT'D)
                     So here's this little old lady
                     trying to go through security with
                     six pounds of weed in her girdle!
          
          Cut.   The food is being served.
          
                               MOLLY
                     Oh, my God! I love that book!
          
          Cut.   The waitress is picking up the empty plates.
          
                               KIRK
                     So, a duck walks into a bar...
          
          Cut.   Molly is laughing while she's paying the bill.
          
                               MOLLY
                     Well, I've got an early morning. I
                     should go. Thanks for coming
                     along. This was really fun. And
                     thanks again for helping me out.
          
                                                                        25.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    No, thank you for dinner. I feel
                    bad that you won't let me...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, stop it. Listen, I handle some
                    of the charity events for the
                    Coyotes and I've got some tickets
                    for the hockey game tomorrow night.
                    You interested?
          
          Kirk is a bit taken aback and confused.     Is she actually
          asking him out on a real date?
          
                              KIRK
                        (NERVOUSLY)
                    Um, sure. Yeah, great. I mean,
                    I'm free tomorrow night.
          
          She digs two tickets out of her purse and hands them over.
          
                             MOLLY
                    Perfect. I hate to see them go to
                    waste. There's two so maybe bring
                    Stainer?
          
          Kirk's expression is as much relief as disappointment.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Oh, right.     Thanks!   Thank you.
          
          EXT. HOCKEY ARENA - NIGHT
          
          Kirk and Stainer are on their way through security. A huge
          security guard runs a metal-detector wand over Stainer.
          
                              STAINER
                    Whatcha runnin' there a PX-235?
          
                              GUARD
                    I don't know sir.
          
                              STAINER
                    The two hundred series are dog
                    shit. You couldn't find a bazooka
                    with that thing. You should look
                    into the new eight fifties.
          
                              GUARD
                    Can you keep it moving sir?
          
                                                                  26.

          Kirk and Stainer arrive at the third row to find two open
          seats right next to the penalty box. To Kirk's surprise, in
          the next seat - Molly! Kirk elbows Stainer.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey, it's Molly.       She's here.
          
                                 STAINER
                           (PERPLEXED)
                    Huh.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Hey guys! You made it! Hooray!
                    Thanks for coming.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Oh, yeah.     Wouldn't miss it.
          
                              STAINER
                    Thanks for the sweet seats!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Guys, this is my best friend in the
                    whole world, Patty. This is Kirk
                    and, um, Stainer, right?
          
          Patty is over 200 pounds with a pretty face and an edge that
          comes from a lifetime of taking crap from morons.
          
                                 PATTY
                    Hey boys.     Nice to meet you.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Patty's my assistant and my go-to
                    gal. Whatever you need, she can
                    make it happen on a moments notice.
          
                              PATTY
                    You need a cock-shaped cake with a
                    cotton-candy bush delivered by four
                    o'clock? I'm your connection.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, and she likes to shock people
                    so don't let her freak you out.
          
                              KIRK
                    How 'bout that. So, we're going to
                    grab some beers. Can we bring you
                    ladies anything? Beer? Nachos?
                    Patty, cotton candy?
          
                                                                 27.

          Stainer and Kirk stand in the beer line.
          
                              STAINER
                    That's it. She's setting you up
                    with the fat chick.
          
                              KIRK
                    Ooohhh! Okay! Okay! That makes
                    sense, right!? When Molly was here
                    I was like, "what!?" But, okay!
                    Well, Patty seems cool. She's funny.
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, yeah, she has to be.
          
                              KIRK
                    What does that mean?
          
                              STAINER
                    Nothing. The fat chick seems
                    great. You never know, bro, that
                    fat chick could wind up being the
                    love of your life.
          
          Kirk returns a look of annoyance.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Patty, I'm saying. Patty could be
                    the love of your life.
          
          INT. HOCKEY ARENA
          
          The game has started. Kirk, Stainer, Molly and Patty are
          cheering. The puck smacks the glass before them and another
          player skates up for it. As he mucks it from the edge, he
          looks up and sees Molly. He's distracted just long enough to
          get brutally checked face first into the glass. A penalty is
          called on the player who hit him. That player skates into
          the penalty box near Molly. The name on his jersey reads,
          "REESE." He speaks with a thick Canadian accent.
          
                                 REESE
                    Hey Molly!     Yer lookin' good, eh!
          
                              MOLLY
                    That was a bogus call, Bobby.    Your
                    skates barely left the ice.
          
                               REESE
                    I know.   What's that aboot, eh?
          
                                                                  28.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                        (nervously to Reese)
                    Yeah, that ref is like a total
                    blindo, man.
          
                                 STAINER
                    Blindo?
          
                              PATTY
                    Kirk, Molly's sister is blind.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
          
                              MOLLY
                        (not offended)
                    Oh, I know. It's fine.
          
          INT. BROADCAST BOOTH
          
          The radio announcers are calling the game.
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Forty Five seconds left on the
                    Power Play and the Sharks are
                    knocking at the door.
          
          INT. HOCKEY ARENA
          
                              REESE
                    So, after the game, you wanna party?
          
                              MOLLY
                    You know my policy on players,
                    Bobby. And you might have noticed
                    we've already got dates.
          
          The penalty ends and the ref opens the box but Reese is not
          paying attention.
          
                              REESE
                    Come on, Molly. Just give me a
                    chance, eh.   I'm a great guy - ask
                    any of these assholes.
          
          The crowd is booing Reese.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Reese, you'd better...
          
                              REESE
                    You can't seriously be blowing me
                    off for these two hosers.
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    Hey! Fuck you Reese!    You suck
                    this year anyway!
          
          Reese raises his squirt bottle over the glass and squirts
          Stainer.
          
                                STAINER (CONT'D)
                    You dick!
          
          Stainer is immediately on his feet, climbing the glass and
          trying to pummel the huge player. Security is on him in a
          flash and dragging him, kicking & swearing, out of the arena.
          
          Reese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late.
          The Sharks score and the crowd revolts. A red-haired redneck
          woman, sitting two rows back, calls out to Molly and company.
          
                              RED-HAIRED WOMAN
                    You idiots just cost us a goal!    I
                    hope you're happy!
          
                              PATTY
                    You'd better check that tone, Reba!
                    You do NOT want me comin' up there!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Patty! Stop it! I'll go see what
                    I can do about Stainer.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, this is my fault, I'll take
                    care of it.
          
                              MOLLY
                    No, it's okay. I know the head of
                    security. I'll be right back.
          
          Molly exits and Patty sits back down next to Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    God, I'm really embarrassed.
          
                              PATTY
                    That's okay, if Reese did that to
                    me I'd have gone over the glass
                    too. But I would have landed a few
                    before they got me. Reese has been
                    all over Molly ever since she
                    dumped her boyfriend. I tell you,
                    that girl has nothing but trouble
                    when it comes to men.
          
                                                   30.
          
          
          
                    KIRK
          What? How is that even possible?
          She's so...
          
                    PATTY
          Tell me about it. I'm no lezbo but
          sometimes she makes me want to
          strap on - if know what I'm saying.
          
                     KIRK
          Yeah.   I think I do.
          
                    PATTY
          It's a curse, looking like that.
          Who has the balls to hit on her?
          Just the most arrogant A-holes like
          Reese out there.
          
                    KIRK
          Yeah, I suppose.
          
                    PATTY
          Listen, Molly brought me along
          tonight because, you know, she
          thought I might be 'interested.'
          
                     KIRK
          Oh.   Oh yeah?
          
                    PATTY
          But, just for honesty's sake, I'm
          not interested. No offense.
          
                    KIRK
          No! Hey! None taken. I don't
          blame you. I know I'm no Brad
          Pitt. That's cool.
          
                    PATTY
          What? You? No, I'm talking about
          your pal, Stainer. I know he's your
          friend but he seems like kind of a
          dumbshit. (THEN) Wait. Why would
          you think I was talking about you?
          
                       KIRK
          I'm sorry.     I didn't mean to assume
          anything.
          
                    PATTY
          Oh my God. You don't have a clue
          do you? Molly's really into you.
          
                                                                   31.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, yeah right!
          
          Kirk laughs hard until he realizes that Patty isn't laughing.
          Patty's nod says, "I'm serious."
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    But... why would...
          
                              PATTY
                    A knockout like Molly be interested
                    in a spud like you?
          
                              KIRK
                    Well, yeah.
          
                              PATTY
                    Got me. Again, no offense. But
                    listen, Kirk, your dream girl just
                    showed up. Try not to blow it.
          
          Close on Kirk's terrified expression.   The SOUND of a bowling
          ball demolishing ten pins...
          
          INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
          
          The place is crowded and classic rock is cranking. It's an
          old alley with overhead-projection score sheets. Kirk,
          Stainer and Devon sit and talk while Jack throws a strike.
          
                              DEVON
                    Atta boy Jackers!
          
                              STAINER
                    It doesn't add up, Kirk. If
                    Molly's so into you, why bring her
                    friend and give you two tickets?
          
                              KIRK
                    She was hoping to set Patty up with
                    you.
          
                                 STAINER
                    Oh, great.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's okay, she wasn't interested.
          
                              STAINER
                    So you're saying the hottest babe
                    in the world wants you and the fat
                    chick isn't into me. Will you
                    listen to yourself? Fuck you.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  32.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    What did Molly have to say about
                    all this?
          
                              KIRK
                    I don't know, Stainer, somebody got
                    thrown out of the game and I had to
                    drive him home, remember?
          
                              DEVON
                    Pretty impressive catch, Kirky.
          
                              STAINER
                    There's no way. Don't get him all
                    worked up. Her friend was fuckin'
                    with him. Molly said herself that
                    Patty loves to mess with people.
          
                              DEVON
                    Kirk, you deserve a gal like her.
                    And Stainer, why don't you try to
                    be a little more supportive.
          
                              STAINER
                    Why don't you try a little shut the
                    fuck up, Devon. This week, we're
                    not taking dating tips from the guy
                    who met his wife in eighth grade.
          
                              JACK
                    Are we still bowling?
          
          Stainer picks up a crappy, beat up ball from the ball return.
          
                              STAINER
                    All I'm saying is - she's just too
                    hot. No judgement on Kirky, the
                    guy's just outgunned here.
          
                              KIRK
                    I can't argue with him.
          
          Stainer goes to the line. The BOWLER (a pro-type with a
          custom ball and glove) on the next lane is already standing
          about to roll. Stainer starts to step up.
          
                              BOWLER
                    Yo, house ball! I was up first.
          
                              STAINER
                    Oh for fucks... What is it with you
                    people?
          
                              BOWLER
                    Just wait your turn.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    All this noise and bullshit in this
                    place and I'm such a distraction
                    over here in your god damned
                    peripheral vision!?
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay Stains, take it easy.
          
          The bowler stands glaring back.
          
                               STAINER
                    Well!?   Fuckin' roll then!
          
          The bowler takes another minute to set. Stainer lets out a
          long sigh. The bowler steps to the line and Stainer rushes
          into his own delivery. Both men throw gutters. The bowler
          comes at Stainer but their friends separate them.
          
                              BOWLER
                    You're lucky motherfucker!
          
                                STAINER
                    Oh yeah!?    Bring it, Brunswick!
          
                                DEVON
                    Stainer!    Cool your jets, buster.
          
          The bowler's friends drag him away. Stainer takes a deep
          breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode.
          
                              STAINER
                    Okay. Anyway... I love Kirky but
                    let's face it, the guy's a three.
          
                              DEVON
                    Stainer, that's just dirty pool.
                    He's at least a four.
          
                              STAINER
                    You're outta your fuckin' mind -
                    four! You go ahead and pump
                    rainbows up his ass. I'm just
                    being honest.
          
          Stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the
          glass. It projects onto the overhead scoreboard.
          
                              KIRK
                    I can live with three.
          
                                                             34.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    He's a nice guy and he's funny.
                    Those are a half a point each.
          
          Stainer continues the equation on the projector.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    But he drives a shit box so we
                    gotta deduct a point for that.
          
                              DEVON
                    Kirk said she likes his Taurus.
          
                              STAINER
                    That's so fucked, I won't even
                    dignify it with a response. So
                    we're back to three. Meanwhile,
                    this Molly is a hard ten.
          
                              DEVON
                    A hard ten?
          
                               STAINER
                    Generally, if a broad is that hot
                    you can deduct a few points for dumb
                    or shallow but she went to law
                    school and her sister's blind.
                    That's a hard ten, friends, and that
                    is rare. A seven point disparity -
                    that's a chasm. The most you can
                    jump is two points. I can't even
                    get a ten.
          
                              JACK
                    Oh, not even you, huh?
          
                              STAINER
                    I'm a five, okay?
          
                                JACK
                    Bullshit.    Then what am I?
          
                              STAINER
                    You're a seven and a half.
          
                              JACK
                    Fine, you're a five then.
          
                              STAINER
                    Okay, so I get a two point bump for
                    being in a band. That puts me at
                    seven. On a good day, most I can
                    bag is a niner.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    What about your shitty car?
          
                              STAINER
                    Artist exemption. I'm expected to
                    have a shitty car.
          
                              JACK
                    Is there an artist exemption for
                    being a jag-off?
          
                              STAINER
                    Fuckin' A there is.
          
                              KIRK
                    Stainer's right. Patty was
                    probably just messing around. It's
                    not a big deal. Let's just bowl.
          
                              DEVON
                    What about Rick Ocasek?   Billy
                    Joel, Donald Trump...
          
                              STAINER
                    Yeah, dumbass. Those are the wild-
                    cards. Money and fame.
          
                              JACK
                    So, if he were a millionaire?
          
                              STAINER
                    A mil ain't what it once was,
                    Jackie. Devon's practically a
                    millionaire for Christ sake. A mil
                    might get you an eight but to bring
                    down a ten now days - two million
                    minimum.
          
          Stainer finishes the equation by writing, "Kirk = Fucked."
          Kirk's phone rings. He checks the ID and his eyes go wide.
          
                              KIRK
                        (into the phone)
                    Hey, Molly... Um, yeah, sure...
                    No, that sounds good. Yeah, I know
                    where that is. Um, okay, yeah...
                    see you then.
          
          Kirk hangs up and gapes at his friends, who wait in suspense.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Holy crap. (dazed pause) She just
                    asked me out for tomorrow night!
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
          
          Kirk exchanges fives, fists, tips and hugs with Devon and
          Jack. Stainer shakes his head, still not buying it.
          
          INT. BOWLING ALLEY MEN'S ROOM
          
          Kirk runs into the otherwise empty restroom. He stares into
          the mirror and his smile fades into panic. He splashes water
          on his face. He reaches for a paper towel but the dispenser
          is empty.
          
                              KIRK
                        (to himself)
                    It's okay. Get it together. Guys
                    do this all the time. You can do
                    this. You can make it happen.
          
                              RANDOM MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        (from inside a stall)
                    You better not be jerking off in
                    the sink, man!
          
          EXT. AIRPORT PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Kirk's Taurus pulls into a space. He climbs out and slams
          the door. As it closes, he reaches but too late. He looks
          through the window. The keys are hanging in the ignition.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS
          
          WILLY, the Russian driver, is chipper and bubbly as he sings
          along with "I'm Like a Bird" on the radio. Kirk is knocked
          around by Willy's crazy driving. In the mirror, Willy
          notices Kirk's dazed expression.
          
                              WILLY
                        (thick accent)
                    Kirk! You look like someone made a
                    second number in your breakfast
                    cereal. You are doing okay, yes?
          
                              KIRK
                    You know what Willy. I honestly
                    don't know how I'm doing.
          
                              WILLY
                    He does not know!
          
                              KIRK
                    I should be doing awesome but I
                    don't know. Know what I mean?
          
                              WILLY
                    Nope!
          
                                                                     37.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    How are you?
          
                              WILLY
                    Perfect! Willy is having another
                    kick ass of a day.
          
          Willy takes a hard left and some suitcases fall on Kirk.
          
          INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT - DAY
          
          Kirk is picking up a coffee. As he walks on, he takes a sip.
          The lid comes off and hot coffee spills on his shirt.
          
                              STAINER (O.S.)
                    Way to go, Big Slick.
          
          Stainer is now next to Kirk, who glares back at him as they
          walk across the food court.
          
          A short, plain girl behind the Orange Julius counter gives
          them an apprehensive wave.
          
                                STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Oh, shit.    Let's go this way.
          
          Stainer returns an uncomfortable smile but then redirects
          their path away from her. Kirk waves.
          
                              KIRK
                    Who's that?
          
                              STAINER
                    Nobody. Just some chick I boned
                    once when I was drunk. You look
                    like shit, bro.
          
                              KIRK
                    Thanks. I had trouble sleeping
                    last night. This Molly thing... I
                    don't want to want this, you know?
                    It just seems too good to be true.
                    I just don't get it.
          
                              STAINER
                    I know what you mean.   There has to
                    be some explanation.
          
                              KIRK
                    I can't think of one.   Not one that
                    makes any sense.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, let's spitball it a little.
                    You've got dick for money so she's
                    no gold digger. Oohh! Did you
                    ever see Double Indemnity?
          
                              KIRK
                    Please don't say she wants me to
                    kill someone.
          
                              STAINER
                    Okay, then... maybe she's on a
                    scavenger hunt. You know, like
                    find a wagon wheel, a wiffle ball
                    bat and a fat, bald TSA agent -
                    that kind of thing.
          
          Kirk is no longer responding.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Oh, shit, dude. Al Qaeda. Think
                    about it. You're a TSA agent,
                    she's a terrorist...
          
          Kirk walks away.
          
          EXT. OLD STRIP MALL - DAY
          
          Kirk, still in his TSA uniform, walks past a large laundromat
          to a small storefront next door. The chipped and faded
          lettering on the glass reads, "Maury Hammerstein, Attorney At
          Law - Aggressive, Dynamic Representation Since 1942!" As
          Kirk reaches for the door, he notices a small hand-written
          sign, "I don't make change!" He goes inside.
          
          INT. LAW OFFICE
          
          Wood paneling, buzzing fluorescent lights and furniture the
          Salvation Army would sell only as firewood.
          
          Eric and Debbie sit with Kirk's parents. There are two
          elderly women and another middle aged man in the room as
          well. Maury, who's about a hundred years old - cute and
          meek, fusses with an ancient VCR while smoking a cigarette.
          
          Kirk sits down next to Eric. Kirk notices a free bank
          calender on Maury's desk - dated 1991.
          
                              ERIC
                    It's about time, numbnuts.
          
                              KIRK
                    I came right from work.
          
                                                                   39.
          
          
          
                              MR. KETTNER
                    Okay Maury - we're all here.
          
                              MAURY
                    Oh! You bet! You betcha! Okay,
                    hi there Kirk. Firstly, let me
                    just say how awful sorry I am.
                    Stella was one heck of a gal and a
                    real dish. Anyhow, let me just...
          
          Maury gets the VCR going.   "Wheel of Fortune" comes up on the
          screen.
          
                              MAURY (CONT'D)
                    Oh mercy. I didn't tape over her
                    with The Wheel did I?
          
          The picture goes to snow and then stutters into a shot of
          Grammy sitting in her kitchen. She has just clicked the
          video camera on with a remote control.
          
                                MAURY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, good.    There she is.
          
                              GRAMMY
                    Testing. One, two, three, four.
                    Oh, this God damned thing!
          
          She gets up and fusses with the camera.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Jap piece of shit! Is it on!?
          
          Cutaway to Kirk tearing up.   Grammy sits back down.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, my name is Stella Edith Dakin
                    and if you're watching this, I'm
                    dead as a doorknob and I ain't
                    spent all my money yet. I got shit
                    to do today so I'm going to get
                    right to it. This is my last will
                    and testament and if you miss
                    anything the old Jew's got the
                    paperwork. Okay, here's the
                    deal...
          
          Everyone besides Kirk leans in, excited to hear what they
          might get. A phone rings. Maury looks around but the
          ringing is coming from the TV. Grammy answers the phone.

                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Hello? I'm kind of busy right now
                    Eric... Oh, for God's sake, boy!
                    How can you be sure it's even
                    yours? It could be practically
                    anybody's!... No, I'm not paying
                    for that!... Well, then I guess
                    you're going to be a daddy.
                    Congratulations, now I gotta go!
          
          She hangs up, puts on her glasses and lights up a smoke.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Anyway! I love all of you, despite
                    some of the shit you pulled, but I
                    spent my life a gambler and I always
                    put my money on the best bet. The
                    odds of any of you fish doing
                    anything worthwhile with my stack
                    are slim to none. So old Grammy's
                    going all in on Big Slick.
          
          Everyone looks at Kirk who is stunned.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm proud of you, Kirk. Don't let
                    your old Grammy down. Do something
                    good with it.
          
          She blows a kiss, lifts the remote and aims it at the camera.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for Christ sakes!
          
          She throws the remote at the lens.    The picture goes to snow.
          
                              ERIC
                    So Kirk gets it all!?   That is
                    bullshit!
          
                              KIRK
                    Eric, it can't be much.
          
                              ERIC
                    Well!?
          
          Maury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers.    He
          dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic.
          
                              MAURY
                    Let's see here... Looks like she
                    had herself six G's in savings.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  41.
          
                              MAURY (CONT'D)
                    Um, another three grand in bonds,
                    give or take. Her life insurance
                    will pay pert-near seventy grand.
          
          He adds this up on an old adding machine (the kind with the
          hand crank) and writes $77,800 on a chalk board, which is
          mounted on the wall behind him.
          
                              ERIC
                    She left him eighty grand!?
          
                              MAURY
                    Most of Stella's retirement home
                    expenses were covered by her reverse
                    mortgage. But, figure in thirty
                    thousand still due to Arborwood
                    Village. She racked up forty-seven
                    thousand in medical bills. And my
                    fee, of course, which now stands at
                    two thousand and change - which is
                    real reasonable, folks.
          
          He writes "Liabilities = $79,000    Total -$1,200."
          
                              ERIC
                    So Kirk owes money!? HA! Shit,
                    man! That is God damn hilarious!
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          The upscale restaurant is crowded. Kirk and Molly are eating
          at a small table. Kirk is not relaxed like he had been the
          last time they ate together. He is sweating and trying to
          remain cool. The Maitre d is eyeing them suspiciously.
          
                              MOLLY
                    But, you can't legally be held
                    responsible for her debt. What
                    kind of hack is this attorney?
          
                                 KIRK
                    It's okay.     I had it in savings.
          
          The waiter brings a drink to Molly.
          
                               WAITER
                        (French accent)
                    Madame. From ze gentleman in ze
                    grey suit.
          
          From his table, a good looking man smiles and raises a drink
          to Molly. She nods back - polite but annoyed.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Anyway... Grammy hated owing anyone
                    money. I'm afraid she couldn't
                    rest if she wasn't square with the
                    house. It's the least I can do.
                    She practically raised me.
          
                              MOLLY
                    You're a good man, Kirk.
          
          Molly smiles and takes his hands. The maitre d is watching
          and getting angry. The waiter returns with another drink.
          
                              WAITER
                    From ze gentleman in ze purple tie.
          
          Another guy raises his glass to her from the bar. Molly is
          getting irritated. Kirk is feeling smaller every minute.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Listen, no more drinks.    Please.
          
                                 WAITER
                    Of course.     No more drinks, madame.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    I'm sorry.     This happens sometimes.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, I get that a lot too. I'm
                    sure the next one will be for me.
          
          Molly laughs. The best looking man Kirk has ever seen walks
          up to the table. He and Molly hug.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, my gosh! Talon! I didn't
                    realize you were in town already.
          
                              TALON
                    I just flew in this morning.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, this is Talon.    This is my
                    good friend, Kirk.
          
                              TALON
                    Great to meet you, sir.
          
          Talon gives Kirk a winning handshake, complete with wink.
          
                                                                  43.
          
          
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    So, do we have you for our Disabled
                    Angels Program again this year?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Wouldn't miss it.
          
                              TALON
                    That's fantastic. (to Kirk) Mol is
                    always a big hit with the kids.
          
                               MOLLY
                    Please. You're the one the kids go
                    crazy for.
          
                              KIRK
                    So you two work together?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Only once a year. Talon is our
                    charity liaison at the air show.
          
                                TALON
                    And?
          
                              MOLLY
                    And my ex-boyfriend.
          
          Kirk starts to choke. He grabs his water glass and takes a
          swig but the ice collapses and the water pours all over him.
          
                               KIRK
                    Oh, boy.   I guess I better...
          
          Kirk heads off to the bathroom, muttering to himself.
          
                                KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Stupid.    Stupid. Stupid.
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT MEN'S ROOM
          
          Kirk is drying his shirt. A man is still zipping up as he
          takes the next sink. Before washing, he offers a handshake.
          
                              MAX
                    Excuse me. My name is Max Fleming.
                    I'm a financial planner.
          
          Kirk takes the handshake reluctantly and then gets a business
          card. Max then starts to wash up - so does Kirk.
          
                                KIRK
                    Oh, Hi.
          
                                                                     44.
          
          
          
                              MAX
                    Please forgive me but I'm curious.
                    Who manages your portfolio?
          
                              KIRK
                    My portfolio? I don't really...
          
          Max takes the last paper towel - forcing Kirk to drip dry.
          
                              MAX
                    It's okay if you'd rather not say. I
                    admit that selling my services in a
                    men's room is a tad aggressive but
                    isn't that what a man of your means
                    requires in his financial planner?
          
                                KIRK
                    My means.
          
                              MAX
                    Judging by the company you're
                    keeping, I'd say that you're making
                    a handsome living. I can help you
                    do even better.
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT RESTROOM HALL
          
          Kirk exits reading Max's card - somewhat bewildered. The
          Maitre d stops Kirk and speaks in a French accent.
          
                              MAITRE D
                    Excusez-moi Monsieur.   Might I have
                    a word?
          
                                KIRK
                    Oh, sure.    Is everything all right?
          
          The Maitre d looks around and then leans in and speaks
          quietly - now without the French accent.
          
                              MAITRE D
                    My kids eat here. My mother's here
                    right now you son of a bitch.
          
                               KIRK
                    Okay.   Did I...
          
                              MAITRE D
                    Look, I can appreciate that this is
                    not some common street-walker.
                    You're obviously willing to pay for
                    the best but we can't have this
                    kind of thing at my place.
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    What? I'm not paying anyone.
                    We're just on a date.
          
                              MAITRE D
                    You are on a date with her? What
                    am I an idiot? Now, I don't wish
                    to embarrass you, sir, or make a
                    scene. So, enjoy your dinner but,
                    be warned, do not ever bring
                    another professional into my place.
                    (louder and back into the French
                    accent) Tres bien Monsieur!
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT
          
          When Kirk rounds the corner, he sees that Molly and Talon are
          still talking. Kirk hides behind a plant. Molly is beaming.
          She stands to hug Talon and kiss his cheek before he exits
          the restaurant. Kirk returns to the table.
          
                               KIRK
                    Oh, no.   Did I miss Talon?
          
                              MOLLY
                    He had to go but he asked me tell
                    you how much he enjoyed meeting you.
          
                               KIRK
                    Yeah. Super. He, uh, seems like a
                    great guy.
          
                              MOLLY
                    He is. He's wonderful. I know, I
                    know - the blue eyes and the rock
                    hard abs, right? But he's really
                    so much more than that. A gallery
                    in New York just opened an exhibit
                    of his photography. He's a genius.

                        (to the waiter)
                    Can we get the check?
          
                              WAITER
                    Madame, your bill has been covered
                    by ze woman in ze Raiders Jacket.
          
          A butch woman in the bar raises a glass in Molly's direction.
          
          INT. MOLLY'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Molly and Kirk pull into a parking lot.
          
                                                                     46.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh my gosh! This is your
                    apartment? I used to live in this
                    neighborhood back in college.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, I'm gonna move to a better
                    place pretty soon.
          
                              MOLLY
                    We used to come to parties over
                    here sometimes. Oooohh. Can I
                    come up and see your place?
          
          EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          It's Friday night and several college parties are raging in
          the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the
          balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college
          students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a
          bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of
          Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          Kirk and Molly enter.   The apartment is neat, clean and
          fairly sparse.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's not much, I know.
          
                              MOLLY
                    No, I like it!
          
          Molly walks around and examines certain items. Kirk quietly
          hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer
          desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears.
          Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer
          comes to life, revealing a "Hot Back-Door Asians" website.
          Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the
          monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She
          moves on to a rack of DVDs.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Wow, we have a lot of the same
                    DVDs. Life of Brian, Cool Hand
                    Luke, Family Guy... Beaches, Kirk?
          
                               KIRK
                    What?   It's a good movie.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I love that movie.
          
                                                                 47.
          
          
          
          She spots a crate full of vinyl records.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Wow, records. No Way! Look at all
                    this Cheap Trick!

                              MOLLY
                    Are you kidding? Heaven Tonight is
                    the first album I ever owned! A
                    hand-me-down from my big sister.
                    She was the coolest person in the
                    whole world.
          
          She notices an upright piano in the corner.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    You play the piano?
          
                              KIRK
                    A little. My grandma taught me.
                    It was kind of our thing. She was
                    a great player. Ragtime, show
                    tunes, that kind of thing. I'm
                    really not very good.
          
          She plops down on the couch.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, I'll bet you're great.   Play
                    something for me.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, I can't really play in front of
                    people.
          
                              MOLLY
                    What, the stage fright thing?    Come
                    on it's just me. Please?
          
                              KIRK
                    No, I really can't. Trust me,
                    you're not missing anything.
          
          Kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into
          a little dance of almost sitting. He finally commits to sit.
          
                              MOLLY
                    So you've never played in front of
                    anyone?
          
                                                                 48.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Nope. Almost did once. A talent
                    show in high school. I just sat up
                    there drenched in sweat. I really
                    thought I could do it but then I
                    made my big mistake.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Let me guess. You looked at the
                    audience.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yep. All these eyes on me. I'm
                    shaking, my head is spinning, I'm
                    trying to remember if I even play
                    the piano... and then, I puked.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Right there on the stage?
          
                              KIRK
                    INTO the piano actually.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Shut up! You're lying!      Why would
                    you do that?
          
                              KIRK
                    It was a reflex. I was trying not
                    to barf on the floor. Turns out
                    it's a lot easier to clean puke off
                    a stage than out of a baby grand.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Yeah, that has to be a real bitch.
                    Oh, I shouldn't be laughing. You
                    poor thing.
          
          Molly brushes his hair back with her hand. Kirk is frozen
          with fear. Molly leans in. Kirk also leans in but not too
          far. Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make
          this official. She takes him by the collar, reels him in and
          kisses him. They make out for a moment. Kirk is near panic
          but he does his best to keep it together.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry. I'm a little cotton-mouthed.
                    I'm going to get a glass of water.
                    How 'bout for you? Water? A nice
                    glass of, you know...water?
          
                               MOLLY
                    Yeah.   That sounds good.
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          
          Kirk steps away from her and disappears into...
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
          
          He pours a glass of water. He's about to return when he sees
          his reflection in the window. The boner under his khakis is
          not subtle. He looks down and starts to panic.
          
                              KIRK
                    Um... You want anything to eat?
          
                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                    No thanks.
          
          Kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in. He takes a
          few deep, calming breaths.   He closes the fridge - still at
          full alert. Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building.
          He grabs a Time Magazine. He flips through frantically. He
          turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal
          women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh come on!
          
          He is sweating like crazy.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    Can I give you a hand?
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   I got it!
          
          Kirk finally flips to a picture of Barbara Bush.   He stares
          at it hard. His boner begins to retreat.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
                              MOLLY
                    Listen Kirk, I want you to know
                    that I would really like to, you
                    know, to be with you tonight.
          
                                 KIRK (O.S.)
                    Really?
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
          
          The boner pops back up. Kirk silently mouths, "MOTHERFUCKER!"
          at his mischievous little man.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    Well, sure. But... I just don't
                    think I'm ready yet.
          
                                                                 50.
          
          
          
          Kirk's reply is rushed with enthusiastic relief.
          
                             KIRK
                    Sure! Sure! Yeah! No problem!
                    Great! That's...that's great!
                    Ice!? You want some ice!?
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    Sure.
          
          Kirk opens the freezer. He puts a few cubes in her water and
          then grabs a fistful and shoves his hand in his pants.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          Molly gets cozy on the couch and looks even sexier.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I mean, don't get me wrong. I want
                    to! Believe me - getting naked and
                    crazy sounds fantastic right now.
          
                              KIRK (O.S.)
                    Shit!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Are you okay?
          
                              KIRK (O.S.)
                    Yeah, fine.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
          
          Kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink. He finds
          duct tape. He pulls some tape off the roll. It makes a loud
          noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up. Kirk
          opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot. He
          coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    I just think we should get to know
                    each other first.   I'm no prude.
                    I mean, I'm pretty generous in bed.
                    Once I trust a person, I like to
                    experiment and get pretty wild.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, dear God.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    But, I just need to feel safe
                    first.
          
                                                                   51.
          
          
          
          Kirk finishes taping up, zips his pants and checks his
          profile in the reflection from the window.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          Kirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner.
          
                               KIRK
                    Hey.   I'm totally fine with that.
          
                              MOLLY
                    You're the best.
          
          Kirk gives an "aw-shucks" head tilt.    Molly stands.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, well, I'd better go then.
          
          They walk to the door. Molly leans in and they kiss a few
          moments more. Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little
          snug. She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to
          retrieve them. Suddenly she starts coughing. She puts her
          fist over her mouth.
          
          Kirk's POV:   As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch.
          
          Kirk winces again. She hears the tape start to give way.
          She looks up, slightly confused. Kirk looks around as though
          he's looking for the source of the sound. Molly stands.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I had a really nice time.    I'll
                    call you tomorrow.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Great!
          
          Kirk opens the door for Molly.
          
          EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          As Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss. Two studly male
          college students are playing foosball on their patio. They
          stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk.
          Molly trots off.
          
                                 COLLEGE STUDENT #1
                    Damn, man!     That chick is fine!
          
          Kirk returns a cool "whassup" nod to the guys.
          
                              COLLEGE STUDENT #2
                    All right Mr. Kettner!
          
                                                                   52.
          
          
          
                              COLLEGE STUDENT #1
                    You wanna play some foos!?
          
                              KIRK
                    No thanks fellas.
          
          Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          He drifts over to his piano and sits down. The joy of what
          has just happened is plastered on his face. He launches into
          a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp. Soon a
          neighbor is pounding on the wall. Kirk stops playing.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry, Mrs. Neusbaum!
          
          Kirk continues his celebration, dancing around the apartment.
          He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Ron seems like a swell guy. I love
                    Pizza Hut. What? Who's this?
                    Why, this is my girlfriend, Molly.
                    Oh, don't be that way. Oh, there,
                    there, now. Here's a tissue.
          
          He drops the picture and continues the dance.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile
          continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk
          sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open
          like a shot and he reaches for his phone - "No Missed Calls."
          
          MONTAGE OVER MUSIC:
          
          1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom.   He checks his
          gut and hairline in the mirror.
          
          2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the
          box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached
          along with a card that reads, "Happy Graduation - Love Mom
          and Dad." He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads
          the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor.
          He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses
          underneath him. He checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
          
          3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the
          cupboards.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl.
          He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal
          and then checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
          
          3) He surfs the web. He reads info on the Hair Club For Men
          site. He moves to Hot_or_Not.com. The first woman is very
          pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and
          gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her
          score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten.
          He checks his phone. He moves on to "BackDoorAsians.com."
          
          4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower
          third reads, "AMC's 24 Hours of Bond." No Missed Calls. The
          sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls.
          Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them
          as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching
          Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is
          creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is
          still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls.
          
          5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess -
          tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the
          magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous
          picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur
          Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his
          own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack.
          
          6) Kirk is walking home. Every street sign, billboard and T-
          shirt he sees reads, "NO MISSED CALLS."
          
          MUSIC FADES OUT
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY
          
          He stands in the shower sulking. He hears the phone ring in
          the next room. He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts
          to dry off as he runs into the bedroom. He reaches the
          charger base but the phone is not there. He stands and
          listens hard to the ringing. He runs into the living room.
          Angle on the phone. It's hiding under a pillow on the couch.
          In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up
          papers and magazines. The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's
          panic increases until he finally spots the phone. Kirk dives
          for it, losing his towel in the process.
          
                               KIRK
                    Hello!?   Hello!?
          
                              STAINER (V.O.)
                    Took you long enough. What were
                    you doing, taking a growler?
          
          Kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him.   She
          can see his ass through the window. He covers up.
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry, Mrs. Nuesbaum.
          
          EXT. DOWNTOWN SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY
          
          Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the
          shops and restaurants. Kirk holds a stack of flyers for
          Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer
          who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirk, it's a simple rule of life.
                    Look around. People are pretty
                    evenly matched.
          
          Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus
          stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk.
          Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty,
          ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one
                    who asked me out. So, why...
          
                              STAINER
                    That first night, were you
                    intimidated by her?
          
                              KIRK
                    No, I didn't think I had a chance.
          
                             STAINER
                    Exactly. So you were relaxed and
                    funny. You were on.
          
          Stainer posts several "Wheel in the Sky" flyers on a kiosk.
          
                              KIRK
                    So I gotta get back to that.
          
                              STAINER
                    That's just it, Kirky. Now that
                    she's opened the door, you can't
                    get back to that.
          
                              KIRK
                    So I'll have to fake it?
          
                              STAINER
                    Forget it. You can't fake that
                    far. A broad like her - she'll
                    smell that horseshit a mile away.
          
                                                                  55.
          
          
          
          Kirk and Stainer enter a...
          
          EXT. CAFE FRONT PATIO
          
          ...and take a table on the crowded patio.
          
                              STAINER
                    Can we get a couple of menus?
                    (then to Kirk) You eating?
          
                              KIRK
                    Maybe just a salad.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, one salad ain't going make up
                    for thirty years of chili dogs.
          
                              KIRK
                    I know. But I got dinner with my
                    folks later.
          
                              STAINER
                    Fun. Be sure and stab your brother
                    in the eye with a fork for me.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry, Eric's not coming tonight.
          
          Kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with
          knockout girl) who pass Kirk and Stainer's table on their way
          to the valet stand. Stainer rolls his eyes.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    You know what - this is ridiculous.
                    I'm just going to call her.
          
                              STAINER
                    Fuck you are! Put that thing away.
                    You do not call her. Don't you get
                    it? Talon is back in town.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, she broke up with him.
          
                              STAINER
                    So, you're telling me you were
                    sitting there, a sweating,
                    quivering stutter-bucket and when
                    you came back from the can, Molly's
                    hugging a guy who's so good looking
                    you'd probably fuck him. What do
                    you think she's doing this weekend?
          
                                                                   56.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    So what am I supposed to do?
          
                              STAINER
                    What can you do? She hasn't called
                    - she's not going to.
          
                              KIRK
                    You're probably right.
          
                              STAINER
                    Just count yourself lucky. You got
                    to kiss a goddess and you got out
                    before she recalibrated your
                    hardware. A chick like that can
                    raise the bar too high and then
                    once she dumps you, nobody else
                    measures up.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, you're right. You know what -
                    it's good. It's better. I'm
                    actually relieved. You should have
                    seen this Talon guy. Man! All
                    I've been thinking about is having
                    to be naked in front of her. I
                    don't need that kind of pressure.
          
          The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and
          the nerdy guy opens the door for her. Stainer shakes his
          head as if to say, "Was there even a doubt?"
          
          Kirk's phone is sitting on the table - it rings.   Kirk and
          Stainer can see Molly's name on the caller ID.
          
                              STAINER
                    Don't do it!
          
          The phone rings again. Kirk glances down at the phone.
          Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk. RING! Close on Kirk's
          eyes turning weak. RING! Close on Stainer's threatening
          eyes. RING! Kirk gives up and looks away. Stainer's eyes
          calm. Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's
          wrist, pinning it to the table. RING!
          
                              KIRK
                    Cut it out!
          
                                 STAINER
                    Let it go!
          
                                                                    57.
          
          
          
          RING! Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but
          Stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around
          like battling snakes. Kirk presses the button to answer the
          call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hello!?... Oh, no problem! Yeah I
                    was super busy yesterday anyway.
          
                              STAINER
                    Would you look at yourself?
          
          Stainer lets go and Kirk sits up and backs away.
          
                              KIRK
                    Well, I have dinner with my folks
                    tonight... Oh, I wouldn't want to
                    subject you to them... Okay. If
                    you want to. I can pick you up...
          
          Kirk gives a confident smile and an "I told you she'd call"
          nod. Stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Oh, sure. Well then let me call
                    you back in a few minutes and I'll
                    give you directions. Alrighty.
                    Yeah. Buh-bye.
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, I guess you just solved that.
                    An hour with your family and she'll
                    file for a restraining order.
          
                              KIRK
                    No. Eric's not going to be there.
                    It's going to be good. You might

          over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk.
          
                              STAINER
                        (to the boy)
                    Whoa! I don't think so Spanky!   A
                    little lower!
          
          The boy instead posts it over a "Walk For a Cure" poster.
          
          EXT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING
          
          Molly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a
          quaint residential street.
          
                                                                     58.
          
          
          She climbs out of her car, checking the address on a small
          sheet of paper. She sees Kirk sitting on the front porch.
          
                              KIRK
                    You found it!
          
                              MOLLY
                    I had good directions!
          
          She steps up the front walk toward Kirk, who points to a
          little yellow note taped to the front door.
          
                              KIRK
                    I'm sorry. My folks aren't back
                    yet. We're locked out.
          
                              MOLLY
                    You don't have a key?
          
                              KIRK
                    No. My dad's kind of obsessed with
                    home-security. Like someone's
                    going to break in and steal his
                    Reader's Digest collection.
          
          A very old man wobbles out of the house next door with a
          beagle on a leash. The man struggles a bit with the dog.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Hi, Mr. Riley!
          
                              MR. RILEY
                    Well, howdy Kirk!
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey, what do say you take the night
                    off and I'll take Noodle around the
                    block for you? (to Molly) Are you
                    up for a walk?
          
                              MOLLY
                    That sounds great.
          
                              MR. RILEY
                    Geeze Kirk, that's mighty nice.
          
          Kirk jogs over to take the leash.   Noodle jumps up on Kirk.
          He and Molly pet the excited dog.
          
                              KIRK
                        (baby talk)
                    Yes! Always happy to see you,
                    pretty girl! Yes you are a pretty
                    girl! Yes you are!
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
          
          Molly takes note - animal lover - big points.
          
                              MR. RILEY
                    You're a good boy, Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's no trouble at all.
          
          Molly and Kirk start down the sidewalk with Noodle. An old
          woman comes out of the next house with her dog on a leash.
          
                               OLD WOMAN
                    Honey!?   Are you back in business!?
          
                              KIRK
                        (To Molly)
                    I had a little neighborhood dog-
                    walking service when I was a kid .
                    (to the woman) No problem, Mrs. D,
                    we can take Norton along too!
          
          Several soft-faded cuts as Kirk and Molly move through the
          neighborhood. Soon they have a third dog. Kirk points out
          landmarks as they talk and laugh. Now they have a fourth
          dog. Molly takes his arm.
          
          The evening light is a bit dimmer as they give Noodle back to
          Mr. Riley. Kirk turns toward his parents' house. Now
          there's a car parked in the driveway and a jacked-up, knobby-
          tired pick-up parked out front. The truck has two bumper
          stickers ("One Nation Under GOD!" and "No Fat Chicks!")
          flanking a vanity license plate that reads, "ERIX-TOY."
          Kirk's shoulders slump at the sight of it.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you know what I'm thinking,
                    let's go get Chinese.
          
                              MOLLY
                    What are you talking about?   I want
                    to meet your family.
          
          They start toward the door.   Molly's cell phone rings.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I'm so sorry. It's Patty. I've
                    got to take this. Go ahead. I'll
                    be right in.
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING
          
          Kirk comes through the front door to find his father in the
          living room watching a hockey game.
          
                                                                     60.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                    Hey dad.
          
                              MR. KETTNER
                        (without looking up)
                    Kirk.
          
                              MRS. KETTNER (O.S.)
                    Hi sweetie!
          
          Eric steps out of the kitchen with three beers.
          
                              ERIC
                    Close the door, fucknut.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey Eric. I thought you were
                    hanging drywall tonight.
          
                              ERIC
                    Nah. Fuckin' Leroy fired me again.
                    Like that dick never came to work
                    with a little buzz on.
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, listen, I brought a date
                    tonight. I really like her.
                    Please don't embarrass me in front
                    of her. I'll do anything you want.
          
                              ERIC
                    I promise I won't mention her
                    goiter.
          
          Eric and Dad crack up.
          
          A flushing sound and then Ron comes out of the bathroom.
          He's buckling up. Kirk's shoulders drop again.
          
                              RON
                    I did like you said Mr. K.
          
          Eric tosses Ron and Mr. Kettner each a beer.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, hey Ron. So Marnie's here?
          
          Marnie appears in the door of the kitchen. She's holding a
          corningware pot filled with mashed potatoes.
          
          Molly finishes her call. She's up the front steps and Kirk
          lets her in. Eric, Ron and Mr. Kettner are stunned. Marnie
          drops the pot and it smashes on the floor in front of her.
          
                                                                     61.
          
          
          Mrs. Kettner and Debbie rush out to see what Marnie is gaping
          at. Debbie (still pregnant) is immediately threatened by the
          way Eric is looking at Molly.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Everyone, this is Molly McCall.
          
          Kirk's never seen his family so impressed. He can't hide his
          grin. Ron pops the cap off his beer and it overflows a bit.
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Kirk, Molly, Mr. & Mrs. Kettner, Marnie, Ron and Debbie sit
          around the kitchen table and feast on a meatloaf dinner.
          Eric is at the fridge grabbing a beer. Marnie is angrily
          watching Ron whose eyes are all over Molly.
          
                              ERIC
                    You want another one Dad?
          
                              MR. KETTNER
                    You read my mind.
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    You two take it easy now. We have
                    guests. (THEN) Eric honey, I'm
                    sure if you apologize to Leroy,
                    he'll take you back.
          
          Eric returns to the table with the beers.
          
                              ERIC
                    Nah, fuck him. Anyways, Leroy ain't
                    payin' shit ever since he trucked
                    in all those spics from Fresno.
          
                              KIRK
                    Geeze Eric!
          
          Ron looks offended and raises a palm to indicate that...
          
                              RON
                    I got this, Kirk. Eric, before you
                    go bad-mouthin' a whole group of
                    people, you should know that my
                    grandmother on my father's side is
                    from Fresno.
          
                              ERIC
                    Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
                    (THEN) So, Molly. What do you do?
          
                              MOLLY
                    I'm an event planner.

                    That's a business to get into.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Well, thank you Eric.
          
                              ERIC
                    Book a band, blow up a few balloons
                    and people pay out the ass for it.
          
                              KIRK
                    There's a little more to it than
                    that, Eric. Molly handles some big
                    events. She's even doing a benefit
                    with Billy Joel next month.
          
                              MOLLY
                        (PLAYFULLY)
                    Actually, Eric's right.   Just a few
                    balloons.
          
          Molly smiles to reassure Kirk that she can handle herself.

                    So, Molly, me and Debbie here are
                    getting hitched. What do you get
                    for a wedding job?
          
          Kirk raises his eyebrows into "please-behave-yourself" puppy
          dog eyes. Eric shoots back an "oh whatever" sneer.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Hmmm. Honestly, I don't really do a
                    lot of weddings. I specialize more
                    in fund-raisers, corporate events,
                    that kind of thing.

          I've done a few.

          Don't get your panties in a wad,
          Kirk. He's just making
          conversation.
          
                    MOLLY
          Geeze, there are so many factors
          that affect the cost of a wedding.

          So what's the damage for
          supervising something like that?
          
                    KIRK
          Eric, please.

          I'm just talkin' ballpark. I'm
          ain't gonna try and Jew her down.
          
                                                                  64.

                    Okay. Before expenses, my base fee
                    for a non-charity event is fifteen
                    thousand. So, I'd ballpark that
                    somewhere around twenty-five grand.

                    Fuck a duck.
          
          For a moment everyone is chewing and there is a break in the
          conversation. Kirk is getting wound up tighter and tighter.
          
                              ERIC (CONT'D)
                    So you're making a comfortable
                    living, you seem like you got your
                    head together more or less and
                    Christ, look at ya. What the hell
                    you doing with numbnuts here?
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    Eric!
          
                              ERIC
                    Come on, Ma - we're all thinking it.
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    Molly, I'm so sorry.
          
                              MOLLY
                    No, it's fine. The truth is, Kirk
                    and I are just getting to know one
                    another but so far, I think he's
                    decent, he's funny and... You
                    know, when we first met, Kirk asked
                    me in all sincerity if I knew how
                    to do an oil change.
          
          Eric, Ron and Mr. Kettner each let out a quick burst of "yeah
          right" laughter.
          
                             MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I know! And, you're right, I don't
                    but... I just love that he asked.
          
          A moment passes as they all process this. The women at the
          table all know exactly what Molly means. The men are simply
          confused.
          
                              ERIC
                    Funny? Kirk is funny?    Tell us a
                    joke there Sinbad.
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    (to Kirk) Well I hope you can hold
                    onto this one pumpkin. (to Molly)
                    When Marnie broke up with him he
                    was devastated for months, the poor
                    little guy.
          
          Marnie looks up, surprised and touched by the comment.   Kirk
          is mortified.
          
                              ERIC
                    No shit, when you dump him, he's
                    liable to kill himself.
          
          Kirk rubs his own head to keep it from exploding. Molly calms
          him with a hand on his back. This move isn't lost on Marnie.
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Kirk splashes water on his face and then looks for a towel
          but can't find one. He's forced to use his sleeve. He is a
          wreck. He takes a deep breath and steps out into...
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME ENTRY HALL
          
          ...to find Marnie at the front door putting her coat on.
          
                              KIRK
                    Are you heading home?
          
                              MARNIE
                    Got to get home and let Peanut out.
                    (she wipes some lint off of Kirk's
                    shirt sleeve.) Kirk, you look
                    really good.
          
                               KIRK
                    Thanks.   You do too.
          
          Marnie smiles a sad smile.
          
                               MARNIE
                    Ron!   Let's go!
          
                              RON
                    I'm coming! It was really
                    fantastic to meet you Molly.   If
                    you ever need a pizza...
          
          Ron gives Molly a hug that makes Marnie as uncomfortable as
          it does Molly. He then passes Kirk as he crosses to the
          front door, carrying a pile of foiled over paper plates.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          
                              RON (CONT'D)
                    Cripes Kirk! Crack a window in
                    there pirate! HAHAHA!
          
          Ron and Marnie exit.   Kirk walks back into...
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' KITCHEN
          
          Mrs. Kettner and Molly are cleaning up.
          
                              KIRK
                    Molly, you don't have to do that.
          
                              MOLLY
                    No, It's fine.
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    You let us have some girl time.
                    Take these downstairs to your dad.
          
          She hands Kirk a bag of Fritos and shoes him through the
          basement door.
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' BASEMENT - NIGHT
          
          Kirk's father has built a tacky little basement bar decorated
          with neon beer signs and Eric's old trophies and ribbons.
          Mr. Kettner and Debbie sit at the bar and smoke as Eric
          stands behind the bar and serves them cocktails. Kirk comes
          down the basement stairs and joins them. The hockey game
          wrap-up highlights are running on a TV mounted above the bar.

                    Now don't be that way, boy. All
                    your big brother is trying to say
                    is that we're worried about you.

                    You show up here with that piece of
                    ass!? Either you're fucking with

                    all agree that Debbie here is one
                    wicked hot box.
          
          Debbie smiles and squeezes Eric's hand. Mr. Kettner nods and
          raises his glass.
          
                              KIRK
                    She's um... very attractive.

                    Yeah, and this Molly makes her look
                    like a pig.
          
          Debbie lets go of Eric's hand and storms upstairs.
          
                              ERIC (CONT'D)

                    sit still for it.

                    and it's all going to be over any
                    minute but, Jesus Christ! She'll
                    come to her senses without any help
                    from you! She's up there with...
          
          Kirk turns to point up the stairs. As he glances back, he
          finds Molly standing on the steps listening and frowning down
          at him. Before Kirk can get a word out, Molly storms out of
          the house. Kirk runs upstairs but she's in her car before he
          can get out the front door. Eric appears behind him.
          
                              ERIC
                    Way to go numbnuts. You should
                    have let me handle it.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Kirk stands at work, searching Habib's bag and looking
          grouchy. Fuller monitors Kirk, arms crossed. Habib lets out
          a long irritated sigh.
          
                               KIRK
                    I know.   I'm sorry, man.
          
          Kirk hands the bag back to Habib and sends him on his way.
          Randy, another agent, hands Kirk a note.
          
          INSERT: The note reads, "Kirk, We need to talk.     I'm in the
          food court. -M."
          
          Kirk sighs.   Stainer is now reading over Kirk's shoulder.
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, I guess this is it. I'm
                    surprised she even bothered.
          
          INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT
          
          The food court is crowded.     Kirk looks around for Molly but
          does not see her.
          
                                                                  69.

                    Good, you got my note.
          
          Kirk turns to find Marnie sitting at a table working on a
          Burrito Supreme.
          
                                    KIRK

                    I'm sorry to bug you at work but
                    this couldn't wait.
          
          Kirk sits down.
          
                              MARNIE (CONT'D)
                    Kirk, I think I messed up. I see a
                    change in you and I like it. So, I
                    was thinking that we should
                    maybe... get back together. Just
                    to try it out, you know?
          
                                KIRK
                    Wow.    I don't know, Marnie.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Why not? Please don't say it's
                    because of this Molly person.
          
                               KIRK
                    No, I think I already screwed that
                    up anyway.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Good. I was really worried about
                    you with her. She seems like kind
                    of a bitch.
          
                                KIRK
                    What?    She is not.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Well, she acts like she's better
                    than everyone with her hybrid car
                    and her la-de-da charity work.
          
                              KIRK
                    She doesn't do that at all, Marnie.
                    You're just putting that on her.
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          
                              MARNIE
                    Okay, maybe so. See? This is what
                    I mean. You never argued with me
                    before. You're really growing.
          
                              KIRK
                    What about Ron?
          
                              MARNIE
                    If you want to get back together,
                    of course, I'll break up with Ron.
          
                              KIRK
                    You mean you're still with him?
          
                              MARNIE
                    I'm not going to risk being all
                    alone just because you don't know
                    what's good for you. Come on,
                    Kirk. Deep down, you know where
                    you belong.
          
                              KIRK
                    You're right, I think I do.   Say hi
                    to Ron for me.
          
          Kirk stands and walks away.
          
          EXT. AIR SHOW ENTRANCE - DAY
          
          Kirk and Stainer are at the ticket gate. Kirk pays for his
          ticket but Stainer stands staring at him.
          
                              KIRK
                    What?
          
                              STAINER
                    This wasn't my idea. I ain't
                    dropping twenty bucks to go in
                    there. God-damned planes are in
                    the sky. I can see 'em just fine
                    from the parking lot for free.
          
          Kirk begrudgingly buys Stainer a ticket.
          
          EXT. AIR SHOW
          
          Kirk and Stainer move through the crowd. Stainer now carries
          a corn dog, a giant soda and an armload of Air Show
          memorabilia, including an inflatable F/A-18 Hornet.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    She's working one of the kids'
                    charities. I'm guessing they might
                    be down by the rides.
          
                              STAINER
                    Whoa dude, check it out.   The Blue
                    Angels!
          
          Five men in flight suits and aviator sunglasses strut through
          the crowd in slow motion. They exude masculine confidence.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Those are the coolest guys in the
                    entire world. Think about it -
                    George Clooney or Derek Jeter would
                    trade places with those guys in a
                    second. Can you imagine the sheer
                    magnitude of puss those fuckers tag?
                    I'm gonna get 'em to sign my Hornet!
          
          Stainer runs toward them. He joins some kids and beautiful
          women who are already getting autographs.
          
          Kirk spots Molly working a charity booth. He crosses to her.
          She turns to him with a this-better-be-good stance.
          
                              KIRK
                    Molly.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    I just wanted to apologize for last
                    night... for my family.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Your family I can deal with.
          
                              KIRK
                    And for me... For what I said.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Do you really think I'm that
                    shallow? You think I need to slum?
          
                              KIRK
                    No. I don't know what to think.
                    You just have to understand that
                    this is a new area for me. Believe
                    it or not, I don't have gobs of
                    experience with beautiful women.
          
                                                                     72.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    Is that all I am to you?
          
                              KIRK
                    No, but I don't have much
                    experience with brilliant,
                    successful, wonderful women either.
          
          This melts Molly a bit.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, this can't work if you put me
                    up on some kind of pedestal.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's not that I... Okay, look...
                    When I was a kid, we played a lot
                    of baseball in my neighborhood.
                    The worst part was picking teams
                    because I was always picked last.
                    Every time. Like they couldn't
                    start a friggin' game without first
                    establishing how much I sucked.
                    So, now you come along and make me
                    feel like the first pick. But...
                    what if I can't hit?
          
          Molly softens and smiles.
          
                              MOLLY
                    You already got to first base.
                    Just keep your eye on the ball.
          
          Kirk nods and smiles back.   Molly steals a quick kiss.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Let me tie up a couple things and
                    I'll show you around the grounds.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sounds good.
          
          Molly goes into a tent to speak to Patty.    Kirk watches her
          with a calm, relieved smile.
          
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Boy, she sure is something, huh?
          
          Kirk turns toward the imposing Blue Angel pilot standing
          behind him. The pilot removes his shades - it's Talon.
          
                                                                  73.
          
          
          
                              TALON
                    It's Kirk right? (firm handshake)
                    Excellent to see you again, sir.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Oh, Talon.     You're a Blue Angel?
          
                              TALON
                    Yes sir, a Naval Aviator.
          
                              KIRK
                    Perfect. Okay, I get it - Talon is
                    what - your call-sign?
          
                              TALON
                    No, it's my name.
          
                              KIRK
                    Then what's your call-sign?
          
                              TALON
                    Oh, I'd rather not say. It's
                    embarrassing. Just something the
                    guys gave me...
          
          Talon puts his arm around Kirk and walks him away from the
          booth.
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    Anyway listen Kirk, is it fair to
                    say that you and Mol are close?
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, I guess.
          
                              TALON
                    Well, I understand that fellas like
                    yourself tend to have uniquely
                    candid relationships with the women
                    they befriend. Am I right?
          
                              KIRK
                    Fellas like myself?
          
                              TALON
                    Don't get me wrong. I have no
                    problem with your lifestyle. What
                    grown men do in the privacy of
                    their homes is none of my concern.
          
                              KIRK
                    Talon, I'm not...
          
                                                                     74.
          
          
          
                              TALON
                    Hey, I'm in the Navy. I don't ask
                    and I don't expect you to tell.
          
          Talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone.
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    Now, I don't know what Molly's told
                    you about me, but anything bad - I
                    deserve. I hurt that girl. I hurt
                    one of God's own angels and I've
                    regretted it every minute since.
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   She speaks very highly...
          
                              TALON
                    God as my witness, I WILL make it
                    right. I WILL get her back. Can I
                    count on you to put in the good
                    word for me, Poncho?
          
                              KIRK
                    Um... Sure.
          
                              TALON
                    You're the man. Come here.
          
          Talon embraces Kirk in a tight hug.
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    There you go. Feel the tolerance.
          
          Another Blue Angel calls over while signing Stainer's plane.
          
                             BLUE ANGEL #2
                    Yo! Foot-Long! We scramble in
                    ten.
          
                               TALON
                    Roger!
          
          Talon finishes the long hug. He and the other Blue Angels
          walk off in formation. Stainer rejoins Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    That was Talon.
          
                              STAINER
                    Who? The Blue Angel guy?    (cracking
                    up) Duuuuude!
          
          Molly joins them.
          
                                                                  75.
          
          
          
          MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE:
          
          1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd.
          Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on
          Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close
          on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate
          formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell
          out "MOLLY" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly
          (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his
          insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)
          
          2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes
          his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the
          screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.
          The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another
          man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and
          stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's
          gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind
          Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is
          oblivious to this exchange.
          
          3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has
          stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,
          he is tackled by two cops.
          
                                 COP
                       Nice try pervert!
          
          Molly spins around, horrified.
          
                                 COP (CONT'D)
                       It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of
                       shit was following you but we got
                       him.
          
          Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the
          cop's grasp.
          
          4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at
          the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal
          detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out
          of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels
          he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has
          come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and
          carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up
          and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.
          
          FADE MUSIC
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Dressed up and wearing party hats, Kirk, Stainer, Devon, Jack
          and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          
          The place is decorated with balloons and streamers.   A huge
          banner reads, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATIE!"
          
                              STAINER
                    Seriously, what's with the banner?
                    She's blind, right? Seems like
                    they could have saved a few bucks
                    there.
          
          Patty runs in.
          
                              PATTY
                    Here they come! Everybody hide!
          
                              STAINER
                    Is that really necessary?
          
                               KIRK
                    Stainer!   Just hide.
          
          They hide. Molly leads her sister, KATIE, into the
          restaurant. "Surprise!" Molly hugs Katie.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                        (to Stainer)
                    Still think she's Al Qaeda?
          
          Stainer brushes off the comment.   Molly waves Kirk over.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Katie, I'd like you to meet Kirk.
          
                              KATIE
                    It's so nice to meet you, I've
                    heard great things.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, thank you. Molly raves about
                    her big sister non-stop.
          
                                KATIE
                    May I?
          
          Katie reaches out to feel Kirk's face. She's a bit perplexed
          by the result. Two blind teenaged boys approach.
          
                              BLIND TEEN
                    Mrs. McCall?
          
                                KATIE
                    Robert!    Is Jerry with you?
          
                              JERRY
                    Yes, ma'am. Happy Birthday.
          
                                                                    77.
          
          
          
                              KATIE
                    It's so nice you came. (to Molly)
                    These are two of my star pupils,
                    Robert and Jerry. Boys, this is my
                    sister, Molly.
          
                              JERRY
                    It's nice to meet you.
          
          They each feel Molly's face and then start elbowing one
          another like a couple of horny construction workers.
          
          A cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but
          uncopyrighted birthday song. Katie blows out her candles.
          
                              MOLLY
                    What's your wish, Katie?
          
                              KATIE
                    I wish Kirk would play the piano
                    for me.
          
          Kirk's face drops. Molly kisses her sister on the forehead
          as she has obviously coached the response. Immediately Patty
          is behind Kirk, pushing him. Kirk tries to politely decline
          but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the
          piano bench. Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play.
          
                               KIRK
                    Really.   I can barely play.
          
                              KATIE
                    Come on, Kirk! For my birthday?
          
          Kirk is sweating. He reaches for the keys but he is now
          white as a ghost. Molly watches in suspense, rethinking
          what she's done. Kirk's hands shake. He moves them around,
          hunting for a place to begin. The party-goers stare and the
          room gets quiet. Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though
          he might vomit.
          
          Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar. Suddenly,
          a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound
          system. Katie jumps up to dance with her friends.
          
          Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off.    Talon
          appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.
          
                              TALON
                    It's okay Kirk. You'll rock us
                    next time right chief?
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, hey Talon. Thanks.
          
                              TALON
                    I'm glad you're here. I feel
                    terrible about our little
                    misunderstanding. I don't know
                    what had me thinking you were a gay
                    fella. Molly tells me you two have
                    been seeing each other.
          
          Patty passes between them and gives Talon a dirty look.
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    She's got every right. I'd hate me
                    too. (THEN) I want to congratulate
                    you, Poncho. You're the better man.
                    Now, I'll step aside and truly wish
                    you the best of luck. I wouldn't
                    wish losing that girl on my worst
                    foe. But, make no mistake, you blow
                    it and I'll be waiting in wings.
                    Love and war, right chief?
          
          Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute. Kirk holds
          his forced confidence until Talon departs. Once alone,
          Kirk's poise deflates and he plops down into a chair.
          
          The party goes on and Katie opens a small present.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, it's a DVD.
          
                              KATIE
                    Who's this from?
          
          Nobody claims it but Jack and Devon look at Stainer.
          
                               STAINER
                    What?   It's closed captioned.
          
          Patty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is
          away from the group. Across the room, Talon raises a glass
          to them. Patty gives Talon the finger.
          
                              KIRK
                    What did he do?
          
                              PATTY
                    Listen, Molly would kill me if she
                    knew I was telling you this but I'm
                    trying to do you a favor.
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                    Okay.
          
                              PATTY
                    Molly has this physical...um issue.
                    You know, kind of like a birth
                    defect?
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, my God.
          
                              PATTY
                    It's not a big deal but she's
                    really self-conscious about it.
                    Talon and some other guys she's
                    dated have been weirded out and
                    made her feel like a freak.
          
                              KIRK
                    What is it?
          
                              PATTY
                    It's better if she tells you but if
                    you can't deal with it, just get
                    lost now and don't put her through
                    that heartbreak again.
          
                               KIRK
                    No, no.   I wouldn't do that.
          
                              PATTY
                    Good. 'Cause if you do, it'll be
                    your last conscious act... (she
                    stands) Cake?
          
          Patty heads off to get some cake. Kirk sits, considering
          this information. He looks at Molly. She is wearing a small
          black dress. She looks perfect in every way. Kirk crosses
          the room and walks out to the...
          
          EXT. RESTAURANT FRONT SIDEWALK
          
          He throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance
          similar to the one he had done after their first kiss.
          
          Stainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and
          Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and
          peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys
          come around the front to join Kirk.
          
                               STAINER
                    Dude?
          
                                                                    80.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                        (playfully chipper)
                    My friends! Whassup Bitches!
          
                               DEVON
                    What?   What's going on?
          
                              KIRK
                    My troubles are over boys! It's
                    all going to work out! Check it
                    out - Molly has... Wait for it...
          
          Kirk pauses for dramatic effect and then puts his thumbs up.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    ...a birth defect!
          
                                 DEVON
                    Excuse me?
          
                              JACK
                    That's terrible.
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   That's awesome!   Don't you get
                    it?
          
                                 DEVON
                    Ahhhh No.
          
                              STAINER
                    Sure, I get it. She needs a good
                    guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she
                    dates can't handle it, right?
          
                              KIRK
                    It sent Talon packing.
          
          Kirk and Stainer high five.    Jack and Devon look disturbed.
          
                              DEVON
                    Well, what's wrong with her?
          
                              KIRK
                    I don't know yet. Patty just said
                    she had a physical issue.
          
                              DEVON
                    Well that could be anything. Did
                    she say it was a birth defect?
          
                                                                 81.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    She said it was, "something like a
                    birth defect."
          
                              JACK
                    What if it's something really bad?
          
                              KIRK
                    I hope it is. I hope it's
                    something that would make most guys
                    run screaming. It won't matter to
                    me. I love her.
          
                              JACK
                    That's cool that you love her but
                    it's pretty fucked up to be rooting
                    for a harsh deformity.
          
                              DEVON
                    Oh, wow. What if this is Patty's way
                    of telling you that Molly is a man?
          
                              STAINER
                    Hey, if that chick has a dick, I'll
                    suck it!
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Kirk and Molly are cleaning up after the party. Kirk is
          relaxed and in a fantastic mood. Patty gets her coat and
          hugs Molly before exiting. Molly sheepishly approaches Kirk.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, I'm so sorry about the piano
                    thing. It was stupid of me.
          
                              KIRK
                    No. I know what you were trying to
                    do. It's okay. I wish I could
                    have played for her but...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Well, anyway, thanks for all your
                    help with Katie's party. I know it
                    meant a lot to her.
          
          Molly kisses Kirk. Now he's calm and kisses her back
          passionately. She smiles a naughty smile at him.
          
                               MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Tonight?
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                    Tonight.
          
          They start cleaning up as fast as they can.   Kirk is beaming!
          
          INT. MOLLY'S CONDO - NIGHT
          
          MONTAGE OVER LOVE SONG:
          
          Kirk and Molly enter her modern, luxurious condo.   Kirk takes
          her coat. They kiss.
          
          Kirk opens a bottle of wine.   He pours one glass to share.
          
          They sit on the couch talking. Kirk is on!    He is confident
          and silly and Molly is eating it up.
          
          They are making out passionately on the couch.
          
          Molly stands and extends her hand to Kirk. Kirk stands and
          his boner is impossible to miss. This time he looks down at
          it as if to say, "How 'bout them apples!?" Molly laughs and
          leads him into the bedroom.
          
          Kirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom. He
          lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness
          but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of
          gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out.
          
          Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this.   He
          decides to sit.
          
          Molly opens the door. She is wearing sexy ligerie and
          slippers. She looks perfect. She crosses to the bed and
          sits down next to Kirk. They kiss but Molly stops.
          
          MUSIC REDUCED TO BACKGROUND
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, before we do this, there's
                    something I'm really insecure about
                    and you're going to see it sooner
                    or later so...
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey, take a look at me.
          
          Molly smiles nervously. She stands in front of him, Crying
          Game style. She removes her feet from her slippers and looks
          down at them. Kirk looks down. Even her feet are fantastic.
          
                               KIRK (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                                                                     83.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    Don't rush me... Okay, look.
          
          She parts her toes.    They are webbed.   Kirk's face drops.
          
                                 KIRK
                    That's it?
          
          Kirk jumps up and paces around.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    That's it? That's the best you can
                    do? This is your big flaw?
          
                              MOLLY
                    If you can't handle it...
          
                              KIRK
                    Jesus Christ! I can't! I thought
                    you were going to show me some kind
                    of hairy growth or a third nipple or
                    something I could work with!
          
                              MOLLY
                    What the hell is wrong with you!?
          
                              KIRK
                    You know what's wrong with me!?
                    I'll tell you! I'm fat! I'm bald!
                    I'm ugly! I'm hairy! I'm
                    uncoordinated! I'm uncreative! I'm
                    not a college graduate! I've never
                    been to Europe! I have a shitty
                    job! I drive a shitty car! You
                    want me to go on!? Because I can!
          
                                 MOLLY
                    No.
          
                              KIRK
                    So, here I think that the perfect
                    Molly McCall is finally going to
                    show me a good reason why she's
                    messing around with the likes of
                    me! And this is all you got!? You
                    can't wear friggin' flip-flops!?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, I've given you plenty of good
                    reasons.
          
                                                                    84.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, yeah! I'm nice! I'm funny! I
                    ask cute, stupid questions! Right!
                    That doesn't get a three hooked up
                    with a ten! Not in this world!
          
                              MOLLY
                    A three what?   What are you
                    talking about!?
          
                             KIRK
                    Look! What the hell is going on
                    here!? What are you up to!?
          
                              MOLLY
                    What am I up to!?    Good God!
          
                              KIRK
                    Please, tell me you're a terrorist!
                    Tell me you're on a scavenger hunt!
                    Just tell me something that makes
                    sense because all you're doing is
                    driving me nuts!
          
                              MOLLY
                        (hurt and resigned)
                    The only thing I'm going to tell
                    you is that I'd like you to leave.
          
                              KIRK
                    Fine! I'm going! Webbed feet!?
                    Are you fucking kidding me!?
          
          Kirk grabs his coat and heads out the door.    Molly slumps
          onto her bed and cries as the door slams.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Kirk is at his post looking terribly sad. Stainer is working
          at the same lane and is obviously feeling bad for his friend.
          
          Fuller taps Kirk on the shoulder to alert him that Habib is
          coming through. Habib sees this and takes his bag straight
          to the search table, where he opens it for Kirk. Kirk
          doesn't look inside.
          
                              KIRK
                    Go on, Habib. You're good.
          
                               HABIB
                    Really!?   Great!
          
          Habib steps off to his gate.   Fuller gets in Kirk's face.
          
                                                                 85.
          
          
          
                              FULLER
                    You think you're pretty smart don't
                    you Kettner. Thin ice mister!
          
          Kirk stomps away from the checkpoint.
          
                              FULLER (CONT'D)
                    Good! Don't come back, Kettner!
                    America is safer without you!
          
          Stainer goes after Kirk.
          
          EXT. AIRPORT CURB
          
          Kirk walks out the doors. Stainer catches up to him and they
          walk down the busy curb at a quick, angry pace.
          
                               STAINER
                    Kirky! Hold up, man! What are you
                    doing!? You can't let her screw up
                    your life!
          
                              KIRK
                    Get away from me Stainer!
          
                              STAINER
                    Whoa! Don't take it out on me! We
                    both knew this Molly thing wasn't
                    going to work out! It ain't my
                    fault!
          
                              KIRK
                    You're right. It's not your fault.
                    It's my fault for listening to all
                    your... pernicious advice.
          
                              STAINER
                    What the fuck you talkin' about?
          
                              KIRK
                    All you did was fill my head with
                    all this crap about threes and tens
                    and how I'm not worthy.
          
                              STAINER
                    Are you worthy of a chick like
                    that?
          
                              KIRK
                    Maybe! I don't know. But that's
                    not the point! You're supposed to
                    be my God damned best friend. You
                    know what!?
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                    86.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    I think you were jealous and you
                    set out to sabotage us from the
                    start!
          
                              STAINER
                    That is total bullshit!
          
                              KIRK
                    Then why weren't you there for me?
                    What if she actually liked me!?
                    Maybe with a little help, I could
                    have pulled it off!
          
          Kirk steps onto an...
          
          INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS
          
          Willy (the Russian) is behind the wheel and as happy as ever.
          A few others are seated on the bus. Stainer follows Kirk on
          board. They remain standing, holding onto poles.
          
                              WILLY
                    It is Kirk and his crazy friend
                    Stinker and they are most upset!
          
          Willy steps on it and drives like a maniac, knocking Kirk and
          Stainer around as they argue.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirk, she was going to hurt you.
          
                              KIRK
                    Look at me! I'm hurt now!
          
          Willy occasionally blurts out mindless echoes of their
          argument, which Kirk and Stainer mostly ignore, like...
          
                              WILLY
                    He's hurting now!
          
                              STAINER
                    The longer this went on the worse it
                    would have been. I guarantee it!
          
                              KIRK
                    You don't know what you're talking
                    about.
          
                              WILLY
                    He does not know!
          
                              STAINER
                    Yes, I do, Kirk! I know exactly
                    what I'm talking about.
          
                                                                   87.
          
          
          
                              WILLY
                    Perhaps he does know after all!
          
                              STAINER
                    Remember last year when you hardly
                    saw me for about two months? I met
                    my own perfect ten. Tina Jordan.
                    Smart, cool and hot like you
                    wouldn't believe. Hotter than
                    Molly even.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah right. So how come I never
                    heard a word about her until now?
          
                              WILLY
                    Yes, how come no word of this Tina!?
          
                              STAINER
                    I didn't tell anyone. I didn't
                    want to jinx it. She was perfect.
                    I was spilling over with...with
                    fucking happy! You know?
          
                              WILLY
                    Fucking happy!
          
                              STAINER
                    Two months into it, she dumps me.
                    And I knew it was coming. A girl
                    like that. Sooner or later she was
                    bound to get a better offer. But
                    it kicked my ass, man. I was
                    depressed for months.
          
                              KIRK
                    That's what that was? You said you
                    had that fatigue syndrome thing.
          
                              STAINER
                    I didn't want everyone knowing what
                    a pussy I was. Dude, it was a hurt
                    I can't even put into words.
          
                              WILLY
                    What a pussy.
          
                              STAINER
                    I couldn't watch you go through
                    that 'cause I love you, man.
                    You're the brother I never had.
          
          Stainer leans over and hugs Kirk.   Kirk doesn't hug back.
          
                                                                    88.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    You have a brother, Stainer.
          
                              STAINER
                    Yeah, but he's a cheese-dick.
          
          Kirk's phone rings.    He answers, forcing Stainer to let go.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Hello?
          
          INT. LAW OFFICE
          
          Maury sits at his desk.
          
                              MAURY
                    Kirk? Geeze, I'm glad I caught
                    you. Listen son, I got something
                    to tell you and don't get mad at me
                    okay? 'Cause this thing ain't my
                    fault. You might want to sit down
                    for this.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS
          
          Kirk slumps into a seat and listens, looking upset and
          shocked. Stainer stares at Kirk, trying to get a sense of
          what Kirk is being told.
          
                                 STAINER
                    What!?
          
          INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Patty sits behind a reception desk in a small but stylish
          lobby. A sign above her desk reads, "McCall Events." Kirk
          walks in. Patty puts down her work and stares back at him.
          
                              KIRK
                    Is Molly in?
          
                              PATTY
                    You got some big red apples showing
                    your face around here again.
          
                              KIRK
                    I know. I'm sorry.     I just...   Is
                    she here?
          
                                 PATTY
                    No.     Get lost.
          
          Stainer bursts in sweating and panting.
          
                                                                      89.
          
          
          
                              PATTY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for Christ sake! This one
                    too!?
          
          Patty comes out from behind her desk.
          
                              PATTY (CONT'D)
                    I'm warning you both - Molly has
                    been through enough. You go near
                    her and I will fuck you all the way
                    up! Understand!?
          
          Stainer swaggers up into Patty's face.
          
                              STAINER
                    Listen, bitch...
          
          WHACK!!! Patty throws an elbow and Stainer's head jacks
          back. She is instantly on him, grabbing him in a headlock
          and punching him in the face.
          
                               STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Ahhh!!   Jesus Christ!!! Kirk!!
          
                              PATTY
                    Who's your Mommy!?   Come on!   Who's
                    your Mommy!?
          
                               STAINER
                    You are!
          
                              PATTY
                    That's right! Patty is, isn't she!
          
                              KIRK
                    Patty! Cut it out! I just came to
                    tell her that something happened!
                    Something really major happened!
          
          Patty stops punching and looks up curiously.      Stainer remains
          in the headlock - also curious.
          
                              STAINER
                    What happened?
          
          Patty punches him again.
          
                              PATTY
                    You shut your hole! (to Kirk) What
                    happened?
          
                              KIRK
                    First off, I'm sorry.   Okay?
          
                                                                  90.
          
          
          
          Patty rams Stainer's head into the door.
          
                              PATTY
                    Every time you say you're sorry,
                    dumbshit here gets his bell rung.
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, okay! Sorry!     I just...
          
          Patty slams him again.
          
                               STAINER
                    Dude!   Stop apologizing!
          
                              KIRK
                    Look! I know I was acting like an
                    idiot. She's just so... Well, I
                    was really having a hard time with
                    everyone thinking I was Molly's
                    brother or her co-worker or her gay
                    friend or whatever. I mean, nobody
                    believed that we were together.
          
                              PATTY
                    It's too late for this shit, Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    But I've got it worked out now.
          
          Patty and Stainer wait for it. Kirk decides how to phrase it.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    My Grandmother left me three
                    million dollars.
          
                                 STAINER
                    Seriously?
          
          Patty drops Stainer on the floor.
          
                              PATTY
                    I thought she was a blackjack
                    dealer.
          
                              KIRK
                    It turns out she bought stock in
                    Caesars Palace back in the sixties.
                    Nobody knew she still had it. I
                    don't think she even knew.
          
                              PATTY
                    Wow. So, what does this have to do
                    with Molly?
          
                                                                     91.
          
          
          
                                KIRK
                    See?    Now it makes sense - me with
                    her.    I'm a millionaire now.
          
                              PATTY
                    So, what, now you can afford her!?
          
                              STAINER
                    No! No! I get it! It's not a
                    whore thing! Now it works out in
                    his own mind. Right!? He can
                    relax and stop acting like a freak
                    because now he's bringing something
                    to the table! Right, Kirky!?
          
                              KIRK
                    Right. Well, no. Now that you say
                    it out loud... I don't know.
          
                              PATTY
                    You know what, Kirk - I told Molly
                    you were different but you're just
                    as shallow and full of shit as the
                    rest of them, aren't you?
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, maybe I am.
          
          Kirk walks out.
          
                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Stainer is at his post watching the luggage on the x-ray
          monitor. Suddenly, he sees Kirk coming through followed by
          Marnie, Mr. & Mrs. Kettner, Eric and Debbie (still pregnant).
          They are all wearing bright yellow sweatshirts. Stainer runs
          around the machine to hug Kirk, who looks a little numb.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirky! How you been, brother!?
                    What are you doing here?
          
                              KIRK
                    Me and Marnie and the family are
                    going to Branson. You know.
          
                              STAINER
                    So you're "Branson Bound."
          
          Stainer is referring to Kirk's shirt that reads, "BRANSON
          BOUND" in big letters.
          
                                                                   92.

                    These were Marnie's idea. To make
                    it easy for us to stick together.
          
          The others come through. Their shirts are decorated likewise.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Come on, Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    I gotta go.
          
          Stainer takes the boarding pass from Kirk's hand.
          
                              STAINER
                    Relax, your flight doesn't leave
                    for another forty five minutes.
          
                              KIRK
                        (to Marnie)
                    I'll meet you guys down at the
                    gate, alright?
          
          Marnie isn't pleased but she's going along with it.   Eric
          calls back as they all head to the gate.
          
                              ERIC
                    Hey Stainer! Long time no see!
                    Take care, bro!
          
                              STAINER
                    Why is he so nice all of a sudden?
          
                              KIRK
                    Probably because I'm getting three
                    million dollars next week.
          
                              STAINER
                    Shit, that's right. (THEN) So
                    you're back with Marnie then, huh?
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, I know, but it's for the
                    best. I'm more secure with her.
                    I'm actually happy to be done with
                    all that Molly craziness.
          
          Ron comes through security and over to Kirk.
          
                                                                      93.
          
          
          
                              RON
                    Hey Stainer. Hey Pirate, can you
                    spot me a twenty. I want to get me
                    one of them travel pillows.
          
          Kirk gives Ron a twenty and Ron steps away.    Stainer is
          appalled. He calls after Ron.
          
                              STAINER
                    How come I'm not a pirate!? (then
                    to Kirk) Dude, do not tell me that
                    he's going with you guys.
          
                              KIRK
                    He already bought his ticket and my
                    dad likes him. It's no big deal.
          
                              STAINER
                    Look at me Big Slick.
          
          Kirk doesn't look into his eyes.
          
                              KIRK
                    What?
          
                              STAINER
                    Look at me.
          
          Kirk looks.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Tell me things are good.
          
                              KIRK
                    Don't be such a drama queen.
                    Things are fine. I gotta go.
          
                               STAINER
                    Alright, man. It was good to see
                    you, Kirk.
          
          They exchange an awkward handshake. Kirk walks away.
          Stainer stands alone, watching him go.
          
          Stainer tightens his jaw and runs his fingers through his
          hair. Finally he kicks his head back and, with great
          determination, he stomps off in the opposite direction.
          
          Follow Stainer past security, dodging passengers and carts.
          He arrives at the...
          
                                                                    94.
          
          
          
          INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT
          
          Stainer marches up to the Orange Julius. A short, doughy,
          plain girl works the counter. (This is the same girl that
          Stainer had claimed to have "boned" earlier.) She's wearing
          an orange visor and rubber gloves. Several customers are
          waiting but Stainer moves to stand in front of her.
          
          She looks up from her smoothie.    She has drink powder on her
          face. She groans to see him.
          
                              TINA
                    Elmer, I've got customers here.
          
                              STAINER
                    Tina, I need to know right now why
                    it didn't work out with us.
          
          She hands a smoothie to a customer.
          
                              TINA
                    That's a large Julius.    Twelve
                    fifty.
          
                              STAINER
                    This is important. I was good to
                    you. I was sensitive, right?
          
                              MALE CUSTOMER
                    Hey, Desperado, you gonna order
                    something or what?
          
          Stainer gets in the customer's face.
          
                              STAINER
                    The fuck you just call me!?
          
                               TINA
                    Oh, for Christ's!     Tammy!   Can you
                    cover me!?

          A large crowd of passengers are waiting to board.   The gate
          agent, makes an announcement.
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    Okay folks, we're going to start by
                    boarding the A group. All A's are
                    now welcome to board.
          
          Marnie butts into the line.
          
                                                                 95.

                        (SNOTTY)
                    Look, I've got seven people in my
                    party so we're going to need to
                    board right away.
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    Are you folks in the A group?
          
                              MARNIE
                    What difference does that make!?
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    Well, because you seem like a
                    little bit of a B. May I see your
                    boarding pass?
          
                              MARNIE
                    Fine. We're not in the A group but
                    we're still getting on next.
          
          She hands him the pass - marked "C."
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    Oh, it looks like you're a raging
                    C. So, you're gonna want to take a
                    seat until your group is called.
          
          She stomps away.
          
          INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT - LATER
          
          Stainer and Tina sit at a table. He sits with his head down
          like a sad little boy. She pities him.
          
                              TINA
                    I really liked you Elmer, but all
                    that stuff about me being a ten and
                    how lucky you were and always
                    checking up to see if I was going
                    to dump you...
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, you did dump me, so...
          
                              TINA
                    What could I do? You were all up
                    in my business all the time. I
                    couldn't breathe.
          
                              STAINER
                    It was my stupid job, wasn't it?
                    You were embarrassed.
          
                                                                  96.
          
          
          
                              TINA
                    I work at Orange Julius, Elmer! If
                    you would have just chilled out and
                    been yourself...
          
                              STAINER
                    Okay, I can do that.
          
          She holds up her finger with an engagement ring on it.
          Stainer drops his head onto the table. Tina rubs his hair
          for a second and then walks away.
          
          INT. AIRPLANE - 737 - EVENING
          
          Kirk is somber as he finds his seat near the middle of the
          plane. From two rows back, Eric reaches over some other
          passengers to tap Kirk on the shoulder.
          
                              ERIC
                    Tom fuckin' Wopat, bro!
          
          Eric hangs up a high five and Kirk leaves it hanging. Kirk
          takes a seat on the aisle next to Marnie. He gives Marnie a
          forced smile. She puts her head on his shoulder. Pan over to
          the window seat where Ron sits watching them, wearing his new
          travel pillow.
          
          Suddenly, there is a commotion at the front of the plane.
          
                              FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    What!? You don't have authority on
                    board this aircraft!
          
          Stainer barges past the flight attendant, holding up his TSA
          badge.
          
                              STAINER
                    It's okay folks! TSA! This guy's
                    drunk as fuck and he shit himself.
                    We gotta get him off the plane.
          
          Stainer grabs Kirk by the shoulder, pulls him out of his seat
          and about two rows down the aisle before Kirk overpowers him
          and stops.
          
                               KIRK
                    Stainer!   What are you nuts!?
          
                              STAINER
                    You were right! I messed you up.
                    We gotta fix this thing! Let's go.
          
                                                                   97.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Stainer! No! Believe it or not,
                    this isn't about you! In fact it's
                    none of your business!
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirky! In junior high I peed my
                    pants in class and Eric started
                    calling me Stainer, remember?
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, yeah?
          
                              STAINER
                    Pretty soon everyone else started
                    calling me Stainer because they
                    knew it would make me cry. Then
                    you told me to own that name, to
                    call myself Stainer so nobody could
                    hurt me with it anymore.
          
                              KIRK
                    What's your point?
          
                              STAINER
                    My point is... um... Oh, shit. I
                    was just in the crapper and I had
                    this thing all worked out. Damn it.
          
          The pilot is now behind Stainer and towering over him.
          
                              PILOT
                    Sir, I'm going to have to ask you
                    to exit the aircraft immediately.
          
          Stainer turns into his face.
          
                              STAINER
                    I'm going to have to ask you to
                    fuck off immediately before I feed
                    you your own fuckin' teeth!
          
          The pilot backs up and goes for help.
          
                              KIRK
                    Jesus Stains! You're going to get
                    arrested! And I won't be here to
                    bail you out this time.
          
                              STAINER
                    Ooohh! That was my point! You
                    saved me! That time and a bunch of
                    other times too.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                   98.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    You gotta let me save you this
                    time. It's my turn! Your grandma
                    didn't leave you three million
                    bucks so you could take these a-
                    holes to Branson.
          
          Eric gets up and steps into Stainer's face. In mid-sentence
          and without pausing Stainer zaps Eric with a stun gun. Eric
          sails back into his seat as Stainer continues.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    These people hardly know you.
          
                              KIRK
                    Stainer, I appreciate that you
                    think you're helping me but I'm
                    with Marnie now.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirk, Marnie's a fuckin' bitch.
                    (to Marnie) All due respect.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Hit him Kirk! Or else I will!
          
          Fuller and two other security people enter the plane.   The
          pilot briefs them on what's happening.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirk! You said Marnie makes you feel
                    secure but security is bullshit!
                    Look at our jobs! It's all for show!
                    For all we know, there's a bomb on
                    this plane right now!
          
          The other passengers gasp and most of them look at Habib, who
          sits a few seats behind Kirk.
          
                              HABIB
                    What!?
          
          Fuller grabs Stainer by the collar.
          
                               STAINER
                    You want to see what I think of
                    security!?
          
          Stainer turns and punches Fuller in the face, knocking him
          backwards onto the other agents.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, Stainer, what did you do?
          
                                                                    99.
          
          
          
                                STAINER
                      Kirk! When I added all this up for
                      you I made one big mistake. You
                      are a ten. YOU'RE A TEN, MAN!
          
          Kirk just stares back. Fuller and the agents grab Stainer
          but he clutches a seat and stays put.
          
                                STAINER (CONT'D)
                      You're not buying any of this
                      bullshit are you?
          
                                 KIRK
                      No.
          
          Stainer loses his grip and the agents drag him off the plane.
          Kirk sits down and Marnie comforts him.

          Over a bummed out song we see different areas of the airport.
          People on moving sidewalks. People on escalators. Bags
          moving around on a carousel. People in line. Flight Arrival
          and Departure times. Food trays moving down a buffet. Bags
          moving by on the x-ray monitor. People walking like cattle
          to their gates. Through the crowd, we see a man running
          against the traffic. It's Kirk!
          
          INT. HILTON BALLROOM - NIGHT
          
          Molly,   looking beautiful in a formal gown, moves through a
          sea of   tables. Hundreds of formally dressed people are
          seated   around the tables, eating dinner. Molly greets,
          kisses   and shakes hands with several people as she goes.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT
          
          Kirk is huffing and puffing as he rounds the corner and
          arrives at the checkpoint. He looks around frantically.
          
                                 KIRK
                      Randy!   Where's Stainer!?
          
          Randy points to a room marked, "Airport Security - Authorized
          Personnel Only."
          
          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Kirk bursts in to find Stainer bent over a metal table.
          Fuller (with two black eyes) and another agent hold him down
          as a homeland security agent stands behind Stainer, giving
          him the full cavity search. Kirk doesn't miss a beat.
          
                                                                  100.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                     Stainer! I don't have a car here!
                     I need your van!
          
                                 STAINER
                     Right on!    The keys are in my
                     jacket!
          
          A jacket is hanging by the door. Kirk reaches in and grabs
          the keys. He turns fast and exits. Fuller jacks Stainer's
          head onto the table.
          
                               STAINER (CONT'D)
                     Kirky wait!
          
          The door opens more slowly and Kirk regards his friend with
          great reverence. Stainer strains to lift his head against
          Fuller's strength.
          
                               STAINER (CONT'D)
                     Listen, Kirk. (dramatic pause and
                     music) It's three on the tree and
                     the clutch sticks.
          
          SLAM!   Stainer's head is jacked back onto the table.
          
                               KIRK
                     Thanks buddy!
          
          Kirk bolts.
          
          INT. HILTON - SMALL BANQUET ROOM
          
          This room is set up as a staging area for the cancer benefit.
          Patty and several others are buzzing around preparing for the
          next phase of the evening. Molly enters, holding a walkie
          talkie up to her head and speaking into it.
          
                               MOLLY
                     No, I need the staff ready to help
                     with bids when the auction begins.
                     - over.
          
                               VOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE
                     I don't think we can spare anyone -
                     over.
          
          Patty grabs the walkie talkie.
          
                               PATTY
                     Leslie! We're not here to feed
                     these people, we're here to cure
                     fucking cancer!
                               (MORE)
          
                                                                 101.
          
                              PATTY (CONT'D)
                    Now I want every one of those
                    motherfuckers back there taking
                    bids in fifteen - out!
          
          Patty tosses the walkie-talkie back and then crosses to help
          a group of young cancer patients, some in wheelchairs, to
          unpack their sculptures and label them for the auction.
          
          A stressed-out woman in a BEEHIVE hairdo picks up a SMALL
          BOY's sculpture. She hails Molly.
          
                              BEEHIVE
                    Ms. McCall, we've got a big problem.
          
                              MOLLY
                    What is it?
          
                              BEEHIVE
                    This young man has made an ashtray.
          
                             MOLLY
                    Okay. Well, what do you want from
                    me? Kids make ashtrays.
          
                              BEEHIVE
                    It's a cancer benefit. Don't you
                    think this sends the wrong message?
          
                              SMALL BOY
                    It's a really nice ashtray.
          
                              MOLLY
                    They're not bidding on the artwork;
                    they're bidding on the kids. It's
                    fine.
          
          Beehive sighs hard and hands the ashtray back to the boy.
          
          Molly turns around and a look of surprise comes over her.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing here!?
          
          Reverse to show Talon holding a ridiculously large flower
          arrangement.
          
                              TALON
                    I came to say I'm sorry and to put
                    in a request for a second chance.
          
                              VOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE
                    Ms. McCall, the auction is underway
                    - over.
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    I'm sorry. I have to get in there.
                    Can we talk about this afterwards?
          
                              TALON
                    I'm looking forward to it.
          
          INT. HILTON BALLROOM
          
          The emcee is taking bids on a little sculpture of an abstract
          four-legged animal.
          
                              EMCEE
                    Timothy Brigg's sculpture of a...
                    fire truck? Sold to the woman in
                    the green dress for four hundred
                    fifty dollars. Congratulations
                    ma'am and thanks so much.
          
          Molly picks up the small boy's ashtray and joins the emcee on
          stage. She takes a deep breath before facing the crowd.
          
                              EMCEE (CONT'D)
                    Our next item... Well, here she is
                    folks, the woman who donates her
                    time to make this amazing event
                    possible, our own Molly McCall!
          
          Huge applause.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Thank you. Thanks, Bob. I'm so
                    sorry for my tardiness. The next
                    item up for bids is from nine-year-
                    old Walter Benegan. And this is
                    a... little something that you can
                    put your paper clips or do-dads
                    in... Oh, who am I kidding, it's an
                    ashtray. (audience laughs) Let's
                    start the bidding at one hundred
                    dollars.
          
                              MAN
                    One hundred.
          
                              MOLLY
                    One hundred. Thank you sir.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Two hundred.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Two hundred to the...
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          
                                 MAN 2
                    Two Fifty.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Two seventy five.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Fantastic. Two-seventy-five.     Do I
                    hear three hundred?
          
          No replies. The small boy hangs his head. He was hoping his
          piece would fetch more. His mother pats him on the head.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Two Seventy Five going once.     Going
                    twice.
          
                              KIRK (O.S.)
                    Ten thousand dollars!
          
          The small boy looks up, elated. The spotlight searches the
          room and lands on Kirk near the back. The audience applauds.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk? I hope you don't really
                    think this is going to...
          
                              TALON
                    Eleven thousand!
          
          Talon stands across the room, crossing his arms in defiance.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    What!?
          
          Eric bursts in through a door near Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    Fifteen Thousand!
          
                              TALON
                    Fifteen thousand five hundred!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Both of you! This is ridiculous...
          
                              ERIC
                    Go get him Kirk! It's chump change
                    to you now.
          
                              KIRK
                    Twenty Thousand!
          
                                                                 104.
          
          
          
          The crowd applauds.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Is that a serious bid?
          
                              TALON
                    Fifty thousand dollars!
          
          Bigger applause.
          
                               MOLLY
                    Talon!   Please!
          
          Eric makes a fist to indicate that it's time for the killing
          blow. Kirk nods back his agreement.
          
                              KIRK
                    Three million dollars!
          
          Eric's eyes go wide. This is not what he had in mind. The
          crowd erupts into laughter. Talon also laughs off the bid.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, that's your entire
                    inheritance.
          
          The crowd shifts from laughter into excited chatter.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Folks, calm down. I don't want to
                    get anyone's hopes up. It's only
                    fair that I clarify something to
                    the bidder. Kirk, please
                    understand that if you commit this
                    money, we will all be eternally
                    grateful and I think your
                    grandmother will be very proud of
                    you... But it doesn't change
                    anything between you and me.
          
          This sets off a volley of whispers among the crowd and puts a
          smile on Talon's face.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    So, again, is this a serious bid?
          
          Kirk looks to Molly, then his brother - who is shaking his
          head NO! He then scans the hopeful expressions on the faces
          of the kids and their parents. Kirk takes a deep breath.
          
                              KIRK
                    Three million dollars.
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          
                              ERIC
                    You stupid son of a bitch!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Three million going once. Going
                    twice. Sold to the man in the
                    Branson Bound sweatshirt.
          
          The crowd cheers.
          
                              EMCEE
                    Congratulations to little Walter
                    whose ashtray has brought in more
                    than any piece in our history.
          
          The young sculptor beams. The crowd cheers again. Kirk
          gives a smile and a nod of resignation as he leaves the room.
          
          INT. HILTON BAR
          
          Kirk and Eric sit at the bar, each nursing a drink.   Eric is
          fuming.
          
                              ERIC
                    You are such a numbnut. I am
                    telling you - absolute numbnuttery!
          
                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.     May I use that ashtray?
          
          Kirk turns to find that he is sitting next to BILLY JOEL, who
          is smoking a cigar. Eric passes him the ashtray that Kirk
          just bought.
          
                              ERIC
                    Sure. Careful with it there,
                    Captain Jack. It cost him three
                    million bucks.
          
          Billy Joel, ashes in the ashtray.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Yeah, I saw that. Tough break in
                    there, my friend. Still, that was
                    a hell of a good thing you did for
                    those kids.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Thanks.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Beautiful women huh? What are you
                    gonna do?
          
                                                                 106.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    I guess I'm going to go home.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    It's none of my business but I do
                    know a thing or two about hooking
                    up with women who are out of your
                    league. Can I tell you a little
                    secret?
          
          Kirk and Eric look at one another in disbelief and then at
          Joel.
          
                               KIRK
                    Sure.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Look, it's not about money, fame or
                    power...
          
                              ERIC
                    Whoa! All due respect there, Big
                    Shot. How would you know? You had
                    all that shit when you bagged the
                    big ones.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Yeah, but I had all that shit when
                    I lost 'em too. It's not enough.
          
                              ERIC
                    You believe this fuckin' guy?
          
                              KIRK
                    Jesus Christ, Eric! I'm trying to
                    get some advice from Billy Joel.
                    Do you think you could manage to
                    shut the fuck up for two minutes!?
          
                               ERIC
                    Fine.   Geeze. What's up your ass?
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Thank you. Look kid, it's not what
                    you can give 'em or even what you
                    can give up. It's what your made
                    of.
          
          Joel places a cocktail in front of Kirk and then clinks his
          own against it.
          
                                                                  107.
          
          
          
          INT. HILTON BALLROOM - LATER
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Ladies and gentlemen, please
                    welcome The Piano Man! The
                    Entertainer! And our foundation's
                    greatest champion! Mr. Billy Joel!
          
          The crowd cheers as the curtain rises.   The crowd's
          excitement turns to confusion.
          
          From the back of the room, Molly notices the crowd's
          reaction. She turns to see Kirk seated before the huge white
          grand piano, his hands sweaty and shaking over the keys.
          
          Kirk looks at the crowd.   Hundreds of confused faces stare
          back at him.
          
          Beehive rushes Patty in a panic.
          
                              BEEHIVE
                    Aren't you going to do something
                    about this!?
          
                              PATTY
                    Lady, he just gave three million
                    dollars. He can go up there and
                    try to blow himself for all I care.
          
          Kirk wrings his hands as they shake harder.
          
          Billy Joel stands in the wings and gives Kirk a nod of, "You
          can do it."
          
          Molly turns to walk away but notes ring out from the piano
          and she stops.
          
          Kirk plays and sings "Just the Way You Are" - badly. His
          voice and hands shake but he forges on. The audience is
          confused, cringing and restless.
          
          Someone starts booing.   Kirk can't help but glance up to see
          who it is - it's Eric.
          
          When Kirk reaches the instrumental break, he settles in a bit
          - he can actually play.
          
          As the last note fades, Kirk leaps up, and runs out into
          the...
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          
          EXT. HILTON BACK ALLEY
          
          Kirk bursts out the door and vomits into a dumpster. He
          falls backwards against the wall and slides down into a
          sitting position.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    You realize that there's a good
                    chance this won't work out.
          
          Molly steps out into the alley.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    And you could get hurt.
          
                                KIRK
                    I know.
          
                              MOLLY
                    And you're going to have to be
                    naked in front of me at some point.
          
                              KIRK
                    I can work up to that.
          
          Kirk stands up.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    So, you and me are...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Three million dollars for kids with
                    cancer and you sing to me? I'm not
                    made of wood you know.
          
          Molly hugs him. The first intro riff of a piano version of
          "Pressure" kicks in and the crowd inside goes crazy.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    But one condition.
          
                                KIRK
                    Anything.
          
                               MOLLY
                    You have to go brush your teeth
                    right now.
          
          Talon walks out into the alley, still holding the flowers.
          
                              TALON
                    So, Molly... Can we finish our
                    conversation?
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
          
          Kirk takes Molly's hand and leads her past Talon.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry Poncho, she's with me.
          
                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. WEDDING - DAY
          
          Close on a preacher.
          
                              PREACHER
                    The vows you have just heard are a
                    unique expression of the love
                    between two souls.
          
          Close on Kirk - looking dapper but sweaty and nervous.
          
                              PREACHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Two souls who have come together
                    this day in holy matrimony.
          
          Close on Molly - looking more beautiful than ever.
          
                              PREACHER (CONT'D)
                    And by the power vested in me by
                    the great state of Nevada, I now
                    pronounce you husband and wife.
                    You may now...
          
          A wider shot reveals the NASCAR theme wedding of Eric and
          Debbie. Kirk stands among the groomsmen. Each are dressed
          in tuxes that represent the colors, numbers and sponsors of
          certain drivers. Molly stands among the bridesmaids. Each
          dressed in a checkered-flag gown. Ron and Marnie are also in
          the wedding party.
          
          Debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and
          Eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss. Debbie
          grabs Eric's ass while Eric gropes her breasts.
          
          Stainer and Wheel in the Sky kick into "Any Way You Want It"
          from a bandstand nearby. Patty dances in front of Stainer -
          he winks back at her.
          
          Devon cuts up a wedding cake that looks like a full-sized
          racing wheel and tire.
          
          EXT. WEDDING - STREET
          
          The guests throw rice as Eric and Debbie run to a stretch
          Nascar limo.
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
          Eric picks up Debbie and loads her in through the window.   He
          then runs around to the other side and jumps into that
          window. The limo burns rubber as it peels away.
          
          Pan across the guests as they wave goodbye; Devon and his
          squeaky clean family, Jack and a hot date, Mr. & Mrs.
          Kettner, Marnie & Ron. Patty and Stainer - making out. Kirk
          and Molly stand together arm in arm. Kirk holds a ceramic
          urn, painted with the Las Vegas skyline.
          
          Push in on the urn until the skyline becomes real. Push in
          toward the top of The Stratosphere Casino. Continue pushing
          in until we are inside the observation deck. Push through
          the gift shop where the TV is tuned to CNN. As we pass the
          TV we hear.
          
                              CNN ANCHOR
                    In a press conference held earlier
                    today, NASA officials announced
                    that affordable tourist travel to
                    the surface of the moon will be a
                    reality within the next ten to
                    fifteen years.
          
          Push past the TV, out of the gift shop and to the other side
          of the observation deck where we find Kirk and Molly. They
          kiss before they open the urn and pour Grammy's ashes over
          the side.

INT. LAUNDROMAT, MOCKINGBURG, NEW YORK - NIGHT

Glaring fluorescence, trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes,
empty Coke machine flashing all lights orange. Only two dryers are
humming. It's very late. Keep PANNING to...

...a wiry, gimlet-eyed WOMAN, furtively removing crumpled
newspapers from a dryer. She flattens and folds them meticulously,
her glance darting angrily everywhere. Top secret mission.

...a natty little black man. PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper on
a neat cloth atop a dryer. Small cold fowl. Brie, baguette,
olives. Bottle of red. An air of competence, of indomitable
upbeatness. He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were
normal. More curious about...

...a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if
cramming for life's midterm exam. Thoughtful. Circles one,
slowly. Set out on QUOYLE's dryer are one Snickers bar and four
empty snickers wrappers. His version of cold supper. He reaches
for the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he...

...rises. Goes to the candy machine. Drops in his 65 cents, hits
the button. The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in the
mechanism at the last moment. Quoyle blinks dully. One more
retelling of the story of his life. He BANGS the machine half-
heartedly. Nope. Shakes it with his shambling strength. Nada.
POUNDS the coin return button. Hat trick. He empties his pocket.
Studies the results. Not enough. And without so much as a sigh...

...he ambles back to his dryer. Starts to unwrap the last
Snickers. Partridge taking this all in. But Mata Hari of the
Neat Newspapers goes to the candy machine, KICKS it violently. Out
fall the Snickers and the 65 cents. She scoops up both, turns in a
single motion to...

...GLARE death at the enemy. Quoyle opens his mouth to comment.
But. Doesn't. Resumes unwrapping his supper, as...

...his dryer STOPS. He pops it open. Stares in. Blinks.
Suddenly YANKS a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor
to reveal they have been...

...STAINED streaky BLUE by a cheap pen, quietly melting amid the
pile. This slips beneath even Quoyle's expectation level. The
big, soft face is pitifully, yes, even adorably, devastated.

                             QUOYLE (a murmur)
                Ruined.

And to the bystander.     This seems a comment on more than shirts.

                          PARTRIDGE (softly)
                Nah. Rub the ink with hot salt and
                talcum powder.

Quoyle's head WHIPS around.     As if he thought he was alone.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                If you're shocked when someone aims
                kindness your way. That oughta tell
                you somethin' about yourself.

Watches the little guy's undemanding smile.

                          QUOYLE (V.O., just staring)
                Then again. If you're that kinda
                guy. It don't.

                          PARTRIDGE
                And put a cuppa bleach in, next
                time through.

As Quoyle gazes at his benefactor, the woman sneaks up, SNATCHES
his Help Wanted ads. Races them over to her dryer. As the boys
watch, she shoves them in, starts the machine with Quoyle's coins,
and glares fiercely back at us. A mother bear protecting her cubs.
Partridge chuckles. Holds out his hand...

                             PARTRIDGE
                Partridge.

Quoyle glances at the little man's cold fowl supper.

                           QUOYLE
                Uh.   No thanks.

                          PARTRIDGE
                It's my name.

Oh.

INT. MOCKINGBURG RECORD CITY ROOM - DAY

Shabby one-floor newspaper. Old equipment, listless personnel,
stale you can smell from here. Only guy working is Partridge, who
is laying out the front page, and glances up to see across the
floor...

...Quoyle enter in his best suit. It is also his worst suit.
Partridge points to the only enclosed office, and gives his buddy a
hearty thumbs-up. Quoyle nods, his smile a rictus, his eyes a
glaze of panic. We see now that he is chewing, somehow. On the
way into the office, he snags a doughnut from a paper plate by the
coffee. Enters...

INT. ED PUNCH'S OFFICE - DAY

...ED PUNCH, managing editor, looks up from a reverie with a
startled expression. He wears really thick glasses which MAGNIFY
his eyes, giving him a frightening aspect.

                             PUNCH

                 Quoyle?     You're early.

From the rear, we see Quoyle can barely squeeze himself into the
chair.

                           PUNCH
                 I don't like that.

All the change SPILLS out of Quoyle's pockets, and CLATTERS onto
the wood floor, ROLLING interminably, as Quoyle fidgets.

                           PUNCH
                 Partridge says you're not as
                 dumb as you look.

REVERSE ANGLE now to see Quoyle's face.        The neat moustache of
powdered sugar.

                           QUOYLE (V.O.)
                 How could I be?

And takes a healthy bite from what's left of the doughnut.

                           PUNCH
                 Anyway, that's why I'm takin' a chance
                 on you. Partridge said he'd re-write
                 whatever of your stuff. Stay late...

Quoyle nods, dumbly.     Knows this.

                           PUNCH
                 We're a family paper. Upbeat
                 stories with a community slant.
                 Self-help stuff: Are You a Break-
                 fast Alcoholic?...Guide to Getting
                 Dumped...like that.

Quoyle nods bigger. Like he gets it.         Punch shoves an antique tape
recorder across the table.

                           PUNCH
                 City Planning Board meeting at two-
                 thirty. Three hunnerd words max.
                 Sink or swim.

HOLD on Quoyle's eyes.      Recalling...

FLASHBACK:   EXT. PUBLIC POOL - DAY

...Quoyle as a fat kid in a baggy bathing suit, being savagely
pummeled by his vicious OLDER BROTHER...

                           QUOYLE (V.O.)
                 I think my brother said that once.

                              BROTHER
                 LARDASS!     SNOTFACE!    FARTBAG!

Being pulled off the sniveling Quoyle by a rough hairy man with
dead eyes.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                Maybe it was my father.

Quoyle's FATHER hauls him off the deck, and in a single motion,
FLINGS him INTO the pool!

                          FATHER
                Sink or swim, pig-butt.

Watches the THRASHING with mild contempt.     Turns away before Quoyle
simply SINKS beneath the surface.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                I'm not a water person.

INT. CITY ROOM - LATE NIGHT

The empty room a haven of dust motes floating in sickly fluor-
escence. Quoyle sits across the desk, gazing with endearing
fearfulness as Partridge turns page after page...

                          PARTRIDGE
                See, three hunnerd words would be,
                like, one page. This is...oh,
                fifteen, sixteen.

                          QUOYLE
                So we should cut it.

Partridge does glance up on that.

                          PARTRIDGE
                Gonna have to.

                          QUOYLE
                Or you could tie me in a sack, throw
                me in the river. Tell the police you
                thought it was oddly-wrapped lard.

                          PARTRIDGE
                Might be quicker.

Nobody smiles. Nobody has to. Quoyle pulls a big glass jar from a
paper sack. Sets it on the desk.

                          QUOYLE
                Does your wife like special pickles?
                They're fine with cold cuts.

Partridge looks at the cornichons.     They look expensive.

                          PARTRIDGE
                Come by for supper, tomorrow.     We'll

                   find out.

DISSOLVE to...

EXT. PARTRIDGE'S BACK YARD - DAY

Sausages on the BBQ, interesting colors and sizes. A huge hand
delicately places cut-up pieces of quail on the grill. It is
Quoyle, trusted, paying attention. MERCALIA, a slim black woman
with fiery eyes and an enticing smile, hands him a glass of white
wine, and...

...goes to slip her arm around Partridge. He watches Quoyle's
concentration approvingly. Shares a smile with his sexy wife.       And
raps a knife on his glass. Announcement.

Quoyle looks up with innocent eyes.         Which makes Partridge
hesitate.

                                PARTRIDGE
                   We.     Got you this.

Mercalia takes out the package. Wrapped in tissue, a neat ribbon.
She hands it to Quoyle, and leans up to kiss his cheek. Quoyle
looks down at it, dumbfounded. A silence.

                             MERCALIA
                   It's...an anniversary present.
                   Anniversary of our friendship.

Quoyle smiles.     Sweet and slightly confused.

                             QUOYLE
                   Seven and a half month anniversary?

He starts to unwrap...

                                PARTRIDGE
                   Well.     Why wait?

...a wristwatch.     A nice one.     He is overwhelmed, but still
uncomprehending.

                              MERCALIA
                   It's because we're happy.      About
                   something.

And steals a glance at her husband.

                             QUOYLE (BIG grin)
                   You're havin' a baby!

That stops Partridge's face.        No more stalling...

                             PARTRIDGE
                   Mercalia and me are movin'.
                   To California. Friday night.

Quoyle so pole-axed he can't even lose the smile.    It just turns
stupid and transparent. His friend swallows.

                          PARTRIDGE
                You know she's been learnin' to
                drive a rig. She got the Oakland
                to New Orleans run. I'm gonna
                make her smoked duck sandwiches for
                the road. I can edit copy anywhere.

Quoyle nodding slowly, smile still there. Yep. I guess y'can.
Partridge sees that it's a death blow. Mercalia looks at her feet.

                          PARTRIDGE
                Love's all that counts.   It's the
                engine of life.

As if parting advice. As if Quoyle should file that away.      So
Quoyle nods some more. As if he will.

                          PARTRIDGE
                We'll just. Stay in touch.

On this, Quoyle's smile deserts him. So Partridge reaches out his
hand. Quoyle paralyzed, then takes it. CLOSE ON their handclasp,
and DISSOLVE to...

INT. DOUBLETREE MEETING ROOM - EVENING

...a slender feminine hand.   Buried in Quoyle's.

                          PETAL (O.S.)
                Petal Bear, Mr. Quoyle.

PAN up to see her. Tiny, twitchy, moist ringlets. A gray-eyed
predator. She looks around at the milling suits and their name
tags. As if they were alternatives.

                          PETAL
                Do you hate this shit, or what?

Quoyle transfixed by her slight form in its loose but clingy
wrapping. The smile that sees him again and flickers...

                          PETAL
                What do you think? You want to
                marry me, don't you?

Don't you? No answer. She laughs, as if at some off-color
response. Runs hot fingers up his arm, leaning to his face...

                          PETAL
                Buy me a drink somewhere, it's
                seven-thirty. I think I'm going
                to fuck you by ten. What do you
                think of that?

Quoyle.   Blinks.     She laughs again.   Bright, like whiskey music.

                              PETAL
                    You are quite. The raconteur.

INT. QUOYLE'S TRAILER - LATE NIGHT

Petal naked in near-darkness, moves with authority toward the
massive lumpy creature nearly overflowing his bed. Draws the
covers back.

Stares.

                               PETAL
                    Christ.   I won the lottery.

Climbs on, the lithe move of a leopardess.         Feeding time.

                              QUOYLE (V.O.)
                    It was pretty much like that for
                    a month.

Petal RIDING in silhouette, with great, violent swoops.            CLOSE on
his face, his eyes. Lovelight.

                              QUOYLE (V.O.)
                    Somewhere in there. We got married.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Horrible place. Smoke and bodies. Quoyle alone, carrying his
sloshing beer, apologies unheard, toward...

                              QUOYLE (V.O.)
                    After that, I had to follow her to
                    see her.

...the back of Petal, talking to a big guy in a shiny suit.

                              QUOYLE (V.O.)
                    Which I know was wrong of me.

Closer.   Close enough to hear...

                              PETAL
                    What do you think? You want to
                    marry me, don't you?

HOLD on Quoyle's face. The lovelight has never left.          It shines
through the shock. As if in apology...

                              QUOYLE (V.O.)
                    She didn't know she was pregnant.

DISSOLVE to...

INT. PARLOR - DAY

One-year-old BUNNY is SCREAMING in a rickety crib festooned with
mobiles and bright toys. HEAR Quoyle POUNDING in. He reaches to
lift her...

...WAY UP, starts running around the faded little parlor making
cheerful airplane noises, as he DIVES and SWOOPS the shrieking kid,
until he...

...stops. Sniffs. Oh. Gives her a kiss, which doesn't put a dent
in the screaming, and flops her down on the diaper table. She is
screaming LOUDER. He is fumbling with the diaper, the Baby Wipes,
getting a wad of ten or so at once. When...

...the phone rings. He runs off. Runs back, lifts Bunny, diaper
dangling from the tape stuck to her skin, and SNATCHES up the
phone, hoping with everything in him that it's...

                          PETAL (O.S.)
                 Hey. How do you make an Alabama
                 Slammer?

He takes a breath.     Can hear the noise of a rowdy spot.     Country
juke box.

                             QUOYLE
                 Uh.    Where are y...

                              PETAL (O.S.)
                 Alabama.     Hence, the question.

Bunny.   Has stopped screaming.

                              QUOYLE
                 Come home.     I'll make you one.

                           PETAL (O.S.)
                 That's a swell idea. Now go look on
                 top of the fridge, where I keep the
                 Mr. Boston. I'll wait.

What should he do? He sets Bunny carefully on the floor. She
starts screaming again, and he LIFTS her quick, cuddles her. LOPES
off, leaving the phone on the floor...

...RACES back in with the Mr. Boston, a bag of pork rinds, and
a pacifier. Something for everyone. As he flips the pages, he
murmurs into the phone...

                              QUOYLE
                 You okay?     Except for being thirsty?

She laughs, almost friendly.      He smiles.   Ever hopeful.

                           PETAL (O.S.)
                 I'm busy, I'll see y...

                             QUOYLE (reads)
                   Ounce Southern Comfort, ounce Sloe
                   Gin. Ounce Triple Sec. Three ounces
                   o.j....

                               PETAL (O.S.)
                   Got it.

CLICK. The BUZZ of her disconnect. He glances down at Bunny,
working the pacifier. Murmurs to the receiver...

                               QUOYLE
                   Me too.    I'll tell Bunny you miss her.

Hang up the phone. Kiss a baby. Eat a pork rind. Slow. As he
gazes down on Bunny, we PUSH INTO her face, and MATCH DISSOLVE
to...

INT. BUNNY'S ROOM - NIGHT, FIVE YEARS LATER

...an ECU of Bunny, now six years old, asleep in the flickering
blue light of a nearly-mute TV. Apparently she was watching
Sportscenter. PAN the darkened shoebox room. Toys everywhere, in
a clutter. A pile of used Barbies, limbs jutting in all
directions, waiting for a mass grave. BACK to Bunny, to see...

...she sleeps in her father's lap. His chin resting on her head,
an industrial-size bag of cookies handy. Somewhere, a door OPENS..

...SLAMS HARD. Quoyle gently lays Bunny on her bed, and lurches
INTO the hall, to see Petal disappearing into her bedroom, and he
hurries to stop the door before it slams in his face.

When she turns, she is wasted, feral, and somehow as sexy as ever.
Her laser glare. What the fuck do you want?

                               QUOYLE
                   There's.    Cold chicken.

Really? She tears off her jacket, revealing that she has left her
shirt somewhere and is down to her bra. She stalks toward him.
Straight to the doorway. He flinches.

                             PETAL
                   Find yourself. A girlfriend.
                   With what you got down there,
                   you'll do fine.

Quoyle swallows.     Shakes his head.

                             PETAL
                   Only thing can work, here.    Is
                   divorce.

No.   No.   Tears of shock pool in his eyes.

                           QUOYLE (V.O.)
                 I knew we had our problems. But
                 I never thought I'd hear that word.

She shivers with disgust. Walks around in a frustrated circle.
Back to his face. Are you sure? What does a girl have to do? And
now...

...the tears are on his face.     She flashes her hardest look.      And
yet...

...her slender fingers reach out.     Wipe his face, not as roughly as
she might have intended.

                           PETAL
                 Your funeral, pussy.

And CLOSES the door, quietly, but firmly.      In his face.

He stares at it. His lips part. But no sound comes.           Instead, he
walks the few steps to Bunny's room, to find her...

...wide awake.   Sitting on the edge of her bed.     No question, she
heard it all.

So Quoyle smiles. He reaches to the top of her battered armoire.
His eyes damp but dancing for his daughter. Pulls down...

...a box of chocolates. Their stash.       He sits on the floor.     Opens
the lid, like buried treasure.

She comes to cuddle in his lap.     He feeds her one.   She feeds him
one. They've done this before.      As they chew...

                           QUOYLE (V.O.)
                 I knew if I could take it. In the
                 end. It would all work out.

INT. CITY ROOM - MIDDAY

Everyone trooping back from lunch, twos and threes. Quoyle last,
alone, still stuffing down a snack cake as he heads for the coffee
pot. There's one answering machine for everybody here, glowing a
red number 2. Someone hits it, and everybody shuts up a beat, to
see if they got lucky.

                           MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                 Lila, it's Daniel. Ten-thirty.
                 Bring the. You know.

LILA doesn't even bother to blush.      A shrug is plenty.

                           FATHER (O.S.)
                 Quoyle, this is your father. Calling
                 you. Dicky's machine is full. Your
                 home one's broke. Well. It's time
                 for your mother and I to go.

Quoyle listening.      Go?

                              FATHER (O.S.)
                    Instructions about the undertaker.
                    The cremation. On the dining room
                    table.

Oh.     Go.   Eyes are sneaking over now.   Lots of them.

                              FATHER (O.S.)
                    You'll have to make your own way.
                    I did. Nobody gave me nuthin'.
                    Other men woulda give up, turned to
                    bums. I sweated, wheeled barrows of
                    sand, went without so you and yer
                    brother could have advantages. Not
                    that you did much with your chances.

Everybody just openly staring now.       Quoyle's snack cake and coffee
frozen in mid-air.

                              FATHER (O.S.)
                    Hasn't been much of a life. Tell
                    Dicky and my sister Agnis Hamm.
                    Her number's on the dining room ta...

BEEP!

                              MACHINE (O.S.)
                    That was your final message.

Quoyle nods. Sounded that way. Despite the hateful coarseness of
this message, Quoyle is deeply moved. Lips pursed inward to stem
tears. In the silence...

                              FAT GUY (trying)
                    Were they sick, or something?

Quoyle stares into distance.       Somewhere, feet shuffle.

                              QUOYLE
                    Brain tumor and liver cancer.
                            (afterthought)
                    One apiece.

                              FAT GAL (sad for him)
                    That's rough.

He nods, it is that. Wanders       on over to his desk. They're still
watching, but he doesn't seem      to notice. Turns his ratty Rolodex
with solemn slowness. Not to       dishonor the moment. Finds the
number, dials. Winces at the       harshness of the voice he hears.
Then...

                               QUOYLE
                    Dicky.   It's Mom and Poppa.    They.

He can't say any more.     Turns out, he doesn't need to.

                          BROTHER (O.S., snorts)
                Jeez, they did it? I never
                thought he'd find the fucking guts.

Quoyle licks his lips.     His eyes puddling now.

                             QUOYLE
                So.     For the funeral, I thou...

                          BROTHER (O.S.)
                You think I'd go pay that prick
                respects? You got me confused
                with you!

Quoyle shakes his head once.     That confused he isn't.

                             QUOYLE (quietly)
                Well.     Mom'll be there, too.

Silence.

                          BROTHER (O.S.)
                Hey, Barfbag. They leave us
                anything, y'think?

                          QUOYLE
                Don't see how. Big mortgage.
                Spent their savings on the doctors.
                I hadda send some grocery mon...

                          BROTHER (O.S.)
                Well, see, that's why he did it.
                I mean, think how it felt. Taking
                from you.

LONG ANGLE...they are watching him replace the receiver in its
cradle. Think. Stumble slightly, as he makes his way toward...

INT. PUNCH'S OFFICE - DAY

Punch looks up, startled at Quoyle's entrance. His oversized
glasses seem to magnify his eyes more than ever.

                          QUOYLE
                Sorry, Ed. I gotta drive down to my
                parents' place. I'll be back, Friday.

A full beat.

                          PUNCH
                Take yer time. I gotta let you go.

Quoyle's eyes sharpen.

                           QUOYLE
                 In what sense do you m...

                           PUNCH
                 As in canned.

Oh.   Once again, life slips beneath even Quoyle's expectations.

                            QUOYLE (a little dazed)
                 Uh.   Would next week be better?

                           PUNCH (sighs)
                 I got the summer interns comin' next
                 week. They're free and they're smart.
                 Gotta do somethin' to fight this
                 slump. But don't worry...

Don't?

                           PUNCH
                 Yer not the only one.
                           (beat)
                 Eventually.

A beat.

                           QUOYLE
                 Should I finish the sawmill piece?

INT. QUOYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

Quoyle enters carrying a spray of violets.     HEAR Springer turned up
loud. He goes to the parlor to find...

...MRS. MOOSUP, the babysitter, smoking and swigging a Pepsi. She
is mean-ugly with flesh hanging beneath her arms. She stares at
him, the flowers.

                           MRS. MOOSUP (dry)
                 Mr. Quoyle. You shouldn't have.

                           QUOYLE (taking her literally)
                 They're for Petal, Mrs. Moosup.
                 I got something to tell her.

                           MRS. MOOSUP
                 Well, that may take awhile.

Uh-oh.

                           MRS. MOOSUP
                 She came in at one, packed like
                 crazy. Said she was movin' to
                 Florida with the guy in the red Geo.
                 You know the one.

He knows the one.

                            MRS. MOOSUP
                  She says you gotta pay my wages for
                  the sittin'. Seven weeks, comes to
                  $3080. 'Preciate a check right n...

He is heading toward the hall.

                            MRS. MOOSUP
                  Don't bother. She took Bunny
                  with her.

That stops him.    Cold.     He turns...

                            QUOYLE
                  That's the last thing she'd ev...

                            MRS. MOOSUP
                  She was real clear about my check.
                  It's no fun workin' if you don't
                  get paid.

He TEARS out, DOWN the hall, INTO Bunny's room...

...closet open. Empty. No more tangled pile of Barbies.                He
surveys the wreckage of his life.

                            QUOYLE (V.O.)
                  At least she took her toys.       Wanted
                  her to be happy.

He staggers out of the room, down the hall...

                            MRS. MOOSUP (O.S.)
                  Mr. Quoyle? I ain't got all day, here!

...into the kitchen.       Lifts the receiver.    Thinks.     Dials.

                               QUOYLE (quietly)
                  Yes.     I need to report a kidnapping.

And straightens his spine.       Just a little.

                           QUOYLE
                  Quoyle. Q-U-O-Y-L-...no, Y, then
                  L-E. Yeh, it's my kid.

He's still holding the violets.         He notices this.     Sets them down,
almost tenderly, in the sink.

INT. QUOYLE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Quoyle alone in absolute darkness. Bumping around the house.
There's a large bag of something in one hand, maybe M & Ms. But
he's not eating. Just murmuring to himself...

                               QUOYLE

                 Who knows?     Who knows?

INT. QUOYLE'S PARENTS' HOME, BROOKLYN - DAY

Quoyle moving in his parents' cluttered parlor like a man
underwater. A room as drab, as neglected, as Brooklyn through
the window. He stands at a shelf now, staring at a row of framed
photos. Lifts one...

...a BOY of 15, bundled for winter, stands by a frozen pond.
Stocky, sullen, something unpleasant in the narrow eyes. Next
to him, not touching, a GIRL, big for 12. Rawboned, husky. Flat
gaze, like something's dead or hidden.

Quoyle walks to the table. A cardboard box has been filled with
mementos. A slip of paper: AGNIS HAMM, a telephone number. The
phone is RINGING now. Quoyle staring at the paper. Finally, lifts
the phone, breathes an absent greeting, and...

                           MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                 Is this Mr. Guy Quoyle?

                           QUOYLE (weary)
                 He's not here.

                           MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                 This is Lt. Amos Figg of the
                 Mockingburg, New York Police. Could
                 you have him call me when he ret...

                           QUOYLE
                 He's passed on. He's dead.
                           (beat)
                 You said Mockingb...

                           FIGG (O.S.)
                 We're a small town upstate. I'm
                 actually trying to reach his son.
                 He allegedly went down to his
                 parents' place two days ago.

Quoyle blinks.   Not in the mood.

                           QUOYLE
                 Are you a detective, Lieutenant?

                              FIGG (O.S.)
                 Yes sir.

                           QUOYLE
                 Well, as you've probably deduced, I
                 am his son. Cause I'm at his
                 place. As alleged.

Silence.

                              FIGG (O.S.)

                  There's no need for that tone,
                  sir. I'm calling with urgent news.

And says no more.     We can feel Quoyle's heart beating from here.

                            QUOYLE
                  Which is...?

                            FIGG (O.S., hesitant)
                  You want the good news? Or
                  the bad news.

Ominous.   Would be an understatement.

                               QUOYLE
                  The good.     Please.

                             FIGG (O.S.)
                  Your daughter Bunny was sold by
                  your wife to a child pornographer.
                  For $9000.

Quoyle's heart.     Has stopped.

                            FIGG (O.S.)
                  But she's fine. We got her. And
                  the doc says she wasn't touched.
                  Yet. If you catch my drift.

INTERCUT...a dingy kitchen, scuzzier than we could even have
guessed. Bunny in her underpants sliding merrily on a floor made
slippery with dish detergent. PAN past the video camera on its
tripod to the PORNOGRAPHER at the window, also in his underpants,
screaming into a cordless phone. And...

BACK to Quoyle.     His heart must have started again, because he is
able to say...

                               QUOYLE
                  That's.     The good n...

                               FIGG (O.S.)
                  Well.     Compared.

INTERCUT...a riverbank somewhere high above swiftly-flowing water.
Police and bystanders gathered. A winch reaching its chain into
the depths.

                            FIGG (O.S.)
                  Your wife was in a red Geo which
                  went through a guardrail over the
                  Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

Here comes part of the Geo.        Streaming water and mud.

                            FIGG (O.S.)
                  They were doin' 97 in a fog.      The

                car was cut in half by the impact
                with the rail. Her male companion's
                body floated up downstream.

BACK to the horrified husband.     Waiting in silence.

                          QUOYLE
                And Petal...?

                          FIGG (O.S.)
                May never find the body. But she
                was mercifully killed on impact,
                without a doubt. They found her
                shoes under the dash and her...
                trousers for some reas...

                          QUOYLE
                That don't mean for sure she w...

                          FIGG (O.S.)
                ...and her purse. With the nine
                large.

Oh. Tears finally force their way through the shock.      As he
realizes...

                          QUOYLE (a murmur)
                Yeh. If she was alive. Don't
                guess she'd a left that.

INT. COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES - DAY

Quoyle moving his bulk FAST down a corridor, a uniformed COP almost
skipping alongside to keep up, watching Quoyle like a hawk all the
way to....

...the threadbare common room. Kids playing, arguing, sleeping,
staring at an antique TV. Quoyle goes THROUGH them all, cop
doggedly in his wake, and sinks to his knees beside...

                          BUNNY
                I can't do this.

Bunny on the ratty sofa, legs dangling, holding out a vintage
Gameboy. She wears clean clothes, freshly-washed hair, and a
comfortable smile.

                          QUOYLE (very soft)
                Me neither.

And kisses her, lightly, on the lips.

                          QUOYLE (softer still)
                Hi.

She kisses him back, much harder, on the mouth.     The lopsided grin
of a practicing imp.

                              BUNNY
                 Hi, too.     That for me?

We hadn't seen them, hidden beside his leg.          A bunch of DAISIES.
He gives them to her. Like her best beau.

                           BUNNY
                 Where's our candy?

                           QUOYLE
                 In the store. That way, you've
                 got the whole selection.

And then...

                           QUOYLE
                 Give us a minute.

Bunny doesn't understand.

                           QUOYLE
                 I mean him.

PULL BACK to the cop, staring down on them from point-blank range.
He doesn't move. Quoyle looks up, with an easy smile that says
he'd just as soon tear all the arms and legs off, and sweat the
consequences later. The cop backs well off. He can take a hint.

                            BUNNY
                 Petal went to Florida.       She'll be
                 back soon.

He looks in her eyes.      Shakes his head.    No.

                           QUOYLE
                 She had an accident.

                              BUNNY
                 So do you.

He nods, I do.   Tenderly pulls a strand of her hair aside.

                           QUOYLE
                 There was a car crash, sweetie.
                 And they found...you know, the
                 body. Of her friend.

                              BUNNY
                 Nestor.

That's right. His big hand has wrapped around one of hers.           She
doesn't seem to mind. Their faces so close.

                           QUOYLE
                 Petal can't come back, she's dead.
                 You know dead. Like the turtle.

She drills his eyes.   Calm as a moose.

                           BUNNY
                 We found the turtle. And they
                 found Nestor. Did you find Petal?

He shakes his head.

                           BUNNY
                 You never do. But she always
                 comes back.

And leans her forehead.      To rest against his.

                           BUNNY
                 Don't worry.

INT. QUOYLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Quoyle stumbling toward the front door, drawing his robe around
him. Squinting through the peephole. OPENING the door, to
reveal...

                           AGNIS
                 Nephew, I'm your Aunt.     Agnis Hamm.

Tall and rawboned and 60. A rugged, maybe even handsome face, set
with ice-blue eyes. Calm, slightly scary eyes, that drift to his
robe...

                              AGNIS
                 You sick?     It's nine o'clock.

He is completely off-balance here.

                           QUOYLE
                 Uh. No, Bunny and I like to...
                 uh, early to bed, earl...

                           AGNIS
                 Losin' your wife, your folks, and
                 your job'd depress anybody. It's
                 a wonder you don't sleep all day.

Not that she seems to approve. Not at all. His eyes now drift to
the large, well-used SUITCASES dangling from her powerful hands.

                           AGNIS
                 Thought I'd stay a day or two.
                 Give you some relief with th...

And stops.   The mouth doesn't smile.     But the eyes crinkle slightly
toward...

...Bunny. Who has crept out in her jammies.         Hugging a sack of
Pepperidge Farm cookies like it was a teddy.

                          AGNIS (to Bunny)
                You like blue dogs named Warren?

The little girl nods.     As if she certainly does.

                          AGNIS
                I got one in the car.

INT. PARLOR - LATER

In the far corner of the room, Bunny plays with WARREN, a sweet,
ugly dog. Toothless and, undeniably, blue.

                          QUOYLE (O.S.)
                I never knew her, really.

See him now, sipping his tea.     Wallowing in the detritus of his
emotions.

                          QUOYLE
                But she was driven by terrible
                forces, no one could understand.
                She was a locked door. Even to me.

Agnis in the good chair. Teacup on her ample lap. Assessing a
photo on the end table, Petal's arctic eyes, rigidly seductive
pose. The snapshot enshrined by a neighboring votive rose in its
jelly jar glass.

                          AGNIS
                So she wasn't just a bitch in
                high heels?

Quoyle's eyes cut instinctively toward his daughter, her innocence
protected by distance and absorption with Warren's passivity.

                          AGNIS
                Don't stress. She mighta heard worse
                from her momma. I'm only guessin'.

                          QUOYLE
                Some people probably thought Petal
                was bad clear through.

                             AGNIS
                People.     Are a cynical lot.

                          QUOYLE
                I think she just couldn't get
                enough love.

Agnis' unblinking eyes.

                           AGNIS
                I think the evidence.     Is on
                your side.

The eyes study him.     Dissect him, even.

                             AGNIS
                   I'm headed north, Nephew, to
                   where our family comes from, in
                   Newfoundland. Thought I'd never
                   go back. But the older y'get...

Clucks her tongue.

                             AGNIS
                   There's a pull. Becomes an ache.
                   As if where your people started
                   held a purpose for you. Like
                   you're a piece in a puzzle...

Not a smile. But something.        A softening of timbre, a flicker
behind the eye.

                             AGNIS
                   ...lookin' for where y'fit.

Lifts her cup.

                               AGNIS
                   You, too.

Takes a sip.     His eyes have narrowed in a burlesque of suspicion.

                             QUOYLE
                   In what sense do you m...

                             AGNIS
                   You need to come, Nephew.

Just like that.

                             AGNIS
                   Nothin' here but hurt. You got
                   to start fresh, everythin's gone!

Hmmn?

                             AGNIS
                   The trip'll clear your head.
                   Be educational for the squirt.
                   Teach ya the world's still spinnin'
                   outside this toxic slice o'Hades.
                   And who knows...?

Tilts her head.     Who knows.

                             AGNIS
                   They must have a newspaper up
                   there. Somebody's gotta write it.

He just stares.     The blankest of the blank.

                            AGNIS
                  Tell the truth, I'd appreciate
                  the company. You two are pretty
                  much my family.

His face softens.       Hadn't thought of it that way.      And seeing
this...

                            AGNIS
                  A pot o'coffee would hit the spot.
                  Drop o'whiskey would fit nice in it.

She waits.   He rises.      And when he does...

                            AGNIS
                  Which one's my brother?

He blinks.   She looks at two URNS on the mantle.

                               QUOYLE
                  Uh.     There's Mom.   And that's Poppa.

The name of the funeral home tastefully stenciled.           He clears his
throat...

                            QUOYLE
                  Those are temporary.

                               AGNIS
                  Coffee.     And maybe a sweet.

Quoyle nods, glad to serve.       Heads off to the kitchen.      Agnis looks
at Bunny and Warren.

                            AGNIS
                  She needs to go outside.

                            BUNNY
                  I know why.

She runs out, the dog trotting after.        Alone now...

...Agnis pulls something from her large carpetbag purse.           It is an
oversized ZIPLOC BAG. She stands. Crosses to...

...her brother's urn. She removes the lid. Turns the huge Ziploc
upside down to COVER the urn. Then, in one deft movement...

...UPENDS the urn, a cascade of ash tumbling into the Ziploc.
Seals it. Sets it to one side. Then, from her purse...

...another ziploc already filled with replacement ashes. She pours
just enough into the urn. That should do it. Stashes the rest
back in her purse. Turns now to lift...

...the Ziploc with her brother's remains.     Stares at it.   Think
Hamlet with Yorrick's skull.

                             AGNIS
                   What say, Guy? The dumpster?

A beat.     Eyes flat and neutral.

                             AGNIS
                   Just a thought.

EXT. PHANTOM HIGHWAY - MISTY NIGHT

A world of fog and reflected high beams. Big rig pulls over, and
Petal climbs up and in, her short red dress fluttering about her
thighs.

The truck is roaring heedlessly through dense cloud. The DRIVER is
gross and bald, snot suspended from his nostrils. He lets go of
the wheel to run his hairy hands UNDER Petal's dress, while through
the shotgun window, we see...

...Quoyle FLYING along outside, like a superhero. Except he is
shocked bug-eyed by the tableau. The disgusting driver buries his
face in Petal's hair, she throws her head back laughing, and the
driver becomes Quoyle's FATHER, Quoyle silently SHRIEKING outside
the window, and SMASH cut to...

EXT. DECK, PORT-AUX-BASQUES FERRY - DAY

...Quoyle    blinking awake on the deck of a pitching ferry. Fog
and cliff    and the raw Atlantic. And SOARING alongside, an amazing
number of    MARITIME BIRDS...the gulls and terns seeming to stare
Quoyle in    the eye as they glide past. Maybe they prompted his
dream.

                             AGNIS (O.S.)
                   They draft off our air currents,
                   it's quite premeditated.

She stands at the rail.     Smoking, despite the wind.

                             AGNIS
                   They actually know the ferry
                   schedule. Show up on time
                   better'n the Newfies.

He smiles a seasick smile. Lurches from his bolted-down chair to
join her. She nods back toward...

...Bunny through the glass window, snuggled with Warren, feeding
the dog french fries.

                             AGNIS
                   ...image of m'sister, Feeny.
                   She's married to a falconer in
                   Arabia, now. Has to wear a black

                 thing over her face.

                           QUOYLE
                 Like the falcon.

She stares in his eyes. Yes, like the falcon.       They are growing on
each other in a companionable way.

                              AGNIS
                 Nice.     To be with family.

He smiles.   It is nice.

                           AGNIS
                 'Specially big shots. Who can
                 land a job with one phone call.

His smile changes color.      A quiet pride in the modest...

                            QUOYLE
                 Well, that was my friend Partridge.
                 Made the call. And it's just an
                 interview.

When Quoyle looks back in at Bunny, he sees she is staring off at
something with full attention. He follows her gaze to...

...a honey-haired MOTHER with her small BOY snuggled in her lap.
She is feeding him an ice cream bar with evident tenderness. And
though the child's face is blissfully vacant, she murmurs to him
with serious intent.

INT. CAR, GREAT NORTHERN PENINSULA - DAY

Quoyle driving a winding, rutted road, high above the coastline.
Cracked cliffs in volcanic glazes. Long-abandoned settlements
jutting from raw granite. Icebergs on the horizon above the
rumpled, creased fabric of a brilliant blue sea. Beside him...

                           AGNIS
                 On the map, here. Quoyle Point.
                 Named after us. You.

It all seems at once awe-inspiring, frighteningly lonely.      And
hostile as hell.

EXT. QUOYLE'S POINT - SUNSET

The car pulls up in a shroud of mist. Our family climbs out,
stares into what seems the center of a dense cloud, until...

...the fog LIFTS. And like a ghost, a GREEN HOUSE appears.       Then,
disappears. Then, APPEARS again. This time, to stay.

                           AGNIS (bottomless pride)
                 I was born here.

                          BUNNY
                The green makes me hurl.
                    (Warren whimpers)
                Her, too.

The cloud lifts further, and we see the house stands alone on a
rocky point. The bay roils far below. Half the window panes are
gone. Holes in the roof, paint flaking everywhere. Lonely and
scary as any haunted house.

                          AGNIS
                Empty 44 years. And look at that
                roofline, straight as a ruler.

Quoyle looks at her.     Looks at the house.   Looks at her.

                          QUOYLE
                Take it easy. Floor mighta fallen
                into the cellar.

                          AGNIS (laughs)
                Not likely. There is no cellar.
                No foundation, neither.

She takes Bunny's squirming hand and starts toward the house, as if
crossing Jordan.

                          AGNIS (calling back)
                The whole thing's lashed with cable,
                to iron rings set in the rock!

He just stands there.     Sees the cables now, the rings.

                             QUOYLE (calling out)
                Uh.     Why would they do th...

                          AGNIS (calling back)
                Long story!

Apparently a private one, too.     Keeps walking.

INT. GREEN HOUSE - TWILIGHT

Inside the dank, corroding place. We can feel all 44 years of
abandonment. CRASH! The door FLIES open. Quoyle with his tire
iron steps aside, and...

...Agnis drags Bunny inside. The wind shrieking low through
openings like proper spirits. Even this bold child is frightened.
So Agnis leans to murmur...

                          AGNIS
                Up those stairs, Aunt Pinkie slept.
                So fat she couldn't get down to her
                chamber pot. Wanna see if she's
                still there?

Asked as a serious question.     Bunny nods.   Let's.

ANGLE...upstairs now. Agnis marching through like MacArthur
reclaiming the Philippines. Room after rough-hewn spacious room,
light spiking through a thousand roof holes in assorted shapes.

                             AGNIS
                   Well. Too late to drive that road
                   back 'round the bay. We'll camp
                   in here tonight. Be right as rain.

Quoyle looks down to his daughter.     Who nods, as if that were a
perfectly natural suggestion.

                             BUNNY
                   Which one's Petal's room?   I'll
                   sleep there.

INT. GREEN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

CLOSE on Bunny's sleeping face.     PUSH INTO her closed eyes, and
FADE to...

...a WINDOW, unearthly tendrils of FOG drifting past in moonglow
wisps. Suddenly, a FACE appears, an animal. White. Wolf, or more
likely, dog. It stares in at us, is fleetingly joined by a
grizzled HUMAN ghost, eyes FLASHING crazy, and...

...gone in mist.     CUT to...

REAR ANGLE of Quoyle and Bunny, each rolled over onto one side,
asleep in their sleeping bags. His arm across her protectively.
Hers across Warren, who sleeps curled to her chest. PAN up to...

...the window.     Only the shimmer of cloud-like mist.     SNAP to...

REVERSE ANGLE...Bunny's eyes.     wide open.

INT. ROOM - DAWN

CLOSE on Quoyle, stirring at the end of sleep.        His eyes flutter
open. A beat. He is alone. sits...

...BOLT UPRIGHT.

ANGLE...front hallway, Quoyle's bulk POUNDING toward us, boots in
his hand. The front door ajar. And at the threshold, in a
decorous semi-circle, six naked Barbies. Legs spread wide for
balance. Each staring out the doorway, to where...

...Bunny sits on the cold ground. Making some craft project with
great care. Quoyle can breathe again, she's safe. Ambles out,
crouches beside her. Close.

She keeps working. Almost eerie concentration. He sees now that
she is weaving a loop of dandelion stems, connected by aluminum pop
tops. He leans down. Kisses her head.

                          QUOYLE
                Is that a belt or a crown?

No answer. That concerns him. The intensity of her focus. He
notices now, the soda and beer cans with their tops popped. Lined
up in a row. He lifts one, liquid sloshes out. They're full.

                          QUOYLE
                Sodas get flat withou...

                          BUNNY
                This is important.

She won't look up.     He glances back to the doorway.

                          QUOYLE
                That why the Barbies are
                watching?

                          BUNNY
                They're being nice and patient.

                          QUOYLE
                They must be chilly, tho.     Should
                I get their clo...

                          BUNNY
                They look better this way.        They
                have great bodies.

He looks back. Well. Maybe so. Holds up one of the heavy boots
he's carrying. It has a thick blue shoelace. The other. Has
none. Sticks that one in front of her face.

She looks up to him.     Tugs on the shoelace, which she now wears as
a necklace...

                             BUNNY
                I need it.     I look good in blue.

                             QUOYLE (smiles)
                Well.     I look good in shoes.

...sees now what she has tugged from inside her shirt.     The
shoelace necklace holds a dull metal KEY as a pendant.     He blinks.

                          QUOYLE
                I was lookin' for that all over
                our old place. The landlady s...

                             BUNNY
                I need it.

He takes that in.    The urgency of it.   She is staring in his eyes.
So he grins...

                          QUOYLE
                You had quite the heavy morning.
                Take the rest of the day off.

She doesn't smile back. Returns to her work. He looks out by the
cliff, to see Agnis staring across the bay, Warren sitting at her
side. He pulls on his boots. Gets to his feet.

                          QUOYLE
                Be right back, and we'll start
                talking breakf...

                          BUNNY (not looking up)
                Watch out for the dog.

He looks across the ground toward old Warren.

                          QUOYLE
                Yeh, her farts are pretty scary.

                             BUNNY
                I mean.     The white one!

Now their eyes meet.    Matter-of-fact...

                          BUNNY
                The White Dog with the big
                teeth and the red eyes. The
                Skinny Ghost owns him. They
                came last night.

He draws a breath...

                          BUNNY
                I didn't dream 'em, don't say
                I did.

He thinks this over.

                          QUOYLE
                I was gonna say.     I'll keep my
                eyes peeled.

And makes a funny gesture, like peeling his eyeballs. She goes
back to work. His eyes linger. Then, he heads off toward the
cliff. When he gets there...

                          AGNIS (staring across the bay)
                I'll get us a carpenter. Fix
                the place up in no time. We'll
                find a rooming house til th...

                          QUOYLE
                Be cheaper to build a new one.
                On the Riviera, even.

Now she looks at him.     Her flat, bottomless eyes.

                          AGNIS
                Only I weren't born.     On the
                Riviera.

O-kay. That's settled. He nods, humbly, dumbly.         She points off
across the water. An actual TOWN.

                          AGNIS
                Flour Sack Cove. What time's
                your interview at that paper?
                Ten o'clock?

Ten o'clock.

                           AGNIS
                The drive's a bitch.     We'll buy
                us a boat.

He tries a smile.    Unavoidably lame.

                             QUOYLE
                I'm not.     A water person.

                             AGNIS (dead straight)
                A boat.     That's the ticket.

His grin hardens. Just enough to say that on this issue, maybe
even she can't push him. He turns around. Starts back toward his
daughter.

                          QUOYLE
                ...not a water person.

INT. CAR - MORNING

Quoyle driving alone in his best suit. Which is also his worst
suit. Which is also the suit he wore to interview Ed Punch, years
ago. Hard rain. Potholes. Around a curve, to see ahead...

REAR ANGLE of a tall WOMAN, holding the hand of a CHILD as they
walk in their slickers through the downpour. As he passes them,
they TURN and..

...the woman is Petal.     The child is Bunny.    They both stick their
tongues out at him.

Past now. Looking in the rear-view. The woman is lovely and
no longer Petal. The child is a BOY, with a slack face and warm
smile. Surprisingly, the same mother and son that Bunny watched on
the ferry.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                Someone found a pretty wife.

Still staring in the mirror.     The receding figures small against
the rain.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                Someone always does.

EXT. THE GAMMY BIRD - DAY

Quoyle pulls up to a ramshackle place, its sign: THE GAMMY BIRD
over a painted quacking duck. As he climbs out, he hears SHOUTING
from inside. A door opens, and...

...a crab-Iike figure scuttles out, jumps in a Toyota truck, turns
the key. Kills the engine. He looks out at Quoyle standing in
what's left of the rain. Climbs back out. Rasps...

                          CARD
                As you can see, sometimes y'can't
                get away. I'm Tert X. Card, the
                bloody so-called managing editor,
                copyeditor, rewrite man, mechanicals,
                ad makeup department, mail and
                distribution chief, and snow shoveler.

More of a leering rictus than an actual smile. TERT CARD is aging,
balding, potbellied over a once-rawboned frame. His face looks
like cottage cheese clawed with a fork. He scratches his balls
with a rough-hewn hand. He is never happy.

                          CARD
                And you are either a big advertiser
                come to buy a four-page spread to
                push your warehouse of left-footed
                Japanese boots. Or. You. Are the
                breathlessly-awaited Quoyle.

                          QUOYLE
                That'd be me. The second one.

Card rakes his privates once more, and offers the same hand in
dubious greeting. Quoyle takes it.

                          CARD
                Have to do without the Ultimate
                Cheese, y'will. Himself, Mr. Jack
                Buggit, is up at the house having
                charms said over his scrawny chest to
                clear out that impressive accumulation
                of phlegm he's been hawking all week.

Claps a mirthless hand on Quoyle's back, leading him into...

INT. GAMMY BIRD NEWSROOM - DAY

A newsroom. Makes the Mockingburg Record look like the Washington
Post. Only two employees at their vintage desks. Card points as
he bellows...

                            CARD

                  Now, there's Billy Pretty. He's
                  something of a landmark and an
                  old fish dog.

BILLY PRETTY is wizened and wiry, pushing 70. A tiny, energetic
creature with well-weathered hide, watering crystal-blue eyes, and
a slanted smile. He waves a bony hand.

                            CARD
                  Billy does the Home News page.
                  Poems, baby photos, household
                  tips, and a gossip column, under
                  the byline of Junior Sugg, that
                  is pretty much straight libel.

Billy nods.    That pretty much covers it.

                            CARD
                  In short. He writes the only
                  stuff anybody actually reads.

Little salute from the Managing Editor.      If Card likes anybody, he
likes Billy. And he doesn't.

                            CARD
                  Now this miserable ugly Brit, is
                  B. Beaufield Nutbeem. Imagines
                  he's the foreign news chief. Steals
                  every story off that foul shortwave
                  radio and rewrites it in Limey prose.

                            NUTBEEM (smiling)
                  Which bloody Card rewrites in a
                  mystical tongue most charitably
                  referenced as an unacquireable taste.

NUTBEEM is 50 and gangly. Buttery hair swept behind ample ears.
A thin moustache, a bounteous bowtie, a ratty pullover. He opens a
file folder. Gives Quoyle a piercing, meaningful glance.

                            NUTBEEM
                  Mine: 'Burmese sawmill owners and
                  the Rangoon Development Corporation
                  met in Tokyo Tuesday to consider a
                  joint approach to marketing tropical
                  hardwoods.'

Got it?   Turns the page.

                            NUTBEEM
                  Card's rewrite: 'Burnoosed sawbill
                  awnings and the Ranger Devotional
                  Competition met Wednesday near
                  Tokyo to mark up local hairwood.'

A stunned.    Silence.

                           CARD
                 It's shorter, and I got Tokyo right.

                           NUTBEEM
                 If misspelled.

                           CARD
                 Now what's funnier, Quoyle? My
                 writing style, or the fantasy that
                 any Newfie would read that
                 moosepuckey in the first pIa...

                           QUOYLE (to Nutbeem)
                 How'd the meeting go? Did they
                 agree on a joint marketing approach?

The beginning.   Of a beautiful friendship.

                           NUTBEEM (gentle smile)
                 Still in progress, old bean.
                 One can only hope.

Card, who likes no one.   Doesn't like Quoyle, too.

                           CARD
                 There's your miserable desk, Quoyle.
                 We've got no idea what yer s'posed
                 to do. But Mr. Jack Buggit will
                 drop by someday and enlighten us
                 all. Til then...

And he turns away. Through the swinging door.       SLAM.   Quiet.
Except for Nutbeem's chuckle.

EXT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY

Quoyle pulls up beside the ancestral home. Agnis stands at the
back of a rented truck, sorting through materials in the payload.
Across a stretch of ground, Bunny is earnestly pretend-reading a
book to Warren, who lies listlessly before her.

Quoyle comes up behind Agnis.   He carries a newspaper and an
excited air.

                           QUOYLE
                 Listen to this. 'Well, we see
                 the postman has landed in jail for
                 45 days for throwing the mail in
                 Killick-Claw Harbor. He said he
                 had too much to deliver, and folks
                 could just take a dip and help
                 themselves.'

He looks up, eager for her reaction. She is still sorting through
bolts of thick cloth, spools of heavy thread, odd mechanical
devices.

                           QUOYLE
                 This is great stuff. 'A snowmobile
                 mishap has taken the life of 78-year-
                 old Rick Puff, who was on his way
                 home from what the Widow Puff calls
                 a 'screech-in and a carouse,' when his
                 machine fell through the ice. A well-
                 known accordion player, Mr. Puff had
                 served four years in the 1970s for
                 sexual assault on his daughters. Bet
                 they aren't crying, either.' This
                 Billy Pretty can really write!

                           AGNIS (absently)
                 ...passes as colorful.

He looks into the truck.      Sees all the stuff.   She surveys his
puzzlement.

                           AGNIS
                 Nephew, we can't fix up the house
                 proper on a journalist's wages.
                 So I have un-retired.

Oh.   Absorbs that.

                              QUOYLE
                 From what?

                           AGNIS
                 Upholstery. Been sought after for
                 33 years, wherever I've lived.
                 This should be the real test, huh?

Quoyle nods. Could be that. The sudden sound of footsteps above
them, makes him look up sharply, to see...

...a fit young MAN in a toolbelt climbing down a ladder from the
roof. The muscles of a stud, the shy smile of a boy, he waves a
greeting and HOPS down the last six feet to the ground.

                            AGNIS
                 This is Dennis Buggit, master
                 carpenter.

DENNIS offers a hand, and a smile that says he's expecting to like
you. Makes the sentiment contagious.

                           DENNIS
                 Only til I get my lobster license.
                 I'm a fisherman in my soul.

A strong handshake.   On both sides.

                           DENNIS
                 It's a Newfie thing, the compulsion
                 to fish. Y'hear yesterday's tragedy

                   'bout the Newfie who went ice fishin'?

Quoyle hasn't.

                             DENNIS
                   Brought home 200 pounds of ice. His
                   wife fried it. They both drowned.

Quoyle laughs good and honest.      Dennis likes that.

                             AGNIS
                   With me workin', we'll need day
                   care for Bunny after school. Turns
                   out Dennis and his wife send their
                   little girl to this wonderful saintly
                   woman. How's that for us livin' a
                   charmed life?

Quoyle nods, if a bit cautious.      Dennis squints out across the bay.

                             DENNIS
                   Agnis says yer buyin' a boat.
                   Sooner's prob'ly better'n lat...

                             QUOYLE (quiet smile)
                   I'm not buyin'. No boat.

Sounds pretty sure of that.      Punctures the amiable ambiance with a
shard of silence.

                             AGNIS
                   Well, course we're buy...

                             QUOYLE (to Dennis)
                   Buggit, huh? Any kin to my boss on
                   the Gammy Bird?

The silence.     Just got thunderous.   A full beat.

                              DENNIS (low)
                   Oh, yeh.   He's m'dad.

Even the eyes glance down.      What is that?   In the wake of it...

                             AGNIS (cheerful)
                   Gonna chat up yer daughter, or just
                   ignore her as usual?

Quoyle nods. Better do that. Dennis sends a shy smile, as if
apologizing for the awkwardness. Quoyle holds up a finger, be
right back, and...

...heads on over to where Bunny is reading to Warren.

                             BUNNY
                   Warren threw up in your sleeping bag.
                   She's got a stomach problem.

Quoyle takes a breath to answer, but stops.     He's caught a whiff.

                             QUOYLE (V.O.)
                Headline.     Dog Fart Fells Freelance
                Reporter.     Promising Career Nipped
                in Bud.

                          BUNNY
                It's called cancer.

Oh. Quoyle holds his face together, as Bunny strokes the limp
Warren. Then, he crouches down...

...strokes Warren, too.     Good dog.

INT. GAMMY BIRD - MORNING

Quoyle enters. Billy Pretty's on the phone, hand cupped over the
receiver, like it's top secret. Nutbeem's tuning his ancient
shortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought
to be. And as Quoyle sets down his sack lunch and thermos, as he
peels off his parka, he's staring straight into the eyes of...

...Tert Card across the way. Wearing a wicked and mysterious
smile. As Quoyle's butt lowers toward his chair...

                          BOOMING VOICE (O.S.)
                ATTENTION QUOYLE!

Ouoyle JUMPS a foot.   Looks from Card to Billy to Nutbeem.    What's
going on?

                          BOOMING VOICE (O.S.)
                IT'S AN I.Q. TEST, ME OLD SON, AND
                YOU AIN'T EXCELLING!

WHIPS around. Through the glass of the only private office, sits a
rumpled codger with a bullhorn. JACK BUGGIT, has his rubber boots
up on the desk, scale-spattered overalls over his compact, sinewy
body. His hair is wisps and shocks, and his face is strewn with
stubble split by a leprechaun's grin around a stained hand-rolled
ciggie.

                          JACK (into bullhorn)
                DOES PAYIN' YER SHAMEFUL WAGE ENTITLE
                ME TO A PERSONAL AUDIENCE? OR WOULDJA
                RATHER JUST STAND THERE AN' DROOL?

                          NUTBEEM
                Tell the truth.

Jack WAVING him in, with great energetic loops. The grin more
rowdy than his boy's. But the charm is there and more so. Quoyle
goes...

                             CARD (O.S.)

                 Hold onto yer danglies, little
                 sister.

...closes the door behind him. Jack's eyes are crinkly blue.   They
study Quoyle good. And right in his face...

                           JACK (into bullhorn)
                 I PREDICT! A COCKADOODLE-BRIGHT
                 FUTURE IN JOURNALISM!

                           QUOYLE
                 Based on my I.Q. test, huh.   Where'd
                 I rate?

                           JACK (sets the bullhorn down)
                 Advanced squirrel. This ties you
                 with me, an' I own the place.

Holds out a brown fisherman's hand.   Quoyle takes it.

                           JACK
                 Pleased t'meetcha, Billy says yer
                 workin' out.

A wink.

                           JACK
                 Tert Card says he's keepin' an eye
                 on ya. Since he's a self-servin'
                 liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it
                 means he's jealous. And Nutbeem...

Lifts the bullhorn...

                           JACK (into bullhorn)
                 NUTBEEM'S TEMPORARY ANYWAY! YOU HEAR
                 THAT NUTBEEM!

                           NUTBEEM (O.S., through glass)
                 WITH PROFOUND RELIEF!

Jack's grin grows a twinkle.   Soft spot for the Brit.

                           JACK
                 Nutbeem's obsessed with actual news.
                 Makes up for it by manning the sexual
                 abuse desk. Can't keep up with the
                 volume there, we're runnin' three,
                 four a week.

Leans forward.   Like he's dishing the lowdown.

                           JACK
                 Card's in charge. Ya hear this and
                 that 'bout his typos, but typos is
                 part of Gammy Bird. Everyone gets
                 a laugh, and gets to figger 'em out.

                   Better'n a crossword.

Stabs out his cigarette.     Pulls a new one from a damp little box.

                              JACK
                   An' Billy. Well, Billy's a writer
                   and a fisherman. Me, I'm just a
                   fisherman.

Offers the box.     Quoyle shakes him off.

                             JACK
                   Fishin' and the sea is all I am.
                   My pap the same. My boy.

                             QUOYLE
                   So he said. Waitin' for his license.

Ah. Jack's smile doesn't actually fade.       But the eyes flicker, and
Quoyle is sorry he opened his yap.

                             JACK
                   Naw, my boy's passed. Went to sea
                   and there he rests. Bless his bones.

His glance goes to a photo. Jack and a strapping blond son.
Not Dennis, that's for sure. Somehow, we are suddenly down to
business...

                             JACK
                   Want two things from ya, Quoyle.
                   First. You cover every local car
                   wreck, take pictures. Front-page
                   photo every week, whether we have a
                   wreck or not, an' we always do. When
                   we don't, we dip into Card's file,
                   he's got some beauties.

INTERCUT...half a red Geo being fished out of the water. Petal's
lifeless torso hanging backwards out the door, arms gracefully
extended like a ballerina or Olympic diver. Over this...

                             JACK (O.S.)
                   Knack to this. If there's a dark
                   patch on the ground, it reads blood,
                   whether it's motor oil or Diet Coke.
                   Gloves, hat, lyin' in the road...

BACK to Jack.     Canny and keen.   He knows this stuff.

                             JACK
                   ...somethin' that humanizes, makes
                   ya feel. That's what a wreck is.
                   It's always saying, 'There but for
                   the grace of God...'

Do ya follow?     Quoyle follows.

                            JACK
                  Plus. We're starting a feature on
                  the shipping news. What ships come
                  in, what goes out. Whatever's of
                  interest. Throwin' it to you, son.
                  Chance to shine.

A beat.

                            QUOYLE
                  Mr. Buggit. I'm not.     Well, a
                  water person.

Ah.   Jack takes this in.     The smile returns.

                              JACK
                  Chance.    To shine.

If you catch my drift.      Quoyle shuts up.

                            JACK
                  One peculiarity. I'm no joke,
                  son, and I don't tolerate jokes
                  about Newfies. Or them that does.

SMASH CUT to...

INT. SKIPPER WILL'S DINER - NIGHT

CLOSE on Dennis, holding a half-eaten squidburger in two hands.
Oblivious to sawdust, smoke and stench, he is charmingly,
engagingly, smashed.

                            DENNIS
                  So this Newfie comes to Toronto.
                  Cabbie says, take ya to meet girls
                  for a good time. Boy says, okay,
                  but I only want a Newfie girl.

His audience is Quoyle and Nutbeem. Each holds a squidburger of
his own, tentacles dangling. Quoyle has his next one handy by his
beer.

                            DENNIS
                  Right section of the party district,
                  he finds a girl, they have sex,
                  she says that's a hunnerd dollars.
                  He says fine, tips her another
                  hunnerd! She says, wow, can y'come
                  back t'morrow?

Quoyle takes a humongus BITE.      Tentacles now dripping from his
jaws. Rapt. Hypnotized.

                            DENNIS
                  Next two nights, same thing!

                   Finally she says, I never met so
                   sweet a guy, where ya from? He says,
                   Misky Bay, Newfoundland. She says,
                   really? Me, too!

Quoyle hanging on the punch.

                             DENNIS
                   He says, I know. Yer ma asked me
                   t'give ya six hunnerd dollars!

Quoyle SNORTS his laughter, dislodging a tentacled morsel or two.
Nutbeem has to look away, as Quoyle retrieves the chunks, stuffs
'em back in his mouth.

                             DENNIS
                   Yer the model Newfie, Q, but fer
                   th'boat. Why doncha buy Nutbeem's?

Drunken, devilish smile.     Quoyle turns, innocent questioning eyes.
You got a boat?

                             NUTBEEM
                   I built a Chinese junk. Sailed it
                   up from Brazil. Missed Manhattan by
                   a mile or so, got stranded here when
                   I shipwrecked by Gaze Island.

So casual and falsely modest, Quoyle's eyes are big.

                             NUTBEEM
                   Almost finished my repairs. Be
                   leaving soon. As paleontologists
                   define the term.

Studies Quoyle's amazement.     Confides...

                             NUTBEEM
                   She's ugly. And the only thing
                   I've ever loved.

Dennis rises.   Belches.

                             DENNIS
                   Yer story tugs at me bladder.

And off he lurches to correct the situation.       Once he's gone...

                             QUOYLE
                   Him and Jack. Tell it.

Their eyes meet.     The Brit sighs.

                             NUTBEEM
                   Jack Buggit's psychic, start with
                   that. He's got the gift. Specially
                   about the sea.

Thinking. Should he tell it?      Quoyle makes a rolling hand motion,
hurry it up.

                             NUTBEEM
                   Older brother Jesson, everyone's
                   favorite, even Dennis'. Goes to
                   sea like his dad. One day, rest
                   of the family's sitting by the radio,
                   and Jack goes white...

That's right.

                             NUTBEEM
                   Stands up. Says, Jesson's gone.
                   Walks out of the house. Grief too
                   big for walls to hold it.

Sets down the burger.     Runs a finger down the frost on his beer
mug.

                             NUTBEEM
                   So Dennis is forbidden the sea.
                   But being free, Newfie, and 21,
                   he goes anyway.

                             QUOYLE
                   And that's enough t...?

                             NUTBEEM
                   Death storm. Monster wave cracks
                   her steel hull amidships, one inch
                   crack from starboard to port. Men
                   go in the water. Dennis lost.
                   After a week...

A week.

                             NUTBEEM
                   They come to Jack, call off the
                   search. He stands like a stone. Then
                   turns, sharp, the way he does. Says
                   only, 'He's alive. And I know where.'

                             QUOYLE
                   Man's a witch.

                             NUTBEEM
                   Went to sea, alone, in just a skiff.
                   Finds him. Can you guess the odds?
                   Finds him. Finds him. Both arms
                   broke, 99% dead.

Leans.    Close.

                             NUTBEEM
                   Boy comes to. Jack says if you ever

                 step in a boat again, I'll drown ya
                 m'self. And you know what the kid
                 said...?

Quoyle glances over.      Dennis wobbling his way back through the
tables.

                           QUOYLE
                 Say it fast.

                           NUTBEEM
                 Says fishin' licenses are all spoken
                 for, I'd appreciate you givin' me
                 yours. Jack looked in his eyes.
                 They never spoke ag...

                           DENNIS
                 What's bein' blabbed here?

                           NUTBEEM (not missing a beat)
                 Quoyle says you got a nice ass.

                           DENNIS
                 Quoyle's right.

He raises his beer.

                              DENNIS
                 To my ass.

                           QUOYLE
                 I'll drink to that.

And, by God.   They do.

EXT. WAVEY'S YARD - AFTERNOON

Quoyle and Bunny climb out of the wagon. A small house, its grassy
yard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures,
galloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcaps
on sticks. A zoo of the mind. To one side, a table piled with
crafts, ignored by...

...fifteen LITTLE KIDS running in all directions, like bundled,
unbridled banshees. Looks like fun. Two harried MOTHERS are
trying to cope with the chaos. And there, under a tree...

...the honey-haired WOMAN Quoyle had seen on the ferry. And in
the rain. She is on her knees, tying the shoes of her vacant-faced
SON. He trips and sprawls, but he is laughing. The woman smiles
tenderly and tousles his brown-straw hair.

Quoyle gets up his courage. Walks Bunny over to them.       As we
arrive, the woman looks up...

                              QUOYLE (really nervous)
                 Hullo.     It's our first day, and I

                  was wond...

                            BUNNY
                  What's wrong with him?

Quoyle freezes.    She means, of course, the blankly-staring boy.

                            QUOYLE
                  Hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong
                  with you? There's nothing wr...

                            WOMAN (to Bunny, softly)
                  Sure, there is. This is Herry, and
                  he has Down's Syndrome. It means
                  he learns things very slowly.

Oh.   HERRY smiles at Bunny.      Suddenly, wonderfully.

                            BUNNY (to Herry)
                  Know how to be a dog?

She DROPS to all fours and starts YAPPING like a terrier. Herry
LAUGHS with delight. Tumbles down to the grass and does his
impression of a Chihuahua on speed.

                            BUNNY (to the woman)
                  He looks fast to me. Maybe he's
                  cured.

                               WOMAN
                  Maybe.

The kids waddle off in their canine personas. Alone with the woman
now, Quoyle is near-catatonic. Come on, brain!

                            QUOYLE
                  Which one of those women is in
                  charge here?

The woman looks at him. Clear cornflower eyes. As comfortable in
silence as he is agonized. Then, she squints out at the other
women, desperately running ragged after the kids.

                            WOMAN
                  Neither of 'em.      They're just moms.

Oh.

                            QUOYLE
                  Well, my lord, whoever runs the
                  place should be giving this a
                  little more attention.

She looks back at him, blankly.

                               WOMAN
                  You think.

                            QUOYLE
                  I mean, children need structure.
                  No one's even guarding that craft
                  table, they could be running around
                  with scissors and get hurt.

The woman's eyes bottomless, unreadable.       The silence excruciating
for poor Quoyle. He clears his throat.

                             QUOYLE
                  Um.   I write for the newspa...

But she stands.    The grace and quickness of a jungle cat.

                           WOMAN
                  Well. I'd better get to work, I
                  see. Providing structure and all.

Brushes off her skirt.       He is in the dawning panic of beginning to
realize...

                            WAVEY
                  I'm Wavey Prowse, and this is
                  my place. Pardon our antiquated
                  emphasis on individuality and the
                  freedom to have fun.

Heads off with a loose-limbed stride.       Spins back around...

                               WAVEY
                  Oh, yeh.     Running with sharp
                  objects?     We save for Tuesdays.

Got it? He gawks like a stupid animal.        Nods, got it.   She's
already gone.

EXT. BARGE DECK - DAY

Quoyle and Billy Pretty stroll the teak deck of a massive,
elegantly-outfitted BARGE. The wiry little fellow keeps his
smile to his eyes...

                            BILLY
                  Well, she don't wear a ring, cause
                  she lost her husband at sea. Just
                  after the boy was born.

Oh.   Quoyle nods, blandly.      As if it is a matter of no real concern

                            QUOYLE
                  Well, I was just...

                            BILLY
                  ...sharpenin' those observation
                  skills. First tool of a quality
                  reporter.

Keep walking.

                           QUOYLE
                 She has wonderful.     Posture.

                           BILLY (has to smile)
                 Yer know, I never notic...

                           MELVILLE (O.S.)
                 JESUS F. CHRIST! YOU BOYS WANT THIS
                 STORY OR NOT?

Look up ahead to the bow, where a rolling bar has been set up.
BAYONET MELVILLE is mixing drinks. He has a florid face and
striking white hair. Dapper, arrogant, a guy with more money than
he's worked for. As we approach...

                           MELVILLE
                 Ever seen anything like her?

Quoyle looks to the sour-faced middle-aged lady, who glances
disdainfully at us above her gimlet. SILVER MELVILLE used to be
pretty and rich. She's still rich.

                           QUOYLE (politely)
                 No sir, your wife is very lovl...

                            MELVILLE
                 I mean.   The ship.

Oh.   Billy keeps a straight face.     Silver ROLLS her eyes.

                           MELVILLE
                 It was built for Hitler. You've
                 heard of Hitler? Up here in Canada?

                           QUOYLE
                 Oh, yessir. He was in all the
                 papers. Way back.

Silver snorts a laugh. Melville wonders if that was irony.
Looking at Quoyle, he doubts that's possible.

                           MELVILLE
                 Finest botterjacht ever built in
                 Holland. Flat-bottomed, she can
                 go right up on shore in a storm.
                 Incredibly heavy, forty tons of oak.
                 Not unlike the barges of Henry VIII
                 and Elizabeth I.

                           BILLY (helpful)
                 We heard a them, too.

                           SILVER
                 Tell them what happened.     In

                  Hurricane Bob.

He looks at his wife. Clear in a glance they hate each other's
guts. Go on, she nods. Tell it.

                            MELVILLE
                  Pounded twelve beach houses.
                  Expensive ones. To rubble.

                               SILVER
                  WHAMM!

Drunk and mean.    And smarter than he is.

                            SILVER
                  Now tell them. Who let our
                  insurance lapse.

Silence.

                            SILVER
                  Took six very expensive lawyers to
                  weasel us out of it. An inch from
                  bankruptcy.

She winks.

                            SILVER
                  Moral of the story? When you marry
                  a tour guide. Confine his authority
                  to mixing the drinks. Same again,
                  dear?

And holds out her glass.       Billy looks out to sea.   Like he hasn't
heard this.

                            QUOYLE (cheerful)
                  So. What brings you folks up
                  from Long Island?

A beat.    While husband and wife glare at each other.

                            SILVER
                  My dining salon needs refitting.
                  And the best custom yacht upholsterer
                  in the Northern Hemisphere just
                  moved here. I was forced. To follow.

She turns to Quoyle.       Who just gapes at her.   Open-mouthed.

                               QUOYLE (softly)
                  Oh.   My.    God.

INT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY

Quoyle enters, impressed by the progress of the renovation.
Windows are in, walls patched, floor sanded, lights are working.

Through the place into...

...the kitchen, which is in surprisingly usable shape. Agnis sits
alone at a butcher block table with a set of ledgers spread before
her. A large mug of tea. A bottle of Bushmill's Irish.

                             QUOYLE
                   You are a woman of mystery, Aunt.
                   Mystery and surprise.

                             AGNIS (still working)
                   Silver Melville says you was out
                   there. Be nice in yer story, she's
                   payin' for a piece of this house.

Silence.

                             QUOYLE
                   You said upholstery.   Never said
                   yacht uphol...

                             AGNIS
                   ...never said not. Ask better
                   questions, you got a chance fer
                   better answers. Got my shop set
                   up in Killick-Claw, now.

Looks up.    Sees he's dazzled by how she moves right along.

                             AGNIS
                   Two good workers. Mrs. Mavis
                   Bangs is an old plow horse like
                   m'self. But Dawn...

She winks.

                              AGNIS
                   Dawn's young and on the sexy
                   side. You oughta drop by and
                   say hullo.

He absorbs that.     How fast can he change the subject?

                             QUOYLE
                   Where's Bunny?

Agnis looks at him.     Reaches for the Bushmill's.

                             AGNIS
                   Upstairs, in what will soon become
                   her room. She'll be all right.

                             QUOYLE
                   What does that mean?

She pours some whiskey into her tea cup.

                            QUOYLE
                  Little early in the day f...

                            AGNIS
                  Warren died today.    That's what that means.

Drinks the whiskey.    Stares straight in his eyes.     Sees his sorrow.
The honesty in...

                            QUOYLE
                  Poor old girl.

Agnis deciding.    Whether to tell him...

                            AGNIS
                  I used to live with someone named
                  Warren. Died of cancer, after
                  nine years together. Dearest soul
                  on this earth.

Quoyle shocked. What can he say? His empathy so naked, so real,
even Agnis has to soften her voice...

                            AGNIS
                  Went from the funeral, and bought
                  that dog. Named her Warren. Just
                  so I could say the name a hunnerd
                  times a day. Women are foolish, huh?

                            QUOYLE
                  I never thought so.

A good moment for them.    It holds a beat.

                            AGNIS
                  Bunny wants to bury the dog with
                  me. But I told her I'd rather do
                  it alone.

Quoyle nods.   Rises slowly.   He'd better go to her.

                            AGNIS
                  Some advice about the child?

Another sip.

                            AGNIS
                  Don't get down on her level, the way
                  you do. She'll never respect you.

INT. BUNNY'S ROOM - DAY

Bunny sits on the floor in dim light, wearing an enormous blue
sweatshirt. Obviously dad's. Her naked Barbies sit in a semi-
circle watching her braid a meticulous loop out of the paper and
foil from chewing gum wrappers. Quoyle enters, and sits close
beside her. Watches in silence, as she works.

                            BUNNY (not looking up)
                  Warren died today. She's not
                  coming back.

No tears.   Just a hollow sound in her voice.

                            BUNNY
                  That's the difference.

He knows what she means.      Strokes her hair.

                            QUOYLE
                  Another necklace, huh?    Can
                  I help?

                            BUNNY
                  You can watch.

Okay.   He looks at the Barbies.

                            QUOYLE
                  Do I have to take my clothes off?

She looks up at him.     Straight to his eyes.

                            BUNNY
                  You look better with 'em on.

Goes back to work.     He watches her.

                              QUOYLE
                  You know.    You do look good
                  in blue.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Quoyle driving the wagon, Dennis at his side. Up ahead on the
road, two figures. Herry holds tight to his mom's hand. Quoyle
pulls over, and they stop. Wavey squints at him, against the sun.

                            QUOYLE
                  Give you folks a lift?

That extra beat before she says...

                            WAVEY
                  We're enjoyin' the walk, thank you.

Doesn't smile.    Doesn't look angry either.      Just comfortable.

                            QUOYLE
                  Well. My aunt can't bring Bunny to
                  the daycare, she's got her shop now.
                  But I worked it out with my boss. So
                  I'll be bringin' her come next week.

No reaction.

                            QUOYLE
                  If that's all right.

                            WAVEY
                  Love to have her. I'm sorry,
                  Mr. Quoyle, about the other time.
                  Women can be moody, you know. And
                  temperamental.

Now she smiles.    One-tenth power.     Still a dazzler.

                            QUOYLE
                  Only the best ones.

Did she like that?    Hard to tell.     She looks around him...

                            WAVEY
                  Good afternoon, Dennis. Give our
                  respects to Beety and Marty.

He waves, will do. She takes Herry's hand, starts off down the
road. Quoyle sits and watches.

                            DENNIS
                  Excellent posture.

Quoyle looks over.    His pal shrugs.

                            DENNIS
                  People talk.

EXT. SHORELINE - SUNSET

Rear ANGLE of Agnis, walking over stones to the edge of the sea,
carrying something in her arms. Walking to meet the sun, as it
gives its last to the shimmering water. REVERSE ANGLE to see...

...she carries her old dog. On a clean sheet. Rests the burden
gently down. The incoming tide laps over. The sheet billows in
it. She takes a step back.

                            AGNIS
                  You were a good girl, Warren, no
                  trouble a'tall.

Surf rolls out.    Swims back in.     Flows around her friend.

EXT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY

An outhouse stands unobtrusively near the edge of the cliff. See
Agnis alone, approaching. Something in her hand. As she reaches
the outhouse, we see it is...

...the ziploc bag. With her brother's ashes.        She gazes back at
the house now. Then, at the bag...

                              AGNIS (cold, low)
                   Hope ya like. What we done with
                   the place.

She opens the door, enters.       Stares down into the deep hole.
Unzips the bag, and...

...TIPS the ashes DOWN INTO the hole. Watch them in SLO-MO,
falling free. Hear the rustle of Agnis lifting her skirts, and...

CLOSE ANGLE on Agnis' face.       Staring out at the sea through a small
crack in the outhouse wall.       HEAR the splatter as she voids
herself.

                             AGNIS (a murmur)
                   Welcome home.

INT. WAVEY'S PARLOR - DAY

Daycare in progress. The comfy parlor has been given over to the
kids. A wall of Polaroids of each child faces a map of
Newfoundland with drawings of moose, caribou, and lobster. Little
Herry sits alone in a doorway, watching with big eyes as...

...Quoyle, Bunny astride his back, RAMPAGES around the parlor on
all fours, SNORTING like a crazed boar. The kids are squealing,
delighted, making excited little runs at him, swatting him with
throw pillows and rolled-up sweaters. Thrill of the hunt.

Wavey comes through the doorway, drying her hands, just behind
where her boy sits. Quoyle doesn't see her, he's thrashing and
bellowing, lost in the game. She watches, for a long beat. Then
leans down to Herry.

                               WAVEY (a whisper)
                   Go on.    Get the pig.

Herry grins like the devil. Dashes off to PLOW INTO the prey,
knocking them sprawling. Kids PILING on.

Wavey's unseen smile.       The start of something?

INT. WAVEY'S KITCHEN - LATER

CLOSE on Quoyle.     He is happily washing a mountain of dishes and
cups.

                             QUOYLE
                   So the Newfie drills another hole
                   in the ice, aways off from the first
                   one. Once again, the voice booms,
                   NO FISH DOWN HERE!

PULL BACK to see Wavey beside him.       She's drying what he washes.

                               QUOYLE

                 So he moves way down the ice.
                 Drills another hole. Voice comes
                 again, I SAID, NO FISH DOWN HERE!

They don't look at each other.      Poker-faced, just alike, working
side by side.

                           QUOYLE
                 The Newfie looks around. Still
                 nobody. Hollers, WHO ARE YA?
                 THE VOICE O' GOD? Voice comes
                 back, NO! THE ARENA MANAGER!

He can't help but snort out a chuckle of his own.       Sneaks a look
over at her, and she...

...laughs out loud.    Healthy.   Sexy, even.   But from the delay, he
guesses...

                           QUOYLE
                 Heard it before, huh?

She looks over at him.     Her eyes dance a little.

                           WAVEY
                 Sometimes, passion in performance.
                 Beats the element of surprise.

And he is lost in those eyes.     Knows it's showing.     Glances away to
where...

...Bunny sits in a corner.     Reading to a rapt Herry.

                           QUOYLE
                 You guys hungry?

                           BUNNY
                 Shhh. I'm teaching Herry to read.
                 Just like I did Warren.

                           QUOYLE
                 Is he learnin'?

Bunny looks over at him.     He is so dumb.

                           BUNNY
                 First is the teaching part.     The
                 learning comes later.

Herry nods.   Later.   And out of the blue...

                          BUNNY
                 Wavey? Now are the berries ready
                 to pick?

Quoyle looks over to the woman. But instead of Wavey, he sees
PETAL, staring at him with slow predatory heat.

                             PETAL
                   Want to pick my berries, do you.
                   Should I climb right up on this sink?

And then, once more she is...

                             WAVEY
                   Almost. Almost ready.       You know,
                   it's all about timing.

Quoyle.   Takes note.

INT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY

Quoyle alone in the office, pretending to peck away at a story.
Actually, he's looking...

...through the window. Where Jack Buggit, Tert Card, Billy Pretty
and Nutbeem are all circling around a small, roughly-made boat,
attached to its rented trailer. They are talking to each other in
learned tones. A Talmudic chat. And...

...in they come.     First through the door...

                             CARD
                   That's yer boat.

                             QUOYLE
                   Said it was.

                             CARD
                   One question remains.     Why.
                   Is that. Yer boat?

Uh-oh. He looks from one face to another. Even Billy is
irritated. Nutbeem gazes down, embarrassed for him.

                              QUOYLE
                   Well.   A boat's a boa...

                             CARD
                   It's a shit boat. Best thing,
                   get rid of it some dark night.

Quoyle can't believe this.      Hot shame burns.

                             BILLY
                   Go hire Alvin Yark to build ya a
                   sweet little rodney. This thing's
                   a wallowing cockeyed bastard that'll
                   sink in a bathtub.

And standing in the doorway, the scariest sight of all.    The boss.
Just shaking his head.

                              JACK (sadly)

                 You don't have the sense God gave
                 a doughnut, do ya?

The word from Sinai on Quoyle's worth.       A pity.

                           JACK
                 I'm goin' fishin'.

Out the door with a SLAMM!      Quoyle stares hopelessly after him.

                           NUTBEEM
                 Don't jump off a bridge over it.
                 Anyone can make a brainless, asinine,
                 devastatingly revealing blunder.

                              QUOYLE (actually means this)
                 Thanks.

                           CARD
                 What in th' furry pit of Newfie hell.
                 Is this!?

Holds up some sheets of paper.       Photos of the Melvilles'
botterjacht. Reads...

                           CARD
                 Hitler's Barge...?

                           QUOYLE
                 That goes with the shipping news.
                 Profile of a vessel in port.

                           CARD
                 What about the car accident?

                           QUOYLE
                 That's the one I didn't do. Mrs.
                 Diddolate sprained her wrist. Period.

Card still reading.

                           CARD
                 So you didn't do the one Jack told
                 yer to do, and you did one he don't
                 know yer did!

Silence.

                           QUOYLE
                 Pretty mu...

                              CARD
                 This copy.     Is worse.   Than yer boat.

He looks up.   Equal parts disgust and delight.

                              CARD

                 Jack even sniffs this, he cuts you
                 up fer lobster bait. I've half a
                 mind to run it.

Quoyle straightens his spine.

                            QUOYLE
                 Run it.

Strides off for the door.     Turns back...

                           QUOYLE
                 As for the part about you havin'
                 half a mind? No comment.

Out the door.   SLAMM harder than Jack's.

EXT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY

Quoyle stumbling toward his wagon with vacant eyes.

                           QUOYLE (V.O.)
                 Headline. Reporter Disembowels
                 Self With Rusty Joke.

EXT. GREEN HOUSE ROOF - DAY

Quoyle in a carpenter's belt, climbing very carefully from a ladder
onto the roof. His vertigo apparent as he keeps to his hands and
knees, trying to fight the compulsion to look down. Gives in to
it, peering from the corner of his eye down the cliff, the rocks,
the sea so far below. Not a good 1dea.

Comes to the shingles. Eases his way into a fearful crouch.   Okay.
Starts hammering. And rehearsing.

                           QUOYLE
                 Jack, I completely understand, I
                 would fire me, too.

Nodding, in time to the hammer strokes.

                           QUOYLE
                 In a heartbeat.

Hammers LOUDER, speaking in rhythm...

                           QUOYLE
                 You give me a chance, and what
                 happens? I buy the wrong boat,
                 I write the wrong story, I am the
                 lowest form of alleged life. In
                 fact, your comment...

Stops.

                            QUOYLE

                ...was an insult to the doughnut.

Hear now what the hammering had masked. Someone is reaching the
top of the ladder, climbing onto the roof.

Bunny. Somehow she has managed to climb while carrying a sandwich
on a plate. And an open bottle of soda. He stares at her,
uncomprehending.

                          BUNNY
                Egg salad and Nehi grape.

She sets them down.     Stands UP on the steep pitch.

                             QUOYLE (shocked stupid)
                Baby...

                          BUNNY
                They're mine but I'll share.

As the plate and bottle slip neatly OFF the roof and, after a
noticeable beat, shatter softly far below. Bunny's turn to be
shocked. She's contemplating going after them.

                          QUOYLE
                DON'T MOVE!!

Okay, that was a little loud. It has also scared the kid out of
her wits. Quoyle regrets this. Starts scooching awkwardly down
the slope, inches at a time...

                          QUOYLE (too casual)
                We're gonna play Wait For Daddy.
                Can you play that?

She's just staring over the side. Hypnotized by the sight.        He's
slipping toward her. Toward the edge.

                          QUOYLE
                And if you don't move.     Until I
                get there. Then...

Closer, reaching toward her back...

                          QUOYLE
                ...then you win!

...GRABS her arm, she STARTLES, violently LURCHING, but he YANKS
her to him. Holds her to his heart. Holds her. He is breathing
like a freight train.

                             QUOYLE
                That.     Was so easy.

INT. GAMMY BIRD - MORNING

Jack Buggit enters with energy.     Looks around.    Billy's typing,

Nutbeem's reading. Quoyle is cleaning out his desk, pulling things
off his little shelf to pack away. Goofy photo of Bunny. Ceramic
child-made three-legged turtle. Tiny padded box with what looks to
be carefully-preserved empty eggshells.

Jack heads toward him.

                          CARD
                Did ya see the Hitler's barge
                piece, Jocko?

                          JACK
                I saw it. And heard from some
                who'd done the same.
                      (to Quoyle)
                Good. Neatness.

Quoyle turns. Pretty much all his possessions are in a big
cardboard box. Jack peers into it.

                          JACK
                Reorganize. Start over.      Good
                thinking.

But he's smiling.   Like he's got the point.

                          QUOYLE
                Thing about the barge piece? I
                just thought it'd perk up th...

                          JACK
                Got six phone calls 'bout that
                piece. Six. That'd be like half
                a million calls in Toronto.

Grasps Quoyle around the back of the neck.

                          JACK
                People liked it, old son. Crowd
                went down to the dock t'see the
                thing, but it'd already pulled out.

Quoyle stares, slack-faced into the elfin eyes...

                          JACK
                Course you don't know anything
                about boats, but that's entertaining,
                too. So go ahead with it. That's
                the kinda stuff I want, see?

Just now, Card's jaw is scraping his boot tops.

                          JACK
                From now on, you write a column every
                week. The Shipping News. Gonna order
                you a computer and everything. And
                y'know the beauty part...?

Quoyle doesn't.

                            JACK
                  I don't have to tell Card all
                  over again, cause he's already
                  eavesdroppin'. So I'm free to
                  take m'leave.

                            QUOYLE
                  Goin' fishin'?

                            JACK
                  Ah. You've an instinct for character
                  and idiosyncrasy, old son.

A wink.   He heads toward the door.    And never looking at him...

                            JACK
                  Zip yer fly, Card.

Card looks down. He zips up, as the door slams. Billy Pretty
sends Quoyle a thumbs-up, without turning. Nutbeem clasps his
hands above his head, like a winning prizefighter.

Quoyle slides a sheet of paper into his typewriter.         Stares at it.

                            QUOYLE (V.O.)
                  Thirty-eight years. First time
                  anybody said you done it right.

INT. AGNIS' SHOP - DAY

A woman looks up from her stitching. She is solidly built, pushing
60, Emily Dickinson hair. A cheerful, calmly butch way about her.
Trustworthy eyes.

                            AGNIS
                  Nephew, this is Mavis Bangs.     A real
                  professional.

Mavis holds out a hearty hand. Agnis is showing him the shop. A
cutting table, two sewing stations. Billowing sailcloth hung over
the windows. Racks of leathers and fabrics.

                            AGNIS
                  And this is Dawn Budgel.   She's a
                  vegetarian.

Dawn, once described by Agnis as young and on the sexy side, is
that. Red lipstick and nails. Her eyes float up in a way that
suggests reflexive sensuality. Agnis nods to her, and the girl
reaches a slender pale hand...

                            DAWN
                  Agnis is always saying such...things
                  about you. It's nice to fit a man.

                  With the name.

And as she releases his hand, her eyes flick to Agnis. Some
conspiracy there. Quoyle follows his aunt back to the big cutting
table.

                            QUOYLE
                  I just, uh, came to see if you'd
                  heard abou..

                            AGNIS
                  Silver Melville?    Snuck off in the
                  night, they did.    Not a penny paid
                  for all we done.

Shows him sheets of baby blue leather.

                            AGNIS
                  We'd installed the banquettes in
                  her salon. Three of the chairs done
                  and delivered, three to go...

Points to them.    A neat row by the makeshift kitchenette.

                              QUOYLE
                  That's.    That's just terrible.

But Agnis is thinking...

                              AGNIS
                  Strange.    Leavin' the chairs.

And as he glances off, he sees Dawn across the way.      Her skirt
hiked up, as if she were adjusting a stocking.

She isn't wearing any.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

Billowy clouds frame a languid KITE, silver and sleek, darting this
way and that. Graceful, in command of the currents.

                            WAVEY (O.S.)
                  HERRY PROWSE! LOOK HOW WELL YOUR
                  KITE IS DOING!

See her now, seated atop a grassy slope. It is she who holds the
string, and her boy is way down at the bottom of the hill with
Bunny. Blue jumper billowing, the girl is teaching him how to make
necklaces from wildflowers and garbage bag twisty-ties. Herry and
the naked Barbies watch with great attention. The learning will
come later.

                            WAVEY
                  ARE YOU MAKING IT DANCE WITH
                  YOUR THOUGHTS?

On this he looks up.     Serious.

                            WAVEY
                  KEEP THINKING YOUR THOUGHTS!
                  YOUR KITE IS DOING SO MUCH BETTER
                  THAN MR. QUOYLE'S!

PULL BACK slightly to reveal that Quoyle has been sitting right
beside her all along. He holds the string of a big, glum kite that
hangs motionless in space with barely a flutter. As she watches
the kids, he stares at her, fixedly deciding whether to ask...

                            QUOYLE (barely audible)
                  Do you think Bunny's. Strange?

Wavey looks over.     Sees that he's worried half to death.

                            QUOYLE
                  In New York. They said she had a...
                  personality disorder.

                            WAVEY (softly)
                  And it was named Petal.

Do you understand that?

                            QUOYLE
                  All these hallucin...

                            WAVEY
                  The White Dog. Sometimes with the
                  Skinny Ghost. Kids do things like
                  that, it's called imagination. Like
                  the necklaces.

The necklaces, yeh.     A thought that frightens him.

                            QUOYLE
                  You know how many she makes?

She does.

                            WAVEY
                  It's a skill, she's proud of it. And
                  she brings her dolls along. And she
                  looks good in blue. And she wears a
                  key for a good luck charm.

Her kind smile.     No big deal.

                            QUOYLE
                  And she's saving her mother a room.
                  Did she tell you that?

Wavey's slow nod.

                             QUOYLE

                  She talks to her at night.        I can
                  hear through the door.

Very quiet now.    The wind.     The kites.

                            QUOYLE
                  You know how kids think.       You have
                  all those books.

                            WAVEY
                  The ones I read to teach Herry.
                  They don't make me an exp...

                               QUOYLE (blurting)
                  Just.     Is she okay?

That was naked.    He swallows.

                               QUOYLE
                  I mean.     If you had to guess..

Too serious a subject.       Too good a woman.     For an easy lie.

                            WAVEY
                  That child is the only friend my son
                  ever had. So she's strange, you bet.

She swallows, too.    Her eyes are damp.

                            WAVEY
                  I love that little girl. And I will
                  see to it. That she's all right.

Hold the look.

                            WAVEY
                  And I don't have to guess about it.

EXT. WOODS - LATER

Quoyle RUNNING, huffing, through a bog with every color of berries
imaginable. Around another bend in the path. Stops. Hands on his
knees.

Listens.   Nothing.   Shit.

                            QUOYLE
                  IF YOU GUYS AREN'T CHASING ME, I'M
                  GONNA BE COMPLETELY CHEESED OFF!

More nothing. He trudges back the way he came.              Peeks around a
bend to see...

...Bunny is teaching Berry to pick gooseberries. This time, the
learning has started. They are being very careful.

                               QUOYLE

                   If you pick enough, we can sell 'em
                   for a thousand dollars. And give it
                   to Aunt Agnis to make up for those
                   Staties who didn't pay h...

                             BUNNY (means business)
                   Then don't. Slow us. Down.

Quoyle SLAPS his hands across his mouth.         Sorry!     He tiptoes off.
Rounds a bend. Walking faster now...

Around another bend. And stops.         Hold on his face.      REVERSE ANGLE
to take his view of...

...Petal, kneeling in a flimsy sundress, picking berries.
Barefoot, her skirt hiked up, stained with berry juice. And when
she turns to him...

...she is still Petal. Her face is beautiful, and filled with
tender desire. She looks at him the way he has always dreamed she
would. He goes to...

...kneel beside her.       Touch her waist.    And now she is...

...another woman. His hand is on Wavey's waist, and it comes
slowly away. But her eyes are locked to his. Making her choice.

                               WAVEY (very soft)
                   Look.    I like you.

Even in kindness, he can smell rejection.          He starts to back away,
but she takes his hand. Holds it.

                                WAVEY
                   I want us.     To be friends, okay?

He nods, dumbly.     Of course.     Okay.

                             WAVEY
                   And friends. Need.       To understand
                   each other.

                             QUOYLE (so sorry)
                   I understand. Believe m...

                             WAVEY
                   My husband drowned.      Herry was...

Hard for her.   He quiets.

                             WAVEY
                   He was two months old. And Herold
                   took the boat out. Overnight. To
                   fish for haddock.

Do you understand?

                           WAVEY
                 Because I liked.     Haddock.

Silence.

                           WAVEY
                 It's four years.

She stares in his eyes.

                           WAVEY
                 And it's yesterday.

No smile.

                           WAVEY
                 Now, did I blow it.     Or can you
                 still be my friend?

A beat. Quoyle nods, sure. I'll be your friend. But what she
sees is a lifetime of being Quoyle washing past his eyes. It makes
her murmur...

                             WAVEY
                 What?    What are you thinking?

And from his heart...

                           QUOYLE
                 I'm thinking I'm sorry.     For
                 everything.

He stands up.   HEAR him stumble off.     HOLD on her.

EXT. GREEN HILLSIDE - DAY

A grassy place above an empty sea.      The rest of the world far away.
Two figures climb the gentle hill.

                           BILLY
                 How're you doin' with the Tall
                 and Quiet Woman?

                           QUOYLE
                 Cindy Crawford and me is doin' fine.

                           BILLY
                 I meant Wavey Prowse.

Oh.

                           BILLY
                 My dad used to say there's four
                 women in every man's life. The
                 Stouthearted Woman...

                             QUOYLE

                 Oh, that'd be Agnis.

                           BILLY
                 ...the Maid in the Meadow...

                           QUOYLE (has to think)
                 Bunny I guess. Weavin' a daisy-chain
                 necklace.

                           BILLY
                 ...the Tall and Quiet Woman...

                          QUOYLE
                 Well. She does have that posture
                 goin'.

                           BILLY
                 ...and the Demon Lover.

On this. Quoyle's smile fades. He looks away. They've reached a
fence where blunt pickets enclose crosses and wooden markers, many
fallen on the ground.

                           BILLY (wistful)
                 Me dad said that.

Billy finds the right marker. Sets his satchel onto the grass.
Kneels. His old fingers clear debris from painted words:
W. PRETTY. 1897 - 1944. THROUGH THE GREAT STORMS OF LIFE, HE
DID HIS BEST. GOD GRANT HIM ETERNAL REST.

                           BILLY
                 That's me poor father.     Thirteen
                 I was when he died.

He hears the thread of feeling in his simple words. And says no
more. Withdraws two cans of paint from his bag. One white, one
black. Two brushes. Lays them out carefully, for this task is
sacred.

                            BILLY
                 Every time I wonder.     Is this the
                 last coat?

Pries the lid off the tin of black.     And when he sees Quoyle's
eyes...

                            BILLY
                 Well, there's no one else to do
                 it, y'see.

                           QUOYLE (straight back)
                 There is now.

An easy smile.   Stating the obvious.

                           QUOYLE

                There's me.

The old man's face just stops.     The eyes sharpen.   Into a question.

                          QUOYLE
                Well, you said. There's no
                one else.

As if that were enough.

                         QUOYLE
                Hey. If you wanna rest next to
                him. I'll paint yours at the same
                time. No extra trouble.

Billy stares at him.     Stares at him.   Clears his throat, gruffly.

                          BILLY
                Then better get Alvin Yark.
                T'build yer a real boat. So
                yer'll be around.

EXT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY

Quoyle exits the house, pulling on his jacket, and...

...stops. Something laid across his threshold. A long piece of
TWINE has been placed there. KNOTS tied evenly along its length.
He glances back up to the second floor, thinking Bunny. Looks at
the thing again. Neat work. Odd. Slips it in his pocket.

EXT. CLIFFSIDE - DAY

Quoyle now making his way down a steep primitive trail through lush
vegetation. The green house is far above him. The shimmering bay
now just below. This way down as treacherous as it is wondrous,
and Quoyle SLIPS in the tangle and wet, half-slides through wild
angelica stalks and patches of dogberry, suddenly...

...LOSING his balance, TUMBLING roughly down a stretch, rolling,
grasping a spruce trunk. Pulling himself to his feet, he hears...
RUSTLING. Looks up, just as...

...a WHITE DOG appears through the bushes. Red eyes. Lips curled
back. A frozen second of mutual indecision, and Quoyle...

...SCREAMS and falls on his butt.     The dog...

...TAKES OFF, bounding down a path we hadn't noticed. Toward an
upright SILHOUETTE. Who steps into sun just long enough to
become...

...a MAN, grizzled and scrawny and quick.      Gone in a flash.   Like a
skinny ghost. And there, on his butt...

...Quoyle laughs softly.     How 'bout that?   Murmurs...

                           QUOYLE
                 Attaway, girl. You're smarter'n all
                 of us.

As he climbs to his feet, he sees the rocky beach just below.
Squints, as if at something that doesn't belong. We see it now...

...a SUITCASE, washed up onto a tangle of rocks, just offshore.

ANGLE...Quoyle wading into the water. Up to his knees, slips,
sinks to his waist. Stays upright. Snatches the suitcase from its
perch. Brings it back to shore, holding it high. Already, he is
making the face of someone smelling something he'd rather not.

He sets it down. The face is worse.     His curiosity running the
show, he unhooks the latch...

...and stops. Because he's staring inside. Suddenly, he SCREAMS
and FLAILS back, his leg STRIKING the case, and out tumbles onto
the wet ground...

...the head.   Of Bayonet Melville.

INT. SKIPPER WILL'S DINER - NIGHT

Three guys. Three beers. Five squidburgers (Quoyle likes his
backups ready and waiting).

                           CARD
                 Y'know none a that impresses Jack
                 Buggit. He's not one fer blatant
                 ambition.

Quoyle thinks better of his answer.    Chomps a bite instead.

                           NUTBEEM
                 Even if you don't recognize 'Human
                 Head Packed in Satchel' as the most
                 compelling piece ever to appear in...

                            CARD (snorts)
                 Even if.

below the table.

                 Point is. A real reporter woulda

                 named the obvious suspect.

                           QUOYLE
                 More obvious. Than the wife?

                           CARD
                 Yer aunt, ya thick Statie lardface
                 dumbass!

Quoyle.   And Nutbeem.   Just look at each other.

                           CARD
                 She gets stiffed by the guy, after
                 basin' her new shop on that revenue.
                 And she ain't one ta fool with.
                 Capable a anything, that woman!

                           QUOYLE (angry now)
                 Okay, where's the wife? Agnis kill
                 her too?

                           CARD
                 Okay, where's this week's shipping
                 news? Or you gonna rest on yer
                 Crisco-coated laurels.

Quoyle viciously BITES into his squidburger.

                           CARD
                 Uh-oh. The way he's chewin', he ain't
                 a fat boy t'be trifled with!

                              NUTBEEM (quietly)
                 His piece.     Is about oil tankers.

Card blinks.   Looks at Quoyle with, dare we say, new respect.

                           CARD
                 Hope fer ya yet. Now that's
                 news, the McGonigle oil field.

Scratches his crotch savagely.      To honor civilization.

                            CARD
                 That's why those with half a brain
                 already put our money where our
                 mouths is!

Puts his squidburger.    Where his mouth is.    Nutbeem clarifies for
Quoyle...

                           NUTBEEM
                 Two shares. Of Mobil.

INT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ANGLE...brightly lit kitchen. Bunny sits at the little table, a
large mixing bowl filled with popcorn before her, little Herry at
her side. They are watching Freakazoid on a tiny TV. Bunny
shovels in a mouthful of popcorn. Then makes a sage, if
unintelligible, comment about the show to Herry. Still chewing,
she takes another huge handful of popcorn...

...Herry opens his mouth like a baby bird. Bunny stuffs the snack
in. It's a stare-and-chew, side by side. Just alike.

ANGLE...cozy parlor. Quoyle sits in a Barca-lounger with a huge
bowl of chips in his lap. He is watching hockey on a modest TV,
the action is fierce. Stuffs his mouth full of chips, yet somehow
manages to say...

                           QUOYLE
                 ...so there they were, this goofy
                 old codger and his dog, big as life.

PULL BACK to see Wavey now. Curled on the sofa, under a lap robe.
She is knitting something in a heavy oxblood-colored wool. He
watches her work.

                           WAVEY (softly)
                 That'd be old Nolan. He's actually
                 your uncle, last of the crazy Quoyles.
                 I should have realized.

Keeps her eyes on her work.

                           WAVEY
                 Sad, really. Lives like a hermit
                 in a run-down shack. No one to
                 look after h...

                           QUOYLE
                 Here I was worried about Bunny night
                 and day, and there's absolutely
                 nothing wrong with her.

A silence.   Which makes him uneasy.

                           QUOYLE
                 Her only problem is her dad worries
                 too mu...

                           WAVEY (not looking up)
                 You are a loving and wonderful father.
                 You're not the problem.

She meant to reassure him.    Instead...

                           QUOYLE
                 So what is th...

                             WAVEY
                   Nice to see you.

Looks up with smoky eyes.

                             WAVEY
                   ...after all this time.

Oh.

                             QUOYLE
                   Well. I've been workin' longer hours.
                   So Dennis and Beety were kind enough
                   to bring Bunny to the daycare. Fed
                   her a lotta meals, too. They're real
                   friends.

Quoyle's smile tries to sell the innocence of his absence.

                             WAVEY (very quiet)
                   I thought you forgot. That I'm your
                   friend, too.

No smile from her. She wants him to know she was hurt.           He shakes
his head, serious now. No, I didn't forget.

                             WAVEY
                   You want another sandwich?    There's
                   roast pork.

He holds up what's left of his four-decker.          This is plenty.   Takes
a huge bite to show how much he likes it.

                               WAVEY
                   You said.    You'd read me your
                   article.

He did, he nods.     But just now he's scared to. And so she smiles.
Which traps him.     He pulls out a single sheet of paper. Clears his
throat.

                             QUOYLE
                   Nobody Hangs a Picture of an Oil
                   Tanker. That's the header.

She nods. Likes that. He gestures, go back to your knitting.             So
she smiles, slyly. And commences to knit.

                             QUOYLE (reads)
                   There's a 1904 photo hung in the
                   library. Eight schooners heading
                   out to fishing grounds, sails spread
                   it like white wings. Beautiful. Beyond
                   compare.

This means something to him.       Hear it in his voice.

                            QUOYLE (reads)
                  More common today is the low black
                  profile of oil tankers. Like the
                  ruptured Golden Goose, which last
                  week bled 14,000 tons of crude onto
                  seabirds, fish and boats at Cape
                  Despond.

He stops.    As if revisiting that little thought in his mind.

                            QUOYLE (reads)
                  There will be more and more tankers.
                  They will grow old and corroded, and
                  their tanks will split. They have
                  already done to fishing. What their
                  spill has done to fish.

He sneaks a glance.       She has never looked up.

                            QUOYLE (reads)
                  Nobody hangs a picture of an oil
                  tanker. On their wall.

Silence.    A full one.

                               QUOYLE
                  Well.     Whatcha think?

She reflects.

                            WAVEY
                  I think when Card sees it, he'll
                  split a gut. I think he'll sit up
                  nights thinking of cheap shots to pay
                  you back. I think he'll never stop
                  until you're fired.

Quoyle keeps nodding at each point.          Yep.   Yep.

                            WAVEY
                  I think I haven't been so proud. Of
                  a friend. Since I don't know when.

Quoyle's heart explodes in his chest.          And shines in his eyes.
There is a long silence.

                            WAVEY (softly)
                  Maybe another sandwich. There's
                  roast pork.

He swallows.    He just doesn't want to cry from happiness.

                            QUOYLE
                  Well, sure.

INT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY

CLOSE on Card. Who is RIPPING the single page in half. Then
again. And again. And again. See Quoyle now, standing at the
desk like a statue. Billy and Nutbeem at their stations, watching
as Card...

...flutters the pieces down onto his desk.       Like falling snow.

                            CARD
                  Oh, I'll run it. Just easier
                  t'copy edit. When yer can move
                  th'pieces around.

A hush.    A frozen tableau in this room.

                             QUOYLE
                  Run it.   Like I wrote it.

                            CARD
                  How does this suit yer, Quoyle?
                  I'll do my job. You do yers, which
                  means a four-vehicle pile-up south
                  a Killick-Claw. And don't ferget
                  the camera.

He slides the battered camera across the desk. They glare at each
other a full beat. Card belches, softly. Quoyle takes the camera,
heads for the door...

                            CARD
                  I fergot somethin'.

Quoyle turns.    Card doesn't.

                            CARD
                  You pinko Greepeace sack a quivering
                  pigfat.

Thinks.

                            CARD
                  Did I leave out moosebutt-ugly?
                      (nods to himself)
                  You may go.

HOLD on him.    Making a neat little pile of the torn pieces.

                            QUOYLE (O.S.)
                  Like I wrote it.

SLAMM! Across the room, Nutbeem stands.        Takes his cigarettes.
Passing Card's desk, on the way out...

                            NUTBEEM
                  Tough love. Impressive.

SLAMM!    Card shoots Billy a challenging look.     You got something to
say?

                           BILLY
                 I hope you get him fired.

Do you.

                           BILLY
                 So I can watch him beat yer to jelly.

Just turns around.     Flicks ON his computer.   Back to work.

EXT. GREEN HOUSE - TWILIGHT

Bunny jumping out of the wagon, running to the house.      As Quoyle
locks his car...

                           BUNNY (O.S.)
                 Why'd you leave the house open?

He looks up.   She is pushing the front door with one finger.     It
swings OPEN.

                           BUNNY
                 Can I keep the necklace?

...and lifts a long piece of TWINE. There are KNOTS neatly tied
along its length. Quoyle stares. Stares.

                              QUOYLE (calm)
                 Sweetie.     Come sit in the car.

INT. FRONT HALLWAY - TWILIGHT

Quoyle climbing the stairs in fading light. He carries a tire
iron. Stops midway. Listens to the silence.

                           QUOYLE
                 IF ANYBODY'S THERE, YOU BETTER COME
                 OUT NOW!

Up, up, to the top.     Looking down the empty hall to see...

...knotted twine.     At every door.

INT. GAMMY BIRD - EARLY MORNING

Quoyle enters, haggard and distracted. The place is lit, but
empty. A toilet FLUSHES. From the loo, appears...

                              CARD
                 S'tell me.     Yer fancy it?

Nodding toward something behind Quoyle. Turning, we see that
hanging over Card's desk is an oversized framed photo of: QUIET
EYE - WORLD'S LARGEST OIL TANKER. Quoyle stares blankly.

                              QUOYLE

                   Like I said.    Nobody hangs those.

Card just goes to the fresh stack of newspapers on his desk.       Hands
one toward Quoyle...

                             CARD
                   Yer column's front page stuff. Only
                   now, it's more like a caption, is all.

A photo of the same tanker.       That hangs on Card's wall.

                             QUOYLE (reads)
                   More than 3000 tankers proudly ride
                   the world's seas. Even the biggest
                   take advantage of Newfoundland's deep-
                   water ports and refineries.

                             CARD

                   ham and eggs, and like ham and eggs
                   they'll nourish us in the coming

                   Even put yer name on it.

                             QUOYLE (finishes reading)
                   Let's all hang a picture of an oil
                   tanker. On our wall.

Stares at the paper.     In his hand.

                             CARD
                   Man a yer principles. I unnerstan'
                   resignation is th'only honorable
                   course.

Quoyle looks up.     Card flinches back.    But all that comes is...

                             QUOYLE
                   How can a man resign.    To nobody?

Drops the paper on the floor.       Steps on it, on his way toward the
door.

                             CARD
                   If yer off to see Jack Buggit,
                   yer'll hafta swim some.

Quoyle turns back.

                             CARD
                   Yer can whine an' beg t'him.     But I

                 runs his paper, every inch of it,
                 every dirty time-eatin' job which he
                 would have t'do without me.

A wink.

                 you over fishin'...yer not as smart as

The cackle of the guy holding the straight flush.

                           CARD
                 Me an' Jack. Has a sym-bi-otic
                 relationship. Yer can look that up.

Quoyle puts his hand on the door.

                           QUOYLE
                 I know the word, Card. It means
                 you two deserve each other.

Out the door.   It closes behind him.    Card alone, crosses his arms
in glee...

                           CARD
                 I'LL TELL JACK YER SAID SO!

HOLD on Card.   DISSOLVE TO...

INT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY

CLOSE on a box of assorted doughnuts. Two dozen. A hand reaches
down toward a raspberry swirl, thinks better of it, moves
thoughtfully along the selection to pluck a maple glaze, and bring
it to...

...Quoyle's mouth. The box rests beside the cardboard carton into
which Quoyle is packing his things. Nutbeem sits on the edge of
the desk, nibbling a cruller. Billy is bringing three mugs of
coffee. Looks like a going-away party. Through the glass of the
only private office...

...Jack Buggit is talking. Card is not. Card stands now, strides
to the door, flings it OPEN. Nutbeem taps Quoyle's shoulder with
his pastry. They look to...

                             CARD
                 So.    This is what Jack and I think.

He's looking straight in Quoyle's eyes.     Defiant as ever.

                           CARD
                 We wanna run Quoyle's oil spill
                 piece b'cause controversy sells
                 papers and papers sells ads.

                            NUTBEEM
                  Sounds reasonable to me.

Lives to needle this guy.     Card keeps his laser gaze on Quoyle.

                            CARD
                  And we're gonna let Quoyle have
                  his head on these columns, up to
                  500 words. So he'll get his
                  confidence up.

                            NUTBEEM
                  Well, let's not go overboard.    He's
                  rather green doncha thi...

                            CARD
                  But we wanna expand his responsi-
                  bilities to boat crashes. There's
                  maybe four a week.

                            NUTBEEM
                  He'll need a raise. And need to be
                  represented in the negotia...

                             CARD
                  And.   The oil tanker picture.   Stays!

Nutbeem's eyes WIDEN. He mimes catching an arrow shot through his
chest. Falls OFF the desk.

                            CARD (to Quoyle)
                  All that clear?

Quoyle looks him in the eyes.     Starts putting his things back in
his desk.

                            CARD
                  One more thing...

Hear the SLAMM!

                            QUOYLE (never looks up)
                  Jack's gone fishing?

EXT. OMALOOR BAY - DAY

The sky threatens black. Quoyle picks his way across the rocks to
his ungainly, much-maligned boat, as it bobs against the weathered
dock. He crouches, and as he begins to untie it, his gaze drifts
out toward the nearby point, and...

...something catches his eye. A boulder in the shape of a great
dog. And as he stares, there is something below it. Something in
a cove protected from intrusion by a jagged ring of menacing
rocks...

...it is a MAN in a yellow suit. His head under the surface as if
looking for fish. Arms and legs spread out like a starfish, the
body slides in and out of a small cave. Tugged by the sea like a
top on a string.

Quoyle stares in frozen shock.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                Headline. Reporter Becomes Magnet
                For Dead Men.

No way in past the pounding surf, the savage rocks.    So Quoyle
turns sharply. Squints across the bay.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                What was my panic? He was already
                dead. Maybe I thought, in some dim
                way...

CLIMBS into his boat, TURNS the engine over.    KICKS it in overdrive
toward the town across the bay.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                ...if it wasn't too late for him.
                It wouldn't be for Petal.

STREAKING out, toward the black sky.    Racing to open sea where the
chop INCREASES drastically. Closer.     Closer...

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                Once I was past the shelter of the
                lee shore, and into the real wind.
                I realized my mistake.

...clear of the point's protection, the wind ROCKS the tiny craft,
swells coming BROADSIDE. The boat RISES, then DROPS with cruel
speed. Quoyle tries to swing the boat around, the propeller RACES,
the bow PITCHES violently, SLAMMING down, the stern SWAMPED, the
hull filling, swerving broadside just as the oncoming sea HITS with
all its force, and the little boat...

...rolls OVER, Quoyle suddenly FLYING under water, limbs flailing
in all directions...

                            QUOYLE (V.O.)
                Headline.    Reporter Becomes Anchor
                Man.

INTERCUT...Quoyle's dad FLINGING him into the public pool, the
youngster SINKING like an anvil in a profusion of bubbles, and
CUT...

BACK to Quoyle, struggling madly somehow to the surface, THRASHING
toward the overturned boat, GRASPING the stilled propeller shaft,
which causes the bow to lift, the next wave turning the boat
upright, FILLING it with water, and it SINKS forever, as Quoyle...

...TUMBLES once more beneath the surface, watching the boat
DISAPPEAR into darkness below him.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                Stupid. Stupid to drown with Bunny
                so young. No life jacket, no floating
                oar. No sense.

Back to the surface, GASPING for air. And then, daintily rowing a
small boat, unaffected by the waves, her filmy dress rippling in
light breeze...

                          PETAL
                Look, it floats.     Just like you.

Is the lilting smile cruel?   Or only the irony that conveys
intimacy, even affection.

                          PETAL
                Maybe it's filled with fat.

And VANISHES. In her place, bobs a red BOX. A plastic beer
cooler. He LUNGES for it, GRIPPING the handles, resting his chest
on its top.

The waves RISE, mountainous now, and he rises and falls with them.
He has been swept a mile from the nearest shore.

INTERCUT...a winch pulling part of the Geo, streaming mud, from
swiftly flowing water. Police and bystanders gathered.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                And I wondered. Am I going where
                she's gone?

BACK to the bay. A barely-conscious Quoyle still clings somehow to
the plastic cooler. But hours have passed. Light is fading.

                          QUOYLE (V.O.)
                ...and will I see her?

He turns. And there she is. Beaming at him from the bow of her
little rowboat, a smile ambiguous in the growing dusk. It could be
love. From behind her a light GLOWS, giving Petal the aspect of an
angel.

She drops a wink.   FADES away.    And the light becomes...

...the BEAM from a fishing boat. Quoyle squints his swollen eyes,
as strong hands WRENCH him from his box. From the sea. A voice
warbles, distorted by wind and Quoyle's diminished consciousness...

                          JACK
                Jesus Cockadoodle Christ!     I knowed
                somebody was out here.

Quoyle's teeth are chattering so hard, his body shivering so

painfully, Buggit hauls him over the rail and lays him down on a
wriggling mound of fish.

                           JACK
                 Thank god fer yer figure, me old son.
                 A thin man woulda froze.

Quoyle burrows into the fish, like nestling in a down comforter.
Jack covers him with a heavy tarp. Crouches down close...

                            JACK
                 Good.   Yer lost th'boat.

INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Dim light. Quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet.   His
eyes flutter. Open. Where...?

                           VOICE (O.S., very soft)
                 It's all right. You're in heaven.

His head SNAPS around. She's sitting just beside the bed in half-
shadow. Her oxblood knitting across her lap.

                             WAVEY
                 Actually.    It's just my bed.

Now he sees the cigarette.

                           WAVEY
                 Actually, it's not. I just wanted
                 to see your eyes bug out like that.

Now he sees the smile.

                           QUOYLE
                 You don't smoke.

His voice was a croak. So he CLEARS his throat with a massive and
disgusting effort. It is gross and funny, and she smiles again.

                           WAVEY
                 Only when I'm worried.      I don't
                 worry much.

He rolls over, to see her better.      They are very close.

                           QUOYLE
                 You don't have to, I'm all right.
                 I'm in heaven.

                           WAVEY
                 I'm not worried.    About you.

Oh.   As he draws a breath to ask...

                             WAVEY

                   You're in the boys' room at Jack's
                   house. Wonder how long since Dennis
                   slept here.

She glances to the nightstand. Beneath the dim lamp.       A picture of
Jack and blond son Jesson. Guess what they're doing.

                             WAVEY
                   Mrs. Buggit called, knew Bunny was
                   still with me. The kids are camped
                   out in the parlor.

A beat.

                              QUOYLE
                   Nice.   You sittin' up with me.

A longer one.

                             WAVEY
                   S'okay. Someday you'll do somethin'
                   nice for me.

He nods.   He will.

                             QUOYLE
                   Who you worried ab...

                             WAVEY
                   You didn't find a second dead man.
                   Just the rest of the first one.

Ah.   He nods.   Well, that figures.

                              QUOYLE
                   I asked.   Who you worried about?

On this, she stubs out her cigarette.      Takes another from the pack.

                             WAVEY
                   You said Bunny talks to Petal at
                   night. You ever listen?

He shakes his head.

                             QUOYLE
                   Not really. Wouldn't be right.

                             WAVEY
                   Well, I'm not that nice a person.

STRIKES a match.

                             WAVEY
                   She plays Petal. Talks to the
                   Barbies, like Petal talking to her.

Brings her cigarette.   To the flame.

                          WAVEY
                She says she's sorry she left them.
                It was just to see if they could be
                good girls. And they were...

And.

                          WAVEY
                ...and she loves them.

His eyes at once rapt and suffering.     She watches that.

                          WAVEY
                The Barbies look better naked, Bunny
                looks good in blue, guess who said
                that?

Draws on her smoke.

                          WAVEY
                So we talked. Just before Petal
                left her with that...stranger? Bunny
                had snapped her mom's bead necklace.
                That's why she's making more.

Do you understand?

                          WAVEY
                When she's made enough.     She'll
                be forgiven.

Tears are pooling in his eyes.   Hers, too.     She keeps going...

                          WAVEY
                She saves Petal a room at the house,
                but she's also got the key to the old
                place. In case her mom would rather
                go there.

A thin stream of air escapes from his lips.

                          QUOYLE
                And she talked about it.      Just like
                that.

                          WAVEY
                Sure, I lied. I said nice things
                about her mother.

Bitter smile.

                          WAVEY
                See, there's only one problem.
                Petal isn't gone.

Quoyle thinking.     Madly.   What can he do?

                             QUOYLE
                   So we're patient. And we wait, and
                   we're good to her.
                             (beat)
                   And. Maybe. Time.

She stares back.     Unease to match his own.   Maybe time.

INT. ALVIN YARK'S BOAT HOUSE - DAY

A wiry wisp of an aged elf, ALVIN YARK is shaping the center beam
of what will become a tidy boat. Its wooden skeleton across two
sawhorses in his spacious workshop.

                             ALVIN (sings softly to himself)
                   Oh, the Gandy Goose, it ain't no use.
                   It ain't no use, the Gandy Goose.

Quoyle, Wavey and Dennis stand in a row. Watching the little
artisan shave wood as if his tools were his hands.

                             ALVIN (keeps singing, as if alone)
                   The Gandy Goose, she ain't no uuuuse...
                   Cause all her nuts'n bolts is loose.

Wavey can't help but smile.      She really likes the old duck.

                             ALVIN (never turning)
                   See, I'm already buildin' yers in me
                   mind. The singin' helps that. But.
                   Gotta take a walk in the woods, find a
                   spruce with jest th' right curve fer
                   yer stem.

And says no more. Keeps working. They are like acolytes at the
feet of a guru who never bothers even to glance their way.

                             QUOYLE
                   Well, hurry up. Thirty, forty years
                   I'll be rarin' to get back out on the
                   water.

Everyone smiles.     Except the guru.

                             ALVIN
                   Gotta build her solid. Who knows,
                   mebbe Jack Buggit'll give his fishin'
                   license to his boy. So next time,
                   won't be nobody to pull yer out.

                             DENNIS (real quiet)
                   Jack Buggit's boy is drowned.

Everyone looks.     Except the guru.

                             ALVIN (cheery)
                   Dennis. Y'hear the one about the
                   Newfie who lived ferever?

A beat.

                             DENNIS
                   No sir.

                             ALVIN
                   His kid never got a fishin' license.

Now he turns.     A maritime Yoda, squinting to discern if his message
is received.

                             ALVIN
                   What we wait fer? She's like
                   the main stem. Gives us our shape,
                   doncha see.

He runs his hand along the backbone of the boat he's building.

                             ALVIN
                   Death's one shape.     Fergiveness is
                   another.

Crinkly old eyes, laser bright.        Dennis isn't angry.       Just
resolved.

                             DENNIS
                   Thing 'bout waitin' on fergiveness?
                   Mixes up who's waitin' on who.

No smile, no spin.     Just the truth.

                             DENNIS
                   Death is simpler.     An' a lot shorter
                   wait.

In the silence.     A door opens.

                             MRS. YARK (O.S.)
                   Mr. Quoyle...?

A sprightly bird-like woman.        Wears apology and concern.

                             MRS. YARK
                   The school is callin'?     It's about
                   yer daughter?

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

The PRINCIPAL is spare, dressed for England, her voice
authoritarian by its pace, exaggerated diction, and lack of volume.

                             PRINCIPAL
                   ...not only pushed Mrs. Lumball.        Not

                  only pushed her very hard...

Seated in a semi-circle around the desk of power. Quoyle,
stricken, respectful. Wavey, already pissed off at the principal.
And Bunny,her hat and coat on, arms folded, face crimson and set.

                            PRINCIPAL
                  She knocked. Her down.

Do you understand the severity of this, Mr.       Quoyle?

                             PRINCIPAL
                  And. Refuses to explain her act.      Or.
                  Apologize.

Is that right, young lady?

                            PRINCIPAL
                  Under the circumstances.     We have no
                  choice but to suspend.

Bunny looks down.    Glaring an evil spell of death at her own
kneecaps.

                            WAVEY (quietly)
                  I think Bunny and I. Should take
                  a walk.

And stands.

                            QUOYLE
                  Uh. Wavey? If it's all the same
                  to you...

EXT. PATH - DAY

Quoyle and Bunny alone, hand-in-hand, walking slow where they once
picked berries. Nobody's talking.

                            BUNNY
                  When you gonna ask?

                            QUOYLE (calm)
                  When you're in the mood.

Apparently, that hasn't happened yet.      More walking.

                            QUOYLE
                  She musta done something.     Really bad.

Said like he means it.    Which he does.     And Bunny, squinting up,
sees that.

INTERCUT...the crime. Playground filled with kids. Bunny and
girlfriends on the jungle gym. Bunny the best, a natural jock.
MRS. LUMBULL large, sour, doughy, and betrayed by life, stands with
her silver whistle in the midst of chaos. Her thoughts on a higher

plane.

                          BUNNY (O.S.)
                She's the worst one of all!

Little Herry Prowse comes to tug at the teacher's wool coat. He is
holding his crotch and jumping up and down. This does not require
an advanced credential to interpret.

                          BUNNY (O.S.)
                Herry told her he had to pee. But
                the way he talks. He could just
                say 'eeee,' like that.

Mrs. Lumbull looks down. From her face as she responds, she has
already devoted, over time, more professional attention to this
troublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator.

                          BUNNY (O.S.)
                She told him that recess was almost
                over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip
                special, an' he could hold it.

Herry, seemingly, disagrees. Still holding his crotch, he jumps up
and down with greater agitation. She grabs him, rather roughly, by
the arm. Marches him over to...

                          BUNNY (O.S.)
                She made him stand against the wall.

...and walks off, pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away. He
screams, pumping his fists in frustration. Grabs himself,
suddenly. Whether or not we can see the dampness spread, we can
see his humiliation all too clearly. As his tears come...

...a figure BOLTS into frame from behind Mrs. Lumbull. Hunched
over like a linebacker, full speed ahead, LAUNCHING herself into
the back of the large woman's knees. Her feet go UP, and the rest
of her goes...

...DOWN like the proverbial amount of bricks. Herry's tears stop
fast. Watching the woman shriek, and keep shrieking. Makes him
laugh. CUT...

BACK TO...the berry path.   They are sitting on a fallen log.

                          QUOYLE
                See, a good dad would say hitting
                is always wrong. You coulda hurt
                her bad. I guess you know that.

                          BUNNY
                She wasn't hurt for real.     Just
                screamed like a baby.

Quoyle pulls out a single Snickers bar.

                             QUOYLE
                   Wish I'd seen it.     It really sounds
                   funny.

                             BUNNY
                   Petal'll think so, too.

He looks at her.      Nods, probably will.    Peels the candy bar free of
its wrapper.

                             QUOYLE
                   Well, there won't be any trouble at
                   school. I'II take care of that.

                              BUNNY
                   How?

He breaks the candy bar in half.        Tho not quite equally.

                             QUOYLE
                   Because the best thing about people.
                   Is they can forgive each other. I
                   heard that this morning.

                             BUNNY
                   That teacher. Is gonna forgive me?

He nods.   Oh, yeh.

                             QUOYLE
                   That. And she won't want the story
                   printed in the paper.

Oh.

                              BUNNY
                   Well.   I don't wanna forgive her.

                             QUOYLE
                   Me neither.

He holds out the two pieces of candy. She takes them both.         the
bigger one in his mouth. As he chews...

                             BUNNY
                   I had to do it. 'Cept for Wavey,
                   I'm the only family Herry's got.

She nibbles at her own piece.

                             BUNNY
                   Like the ghost.     Who's not a ghost.

Hmmn?

                             BUNNY
                   The one who ties the knots?     You're

                  the only family he's got.

Right?   Her father doesn't react.       He's even stopped chewing.

                              BUNNY
                  You said.

And slowly.    Quoyle nods.    I said.

EXT. NOLAN'S SHED - DAY

Quoyle picks his way down to the battered boat shed, hidden at the
foot of his cliff. He carries a big carton, which we see has made
the journey slow and awkward. Across the gravel now, to...

...the door. HEAR the fire crackling, see the smoke curling.
Takes a breath. Knocks softly. Then LOUDER.

                            QUOYLE
                  UNCLE NOLAN? CAN I COME IN?

No answer.    Juggle the box, lift the latch.      Enter...

INT. NOLAN'S SHED - NIGHT

The old man and the dog huddled together at the fire. They look
over with red eyes. Just alike. Only one growls. Quoyle finds a
smile, a soft voice...

                             QUOYLE
                  Uncle. My daughter Bunny and I.
                  We got you some hot bread. And some
                  meat. Some dried fish. Some squash
                  and vegetables...a cake...some warm
                  clothes...

Nolan is listening. Sharp-eared, sharp-eyed. What trick is this?
So Quoyle sets the carton down in the squalor. Takes out a loaf of
fresh bread. One step forward. Lay it down.

Good faith offering.    And...

...Nolan scuttles to it. Like a wary crab. He tears off a chunk
of bread. Nibbles. He likes it. And as he eats...

                            QUOYLE (softly)
                  You tied those knots, huh?
                  At my house?

...crouches down to the old man's size.        Almost close enough to
touch.

                            NOLAN
                  Ain't yer house, it's th' Ouoyle
                  house!

He's found the meat.    Ripped off a chunk.

                           QUOYLE
                 See, I am Qu...

                           NOLAN
                 Old ones. Got run outta Omaloor Bay a
                 hunnerd years ago. Dragged that house
                 across th' ice. On spruce runners.

Stuffs some into his face.      Like this, even better.

                           NOLAN
                 Hadda lash it to th' rock.     She'll
                 tell yer.

She.

                           NOLAN
                 Course she never come t'see me.
                 That's obvious why.

And as Quoyle draws a breath to ask...

                           NOLAN
                 Your Aunt Agnis Hamm, me son. That's
                 cause she can't face me. I knows she
                 killed 'im.

A moment.   Of stone silence.

                              QUOYLE
                 Him.

                           NOLAN
                 That baby she was carryin'. What was
                 she t'do? She wuz only 12. An' it
                 was her own brother what done 'er.

Quoyle's wide-eyed shock.

                              QUOYLE (numb)
                 Her own...

INTERCUT...a tiny frozen pond. Long ago. A girl of 12, rawboned,
husky, skating alone. We've seen her, in the photo at Quoyle's
dad's house. And as she skates, she looks up to see...

...a boy of 15, stocky, sullen. He was in the same photo. Only
now, he steps onto the ice. Unbuttons his pants. Begins to slide
toward her on the soles of his fishing boots. She looks around.
Snow banked on all sides of the pond. Nowhere to run on her
skates.

                           NOLAN (O.S.)
                 Her brother, me son. She only
                 had th' one.

The girl, breathless, skating this way and that. The boy closing
in, cutting off her angle. A deadly endgame. There are no words.
And...

...he is ON her. Pulling her TUMBLING to the ice in SLO-MO.
No sound but their hot breath, the grunt of the struggle, and
CUT BACK to...

                           NOLAN
                 Course no one alive knows no more.
                 So her an' me...
                           (winks)
                 Our. Little. Secret.

INT.   AGNIS' NEW SHOP, KILLICK-CLAW - DAY

Agnis and Mavis are showing Wavey their new shop. It is big and
bright with more elaborate fittings, the amount of work piled up
carries the scent of success. Quoyle trails behind, as Agnis dotes
on Wavey like a prize new daughter-in-law. When she turns, she
sees her nephew staring...

                           AGNIS
                 What? My hem crooked?      As if
                 I was wearin' a hem.

He was staring pretty intently.    Realizes that.

                            QUOYLE
                 Naw, I just come from seein' your
                 cousin Nolan. Guess I was thinkin'
                 about him.

She holds his gaze with her own.    Is she wondering?

                           DAWN
                 Mr. Quoyle? What do you think of
                 my dress?

Everybody turns on that one. Mavis cuts her alter ego Agnis a
look. Can you believe this slut?

                           DAWN
                 I wore it just for you.

She actually looks pretty good in it.      Wavey noticing that.
Watching Quoyle say...

                            QUOYLE
                 That was more consideration.       Than
                 I deserve.

Polite banter? Or outright flirting? Hard to tell if it's Wavey
or Agnis who disapproves more. Dawn ignores them.

                           DAWN
                 Did your aunt tell you about all

                 the money?

Agnis just blinks.   Can scarcely believe she heard that.

                           DAWN
                 Agnis told us it came from Macau.

                           AGNIS (quietly)
                 Hush yoursel...

                           DAWN
                 ...from Silver Melville. And it
                 was more than she expected. And we
                 shipped the chairs off to her.
                 Y' know, the three remaining?

A really frozen beat.

                          QUOYLE (casual, to Agnis)
                 Uh. Why would she send you more
                 tha...

                           AGNIS (to Dawn)
                 Do you have enough attention now,
                 young lady?

                           DAWN
                 Yes, Ma'am, I think so.

Mavis echoes Agnis' glare.

                           QUOYLE (really casual)
                 Macau, huh? So. That where y'sent
                 th' chairs?

Agnis turns.   Sizes him up.

                           AGNIS
                 It's flatterin' you showin' me how
                 you've turned into such a competent
                 reporter and all. But even if I
                 remembered where I sent 'em. I
                 couldn't tell ya.

Puts her fingers to her lips.      Leans closer, to confide something
he is obviously unaware of...

                           AGNIS
                 Professional ethics.

INT. WAVEY'S KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

CLOSE on Wavey, cooking flapjacks.      Talking to them.

                              WAVEY
                 Only you.     Could do this.

And she's not pleased.

                            WAVEY
                  You fed him. You gave him clothes.
                  You're the first human ever was kind
                  to him...

She scoops them expertly into a stack.

                            WAVEY
                  Accordingly. You're sick with guilt.

Serves them to...

                            WAVEY
                  You sure you're not a complex guy?

...Quoyle, who nods absently. About the one thing he is sure of.
Just now, he's examining the prodigious status of her oxblood
knitting. Still attached to the needles, it looks too broad for
a muffler.

                            QUOYLE (decides)
                  Horse blanket.

                            WAVEY (ah!)
                  That's what that is!

A beat.   Another.

                            QUOYLE
                  So if y'called around.      Musta
                  found somepla...

                            WAVEY (quietly)
                  One decent golden age home. It's
                  in St. John's. You can maybe afford
                  it, tho God knows why you should.

She pushes the flapjacks closer to him, CLANKS down the fork, eat!
She's exasperated. Thinks he's wasting his money.

                            QUOYLE
                  I can't put him there, til I go
                  down to St. John's. See it's all
                  right.

                                WAVEY
                  Great!      Let's not be rash!

                            QUOYLE
                  Come with me.

And everything.      Sorta.    Stops.

                            QUOYLE
                  I mean, the kids could stay with

                 Dennis and Beety.       Or Agnis, or...

A meaningful beat.

                            WAVEY
                 Why.   Would I. Do that?

She looks deep in his eyes. Hard to guess the answer she wants to
hear. He clears his throat. Looks down.

                           QUOYLE
                 Well. Remember when you said.
                 Someday, I'd do something nice
                 for you?

And when he looks to her, she is...

                           PETAL (Wavey's voice)
                 And this is it.

A witheringly sexy smile.

                           QUOYLE
                 Hey. Overnight trip to St. John's.
                 All expenses paid.

Petal arches a delicate brow.

                              PETAL (Wavey's voice)
                 Overnight?

He blinks.   And sees...

                           WAVEY
                 What's wrong with a weekend?

With a playful smile.      Of her own.

EXT. DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, ST. JOHN'S - DAY

Not London, but it might as well be. Wavey and Quoyle atop a red
double-decker bus, wind whipping their hair. She is watching the
big city flow past, drinking every inch of it. He's watching her.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Wavey carries an armload of little girl's tights and corduroy
pants, picking through a bin of barrettes. Quoyle appears with a
fistful of neckties. Holds them up hopefully to his chest one at a
time, each more breathtakingly godawful than the last. Well? She
SHIVERS with disgust. Lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser-
vative one she's already picked for him. He SHIVERS, just as she
did. They share the trace of a grin, just alike. He walks off.

...Wavey trying on furry hats in a full-length mirror, as Quoyle
keeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful. She
pouts and poses like a runway model, basically frowning that the

hats aren't working. He's staring at her as if nothing else exists
in the universe. She knows it.

...Wavey alone at a cash register. The checker is ringing up a
selection of lacy bras and panties. Suddenly, Wavey looks up to
see Quoyle at the register one aisle over, staring fixedly at her
purchases. Seeing she's noticed him, he holds up a huge pair of
loud boxer shorts he's buying, and WAVES them at her. She laughs
and waves her bras right back. Civilians watching think they're
in love.

EXT./INT. ST. JOHN'S - DAY/NIGHT

...Quoyle and Wavey stroll the grounds of Nolan's future retirement
home. It is twilight, and the modest place looks pleasant and
welcoming. Quoyle listens earnestly, as the director points things
out. Wavey watching Quoyle, her gaze not so disapproving after
all.

...CLOSE on Quoyle with a bowling ball, poised, glaring our way.
Here he comes. Stumbles. Lets go. REVERSE ANGLE to see the ball
rolling, rolling real slow. Quoyle turns his back, strides away
with confidence like he doesn't even have to watch, this is too
easy. Wavey points, look. He turns in time to see two pins fall.
Pumps his fist. YESSSS!

INT. BAR - NIGHT

It's late. It's dim. It's as romantic as urban Newfoundland will
ever get. Our couple nursing beers at the corner table of a
passably stylish bar. Piano playing show tunes, but soft. He
pulls from his pocket...

...a travel brochure.     Slightly drunk, completely merry, almost
wicked smile.

                             QUOYLE
                   Now, listen to this for t'morrow.
                   After I sign the papers at the home...

She's already grinning.     Feels so comfortable.

                             QUOYLE (reads)
                   The answer to your annual outing!
                   Rainbow trout fishing in four ponds.
                   You pay for what you catch. Prizes
                   in the ponds. If it drizzles or gets
                   chilly, heated and lighted building
                   available, right next to the ponds,
                   with soft drinks, candy bars, ice
                   cream and chips!

His subtle smile.     A guy could get used to this irony stuff.

                             WAVEY
                   Or we could sleep in.

...innocent, natural.       At some primal level, his panic begins.

                            WAVEY
                  I just feel so guilty about all
                  your expenses. Two separate rooms.
                  Both so big.

                            QUOYLE
                  Hey, it's my treat.     You agreed.

She nods.    She did.

                           WAVEY
                  Still. Seems like we could figure
                  out. Something.

Even Quoyle. Has the message. He looks down at his beer, as he
thinks about what he should say. Turns the glass in his fingers.

                            QUOYLE
                  A friend told me once. Love is
                  the only thing that counts.

He nods.    Almost to himself.

                            QUOYLE (a murmur)
                  It's the engine of life.

He looks up.    Her eyes are waiting.

                            QUOYLE
                  So when you told me how you think
                  about your husband. I really
                  understood, becau...

                            WAVEY
                  That's what I wanted us to talk
                  abou...

                            QUOYLE
                  ...because real love.     Just comes
                  once.

And everything.    Stops.

                            QUOYLE
                  See, you know some of the stories
                  about Petal. Some of the bad things.
                  What you don't know...

But she's looking in his eyes.       And so, she does.

                            WAVEY (just above a whisper)
                  ...is how much you love her.

That's what it is.

                               WAVEY
                   Even tho.    She never loved you.

A beat.

                               QUOYLE
                   Sorta.    Because of it.

He sighs. The most miserable and the most honest he has ever been.
All at once.

                             QUOYLE
                   See, love. Isn't about what's good
                   for you. Isn't about what you wish
                   it was. Isn't about what...would
                   make you happy.

His eyes are swimming.       Can she possibly hear this?

                             QUOYLE
                   Love. Is about want. What you
                   really want. And you can't change
                   that. Even if it's poison.

Silence.   The piano plays something gay and stupid.

                             QUOYLE
                   So that's why it's great. To have a
                   real friend. When you're. Lonely.

The last word was a tough one.       It makes her nod. She stares in
his eyes for the longest time.       And when she speaks, he can scarely
hear her voice...

                             WAVEY
                   I know you have to stay tomorrow.
                   To sign the papers. But.

But.   One word.    And even a stupid guy.    Gets it all.

                             WAVEY
                   I should be heading back. Before
                   Herry. Misses me. Too much.

Wow. He nods, dumbly.        Watching his worst nightmare unfold before
his eyes.

                              WAVEY
                   And I'm not feeling so well.
                   What I get for mixing vodka and
                   beer, huh.

She gets to her feet.       She does seem a little unsteady.

                             WAVEY
                   So I'll grab a taxi. You stay and
                   finish. Listen to the music. Is

                   that all right?

                              QUOYLE
                   I cou...

But he stops.     Because she's shaken her head once.      Don't.

                             WAVEY
                   And don't worry.     I'm still your friend.

Her voice chokes a little on that.        She shakes her head, half-
grinning at how foolish she feels.        She smiles at him now. Like
she means it.

And leaves.     Without another word.

                             QUOYLE (V.O.)
                   She did stay my friend. In her way.
                   Even tho, for awhile, we didn't see
                   each other a lot.

He wants to cry. He wants to be sick. He doesn't know what he
wants. Fumbles in his pocket for some wadded-up bills.

                             QUOYLE (V.O.)
                   Funny. How one little talk.      Can
                   change everything.

DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO...

INT. SKIPPER WILL'S DINER - NIGHT

The boys, the beers, the squidburgers.        The usual.

                             QUOYLE
                   Tell me about it. Just get the
                   aunt's house fixed perfect, and
                   I gotta move.

Move?

                             QUOYLE
                   Three hours to drive from the Point,
                   with all the ice. Alvin won't have
                   my boat ready til New Years. Agnis
                   can stay over her shop. Bunny and I
                   have to find a room in town.

                             DENNIS
                   Stay with us. My kid follows yours
                   around, they'll bunk t'gether. And
                   we gotta fluffy couch that's more'n
                   you deserve.

A good friend.     Quoyle is touched.

                              QUOYLE

                  Hopin' you'd offer, almost
                  worth it just t'inconvenience ya.
                  Unfortunately, I'm too fond a
                  yer wife.

                            NUTBEEM (casual)
                  Take my trailer. Timing's perfect.

The way he said that.     They both turn.     A shrug...

                            NUTBEEM
                  It's two years. My boat's ready.
                  If I stay any longer, I'll begin
                  to like it here.

Wouldn't want that. Very silent at this table.            Against the din of
the place. Is he serious?

                            NUTBEEM (softly)
                  I'm throwing myself a farewell
                  party on Saturday. Departure
                  to follow Sunday. Regrets, soon
                  after, no doubt.

And smiles.    Serious as a heart attack.      A long beat.

                            QUOYLE (a murmur)
                  Be careful.

Careful?

                            QUOYLE
                  Last friend left me.      Turned into
                  a truck driver.

So much feeling behind his eyes.     Nutbeem can only say...

                             NUTBEEM
                  Well.   With that warning.

And return the feeling.     With his own.

EXT./INT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - TWILIGHT

Quoyle GROANING under the weight of cases of beer and cheap rum
pulled from the back of his wagon. Plenty more to go. Staggers
into...

...Nutbeem's   tiny, threadbare trailer. Every conceivable surface
under stacks   of plastic-wrapped party platters of cold cuts, cheese
and red-eyed   olives. Nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice.
Quoyle peers   into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom...

                            QUOYLE
                  What's the barrel for?

SEE it now.    Half a sawed-off empty BARREL, with MOLASSES stenciled

in orange, fills the shower stall.

                           NUTBEEM
                 I'm British. I bathe.

Quoyle sends him a blank look.

                           QUOYLE
                 Perfect for th' chips.

He gestures to thirty bags of potato chips, filling the
kitchenette.

                           NUTBEEM
                 It's coated with two kinds of scum.
                 Soap. And mine.

                             QUOYLE
                 Works.    We forgot to buy dip.

INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

VIEW out a window at the line of HEADLIGHTS still arriving. We are
immersed in the ungodly WHITE NOISE of an all-gentleman's Newfie
soiree, music pushed beyond the level of distortion, assorted
grunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. As we
struggle to look around...

...every square inch is    crammed tight with semi-conscious drunks.
Tert Card and some boys    circle the potato chip barrel, which has
become a handy urinal.     Near the door, Dennis holding forth, arm
tight around Quoyle who    listens, listens, chuckles. Then Quoyle
fights his way...

...OUT of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is MUCH
wilder, given the elbow room. Quoyle steps OVER the supine form o
Billy Pretty, who is singing to himself. Finds Jack Buggit with a
beer in one hand a rum in the other. Wraps a drunken arm around
Jack's neck. Starts to talk in his ear. Jack looks suspicious. A
FIGHT breaks out a few feet away. They don't notice. Closing in,
to hear...

                           QUOYLE (shouting against the din)
                 SO THE NEXT DAY, THEY ALL SIT DOWN
                 ON THE GIRDER. THE BRIT OPENS HIS
                 LUNCH BOX. 'OH, NO! SCOTCH SALMON
                 AGAIN! FAREWELL, BOYS!' AND HE
                 JUMPS OFF THE GIRDER TO HIS DEATH.

Jack nods.   Grins.    That's pretty funny.

                           QUOYLE
                 THE QUEBEC GUY OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX.
                 'MON DIEU! MEAT PIE AGAIN! AU
                 REVOIR CRUEL WORLD!' AND HE JUMPS.

This.   Is even funnier.

                           QUOYLE
                 NOW THE STATIE IS ALL ALONE ON
                 THE GIRDER. HE OPENS HIS BOX.
                 'HOLY MOLEY! BOLOGNA SANDWICH
                 AGAIN! I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS!'
                 AND LEAPS OFF.

Funniest yet.   Jack is chuckling already.

                           QUOYLE
                 AT THE FUNERAL. THE BRIT' S WIFE
                 SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME HE HATED
                 SALMON?' FRENCHY'S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY
                 DIDN'T HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MEAT
                 PIE?' STATIE'S WIFE SAYS, 'I DON'T
                 GET IT. HE ALWAYS MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!'

Quoyle is chortling.   But Jack stares him dead in the eyes.

                           JACK
                 YOU'RE SURE. THE FELLER WAS A STATIE.

                             QUOYLE
                 OH, YAR.    FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.

At which point Jack BUSTS OUT laughing fit to wet his pants...

                           JACK
                 MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!

POUNDING on poor Quoyle, who is also dissolved in hysterics.
Nearby, the biggest and ugliest GUY at the party (no small
distinction) leaps onto a tree stump brandishing an AXE.
Even in this crowd, it commands a certain degree of attention.

                           BIG UGLY GUY
                 NOW WE ALL LOVES OLD FOOKIN' NUTBEEM,
                 YAR???

Cries of YAR! fill the woods. Nutbeem himself is HOISTED on
shoulders, whooping and sloshing his grog.

                           BIG UGLY GUY
                 SO LESS KEEP 'IM 'ERE BYES! AXE
                 'IS FOOKIN' BOAT! GOT YER CHAIN
                 SAW, NEDDIE??

An idea that wins IMMEDIATE MASS APPROVAL. Soused Nutbeem's eyes
open bug-wide, as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the
docks. Whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective.

And rather suddenly.   Quoyle is left alone.

Among the conscious, that is.

INT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Knitted wool, the color of oxblood, lies across a timeworn leather
ottoman. In front of it, little Herry dances a shuffle-foot jig of
his own design. The music seeps from a venerable accordian, played
earnestly by his serious mom, nodding and tapping her foot to the
time of his steps.

There is a feeling of empowerment and release in Herry. His grin
splits his round face. His eyes say that his heart is dancing.

PULL SLOWLY BACK...through the window, past the porch, across the
front yard. To a figure. By the fence. He stands motionless.
Except his foot is tapping, very slightly, to the time of the
music.

We can't tell how much Quoyle sees.    But his eyes say that his
heart is drowning.

EXT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - MORNING

As Quoyle shuffles up, we see Nutbeem's trailer has been turned
completely OVER onto its side. Walls are crushed and splintered.
It's a train wreck.

Sitting on the cinder blocks that once supported it, Nutbeem,
and Dennis swig beers.

                          NUTBEEM (cheery)
                You're looking dishy, Q.

                           QUOYLE
                Feeling that and more.    What's the
                situation?

Nutbeem hands him a beer.

                          NUTBEEM
                One. You're moving in with Dennis, no
                matter how fond you are of his wife.

Quoyle looks sadly at the trailer.    Realizing it was his place that
got trashed.

                          NUTBEEM (laughs)
                And the boat! Omigod!

                          BILLY
                I'm some disgusted.    With the human race.

                          NUTBEEM
                I'da never made it, anyway. Storms
                would have blown me to bits. You
                boys saved my life. Yes, you did.

The boys look at each other.    Humiliated by his generosity.

                            NUTBEEM

                   I've gathered my savings, and am
                   flying to Brazil. Where water is
                   swimming pool green. And I grill
                   yellowtail steaks with lime and
                   garlic, watercress and Tobasco.
                   Touch of curry. What?

Quoyle is looking at him somewhat strangely.

                             QUOYLE (light)
                   I collect friends who cook.     Just
                   can't keep 'em.

Maybe too light not to be obvious.     Billy looks from Quoyle to the
trailer. And back.

                             BILLY
                   It's too bad.

Which seems to cover everything.

EXT. JACK BUGGIT'S SKIFF - DAY

Quoyle alone with Jack in open water. Pulling on a slicker,
gloves, picking up a knife. Jack is pronging cod onto the deck.

                             JACK
                   Hands might as well be movin' while
                   we chat. Always hated th' sight a
                   grown men around a table workin'
                   nuthin' but their jaws.

And so, together, they begin to clean a small mountain of cod.

                             QUOYLE
                   Editorial meetin', y'say.     'Bout
                   what?

                             JACK
                   Well, Tert Card's gone, fer one
                   thing.

Doesn't look up.

                             JACK
                   Yar, I know, he never said g'bye.
                   Well, don't get all weepy-eyed
                   about it, old son. Try t'be a man.

Quoyle will.

                             JACK
                   They called him from St. John's,
                   he tells me. Wants him to help
                   put out th' newsletter fer them
                   oil rig suppliers.

Yup.     Believe it.

                             JACK
                   He was sassy an' he was smug. Oh,
                   there's a waitin' list, he assures
                   me. They only skims th' cream.

                             QUOYLE
                   Well, don't get all weepy-eyed abou...

                             JACK
                   Truth t'tell. I was a wee help.
                   B'hind the scenes, doncha know.

Keeps working.

                                JACK (quietly)
                   Sometimes.     Enough is enough.

No arguments arise.

                             QUOYLE
                   Well, Billy'll do a helluva job...

                             JACK (nods)
                   ...right where he is. Too old a
                   fish t'swim faster'n be wants.
                   Gotta find someone a little dumber
                   t'take on a shit job like this!

Uh-oh.     You don't mean...

                             JACK
                   Spot I'm in, Christmas and all.
                   Might have to offer th'mess. To you.

Quoyle swallows.       Arguably the proudest moment of his life.

                                QUOYLE
                   Course.     I'd need a raise.

Jack looks at him for the first time.        A real twinkle behind...

                             JACK
                   Y'know. Yer do have the sense God
                   gave a doughnut.

                             QUOYLE (genuinely touched)
                   I'II try to live up to that.

Said with such sincerity, Jack can only nod.          Good.

                             JACK
                   Any other outrageous demands?
                   Seein' as yer got me over a
                   barrel. Here's your one chance.

And before he can stop his mouth...

                            QUOYLE
                  Well, your son...

The mirth dies in his host's eyes. Like a 60-watt bulb in a
brownout. Quoyle swallows the rest.

                            JACK
                  You were sayin'...?

Quoyle sucks it up.

                            QUOYLE
                  His whole life would be changed.
                  If he could come upon. A fishing
                  license.

Jack's eyes.   Flat and cold as the cod he's gutting.

                            JACK
                  Well, there's only one a those
                  issued per family. So how exactly
                  would he do that?

This is not.   Going well.   A dangerous silence.

                            JACK
                  Even doughnuts, y'know.   Can
                  push their luck.

INT. WAVEY'S PARLOR - DUSK

The day care contingent more organized today. Sort of. Bunny
leading a spirited round of red-light/green-light, as...

...Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents. As he
shrugs off his coat, he looks at the Christmas tree, its winking
lights. The decorations that seem to be everywhere, many handmade
by these children. He watches Bunny call out 'Red Light!', only to
have Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway.

Mixed emotions, to be sure. A feeling of family he can at least
visit, yet will never be his own. The sad edge catches up with
him, so he strolls on into...

...the kitchen. Wavey baking, what else.      She smiles to see him.
A friend's smile.

                            WAVEY (Southern belle)
                  Why, Mistuh Quoyle. You shouldn't
                  have!

He smiles back.    Takes her in for a telling beat, before...

                             QUOYLE
                  Uh.   I didn't. Most of these

                 are for Herry.

Even better.

                           QUOYLE
                 There's two. Are yours.

They are on top. Personally wrapped in his slightly bulging,
fine-motor-control-challenged, personal style. Be sets them on the
counter.

                            QUOYLE
                 You prob'ly want to wait for
                 Christmas.

Meaning, please don't. So she wipes her hands on her apron.    Lets
him see her eyes dance just a flicker.

                           WAVEY
                 Oh, I'm much too excited.

Delicately unwraps the first. Lifts out a PORCELAIN TEAPOT, finely
painted with an assortment of BERRIES. She holds it in her hands,
at once admiring and wistful. Wondering if there's a message about
their moment together while berry-picking.

                           QUOYLE
                 It's from a museum catalogue.       But
                 it's not real. It's a copy.

                           WAVEY (still gazing at it)
                 It is my favorite teapot.

A simple pronouncement. She opens the second, flat and narrow. It
is a TURQUOISE BRACELET. Actually, kind of stunning. She blinks,
taken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense.

                           QUOYLE
                 It's nice for your eyes.     I thought.

She doesn't sayanything.   Lets it dangle from her fingers, catch
the light.

                           QUOYLE
                 It's for everyday. You don't have
                 to save it for special.

She looks to him. Her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants.
Her voice perhaps softer than she even intends...

                           WAVEY
                 Oh, I'll save this, all right.

Covers.   With only a slightly more than friendly smile.

                           WAVEY
                 And I'll think of you.     When I

                put lot on.

He can only nod. He'd like that.    She holds up one finger, wait a
second. And hurries off.

So he waits. Looking at her kitchen. Feeling his feelings.         She
is back, with two boxes. Sets them down. Nods, go ahead...

...one is heavy and square. He opens it to find a LEATHER-BOUND
CASE. He looks at her, smiles in his childlike way. Opens the
case, which reveals...

...two leather-bound VOLUMES. One a dictionary.      The other a
thesaurus. He is obviously moved.

                          QUOYLE (a murmur)
                You must have me mistaken. For
                a writer.

And when he looks up.

                          WAVEY
                I don't make mistakes.     About
                that kind of thing.

He stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the other
package. Big and flat, but not heavy at all. He lifts the lid,
and pulls out...

...a huge comfy SWEATER.   In oxblood wool.    He is completely
stunned to realize...

                          WAVEY (so pleased)
                Well, you can't be surprised. You've
                seen me knitting it for months.

                          QUOYLE
                It was so big, I thought it was a
                tea cozy for your car. But if it's
                for me, it has to be bigger, huh?

Put it on, put it on! So he slips it over his head. Big enough
and then some. This worries her. She plucks at it...

                           WAVEY
                Well.   You'll grow into it.

                          QUOYLE
                You kiddin'? After the holidays,
                we'll have to stretch it.

He's just beaming. Hugs himself to show how warm it is.      The
silence is companionable. Then...

                          QUOYLE
                Not used to a woman.     Giving me
                presents.

She raises a brow.     Can scarcely believe that.

                            QUOYLE
                  One Christmas with Petal, I gave her
                  eleven things. And I wrapped them.
                  And watched her open them up.

She holds her friendly smile.     But her eyes have changed.
Slightly.

                            QUOYLE
                  She didn't have anything for me.
                  Like every year. But this one
                  time, she said, 'Wait a minute.'

Wait a minute.

                            QUOYLE
                  She ran to the kitchen. I heard
                  the fridge open. She came back.
                  With her hands hidden behind her.
                  Then, she held out...

Even his voice.    Betrays the longing.

                             QUOYLE
                  Two brown eggs. She gave them
                  to me from her own hands. They
                  were cold.

He smiles, self-conscious.

                            QUOYLE
                  Must sound really stupid.   But
                  they meant a lot to me.

Silence.   A soft...

                             WAVEY
                  Well.   It's the thought that counts.

He nods.   He's glad she understands.

                            QUOYLE
                  I broke 'em, careful. Made her an
                  omelette with 'em. And I saved the
                  shells. In a little box.

She can't help but show her surprise at that.

                            QUOYLE
                  Oh, yeh. They're on a shelf
                  behind my desk. At the paper.

He looks worried now.     Shouldn't have brought this up.   And seeing
this...

                             WAVEY
                   I know how it is. To hold onto
                   something good. In the middle of
                   all the bad.

He nods.     But feels truly awkward now.     So...

                             QUOYLE
                   Well. I gotta collect Bunny.
                   Beety's gonna have supper waiting.

Right.     She nods.   She understands this, too.

                                WAVEY
                   Thank you.     Thank you, very much.

Takes her teapot and her bracelet.        Holds them.     A gentle barrier.
Her hands now too full for a hug.

                              QUOYLE
                   Well.   Merry Christmas!

With a wonderful smile.

                             WAVEY
                   Merry Christmas.

With one of her own.

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Quoyle enters a packed auditorium, festooned for Christ's birthday
with every trimming imaginable. Rough fishermen in black jackets
they wear once a year, women in finery, schoolkids at their well-
scrubbed best, antsy with anticipation. The BUZZ is audible,
palpable. No Broadway opening could hope for this level of
eagerness.

As Quoyle comes down the aisle, we see faces we know. Boys from
Nutbeem's party. Billy Pretty with Jack and Mrs. Buggit. Alvin
Yark and his bird-like wife. The old-timer who sold Quoyle his
boat. Mavis Bangs with an empty seat next to her, must be saved
for Agnis. All the kids from daycare. Still, Quoyle searching for
the face he doesn't find. And finally...

...to the third row, where Dennis and Beety have saved him a seat.
Beety gives him a peck on the cheek, and he smiles, settling in,
nervous as hell, just as...

...the school principal, still dressed for England, walks to the
mike at center stage. Holds up her hands like the disciplinarian
she prides herself on being, and they quiet pretty fast.

                             PRINCIPAL
                   Your friends and neighbors, and
                   most of all, your children. Have

                worked hard to bring you the best
                pageant ever.

THUNDEROUS applause, whistling, stamping. She is frustrated for a
moment. Then, waves cheerily against the din, shouting...

                          PRINCIPAL
                LET THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN!

And RUNS off-stage, as we DISSOLVE THROUGH a SERIES OF ANGLES...

...the Big Ugly Guy who led the raid on poor Nutbeem's boat stands
in a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk, singing DANNY BOY in
the sweetest tenor one could dream of. PAN an audience, rapt,
motionless. Pavarotti never had more respect.

...Bunny and Marty walk timidly to the front of the stage. Marty
dressed in Christmas reds and greens. Bunny all in blue, which
does look good on her. Kids CALL OUT their names. The place falls
quiet. And the girls begin to sing a plaintive West African HYMN
in small brave voices that sometimes harmonize. It is unexpected
and breathtakingly courageous. Two dads in the third row have
tears flooding their eyes...

                          DENNIS (gruff whisper)
                Not bad, my kid, eh?

                            QUOYLE (gruffer whisper)
                I'll say.    She's as good as mine.

...Agnis Hamm walks out alone onto the stage, wearing a brown
jersey, tweed skirt, yellow stockings and red slippers. She has
an odd look on her face, all serious and curious. The laughter and
calls die away to silence. Suddenly, one of her feet SCRATCHES at
the stage, her arms become WINGS, and with a CROONING and CACKLING
she metamorphoses into a PEEVISH HEN protecting an egg. The house
comes DOWN with laughter and UNISON applause. Quoyle glances back
at Mavis Bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and WHISTLES
in pure delight.

...Wavey Prowse walks onto the rear of the stage, in a long black
smock, carrying her accordion. She turns to the wings, nods, and
out comes little Herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes. A
beat of silence. Mom calls out: ONE, TWO, THREE, rolls into a
savage hornpipe and Herry commences the JIG Quoyle once glimpsed
through a window. Three hundred HEELS coming STOMPING down in
perfect rhythm and lift Herry into a joyous bouncing, rattling
performance that builds in intensity until the finish. He runs
to the edge of the stage, bows DEEP from the waist, stands beaming
in their applause. Then RACES offstage, his mom following with
dignity, and we go with her into the wings...

Once there, Wavey slips OUT of the smock, revealing to the dimness
of the wings, that she is wearing dancer's tights over drop-dead
legs. A close-fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles,
crystal diamonds, and dozens more glittering baubles that send a
shimmer of prisms with her every breath. Herry hands her a top

hat, a cane, and...

...she STALKS back onto the stage, her lithe body strutting and
glinting. A hush of stupefaction falls, only to be washed away
by SHOUTS and WHISTLES, the kind of which have not been heard
since Gypsy Rose Lee startled her first roomful of rubes. In
the bedlam...

...she TWIRLS the top hat on one finger, FLIPS it up in a double
somersault, catching it square on her head. She leans on her cane

And when at last they quiet...

                           WAVEY
                 We all know Billy Pretty's ways.
                 Never save fifty cents, if you
                 can save a dollar.

She winks.   They laugh.   Billy laughing loudest.

                           WAVEY
                 Well, last Feb'ry, Billy wants
                 t'get his grandfather clock repaired.
                 Calls old Leander Mesher. Local
                 call. No charge.

Twirls the cane recklessly.    In the third row, a goggle-eyed Quoyle
couldn't blink if he tried.

                           WAVEY
                 Well, says Leander, the big cost is
                 pickup and delivery. Got t'charge
                 fifty dollars, each way. Two strong
                 boys. Gasoline. Air in the tires!

That's right.

                           WAVEY
                 There's no cost for air in yer
                 tires!, says Bill. Get wi' th'times,
                 he's told. Tis called inflation!

WAGGLES her eyebrows, Groucho-style.    They are busting their guts
laughing. Connoisseurs of wit.

                           WAVEY
                 Billy lives at the top of the hill,
                 Leander at the bot tom, doncha know.
                 So Billy gets a rope, HOISTS the
                 grandfather UP on his back. And
                 muttering the words fifty bucks...

She puts her toe out, SLIPS wildly, windmilling her arms,
pantomiming as she bends double under the phantom clock.

                           WAVEY
                 Mite slick. Four feet thick a ice.

Tears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more.

                           WAVEY
                 Meanwhile, at the bottom, Auntie
                 Fizzard, 91 years young, sets out
                 in her non-slip galoshes and her
                 cane with the rubber tip. Didn't
                 yer, dearie?

Bows to the old gal in the front row, who is scarlet-faced in
hysterics, as all around her applaud. Wavey becomes her, inching
along, casting fierce glances right and left to warn the world.

                           WAVEY
                 Meanwhile, at the top...

She is Billy once more, beneath his burden, her long legs stutter-
stepping to one side, then the other, slipping, skidding, the
howling all around her threatening to shatter walls, and...

                           WAVEY
                 ...OVER he goes, clock-side down,
                 and PICKIN' UP SPEED!

Miming the wild ride as they ROAR...

                           WAVEY
                 ...eight blocks, NINE, missing
                 everything like a miracle, zeroing in on...

She becomes Auntie Fizzard once more, shuffling, looking left,
right, and suddenly up WILD-EYED!

                           WAVEY
                 CLIPS 'er inta the snow bank!

Nods sadly.   Leaning on her cane.     When at last they quiet.

                           WAVEY
                 Just two galoshes stickin' outta
                 the snow. She digs 'er way out.
                 Brushes herself off. Looks at
                 him sprawled like a turtle on his
                 back, tied to his massive burden.
                 She says...

She says.

                              WAVEY
                 YOU THERE!     BILLY PRETTY!

Levels a dead-eyed killer gaze.

                           WAVEY
                 WHY CAN'T YOU WEAR A WRISTWATCH
                 LIKE EVER'BODY ELSE?

The place comes DOWN like a house of cards. Bedlam surrounds
Quoyle who sits still as a stone. Too dazzled to breathe.

EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING.

Lonely stretch of wooded road, middle of nowhere. Light snow just
starting to fall. A truck pulls up beneath a tree. Out climbs...

...Wavey. Looking grim, walking slow. Crosses the road to a
weathered diner. The woman who only smokes when she's worried,
pulls out a pack of Camels. Looks through the diner's frosted
window...

...a lone customer sits nursing his coffee. He is 40, lean, very
attractive. Dark hard eyes, set into worries of their own. Wavey
lights up. Watches in silence until...

...the man looks up. Their eyes meet through the glass.      Hold.
And on his faint smile...

She turns her back.   Starts up the road.

ANGLE...he is walking beside her now. Snow drifting lazy, her
smoke curling up. He watches her anger, how cold and quiet and
closed. Smiles at her profile...

                           HEROLD
                 I shoulda come last night.     Seen
                 the show.

She can't even believe he said that.     Never looking at him...

                           WAVEY
                 Woulda been a thrill for the
                 Christians among' em. They
                 think you're dead.

Keep walking.   His smile is gentle.

                           HEROLD
                 Well, then we got good news
                 for th...

                           WAVEY
                 So does your son.

A beat.

                           HEROLD
                 Even better news for him.

                           WAVEY (low)
                 You think so.

Breaking the words off.   He's watching her profile.

                           HEROLD (very soft)
                 I can't undo the hurt I've done.
                 Unless you let me.

Gauging the feeling behind the bitterness.

                           HEROLD
                 There's a million reasons to send
                 me away. Good ones. And only two
                 reasons not to.

Is she even listening?     He lets the silence hang.

                           HEROLD
                 I love you. And you love me.

She stops walking.     Flips her cigarette off into the snow.       Turns
now...

Looks into his face.     And sighs.

EXT. SHORELINE - DAY

Rear ANGLE of Agnis, crouching in the lightly falling snow. At the
edge of the sea. The spot where she once sent her dog to rest.
HEAR footfalls crunching slowly across the rocks. A bulky figure
comes into frame. Crouches down beside her. Close. She stares at
the gray horizon.

                           QUOYLE (softly)
                 Mavis Bangs. Told me where
                 you'd be.

No answer.   But she hears him all right.

                           QUOYLE
                 We get so little mention in the
                 wires. Thought you'd like to see.

He hands the folded print-out to her.

                           QUOYLE
                 Head in the suitcase.       The mystery's
                 solved.

She looks briefly at his eyes.        Takes it.   Starts to read.

                           QUOYLE
                 Silver Melville was captured in
                 Moored with a cruise steward. The
                 boy was twenty, a looker, wearing
                 Armani clothes. Driving a nice Lexus.

Agnis keeps reading.

                           QUOYLE
                 Says she did it all for love.

She nods at that.      Folds the paper neatly, as if conveying respect.
Hands it back.

                              AGNIS
                    She'd call me, time to time.
                    Husband was a pig. More women should
                    do what she done. Her situation.

He looks in her eyes.      And decides to say...

                              QUOYLE
                    Some women. Shoulda done it to
                    their brother.

The look holds.      She sees the compassion in his eyes.        Knows he's
so on her side.      She clears her throat.

                              AGNIS (softly)
                    Cousin Nolan. Hafta pay him
                    a visit.

They share a look.      He glances at the sea.        Beautiful spot.

                              QUOYLE
                    Mavis said you buried Warren here.
                    Called it an anniversary.

She stares deep and unblinking into his eyes.            She will tell him.

                                 AGNIS
                    Of a loss.     But not the dog.

A held moment.

                              AGNIS
                    What makes us do that, nephew?
                    Give ourselves away to someone.
                    So we can't eat or think or
                    breathe without 'em?

                              QUOYLE (just above a whisper)
                    I don't know. We just do.

Silence.   And...

                              AGNIS
                    Wonderful, ain't it?

And now she smiles.      Something we have rarely seen.

                              AGNIS
                    Irene Warren died. The mornin'
                    after a Christmas. We get one
                    true love in life, nephew. She
                    was mine.

He's not surprised.     And that, in turn, does not really surprise
her.

                          AGNIS
                Don't mean we can't give love
                again. And get some back.

                          QUOYLE
                For some, it does.

                          AGNIS (straight back)
                Not for me.

Strong with that.     Sure.

                          AGNIS
                And if that ruffles some small
                town feathers...

His smile in return.     Very real.

                          QUOYLE
                Y'know what the feathers around
                here need th' most? A good ruffling,
                I say.

He sounds pretty sure himself.         Their look ho1ds.

                          QUOYLE
                Y'know what I need th' most?

She doesn't.

                          QUOYLE
                A really big breakfast!

She nods, one last time.      Sounds like a plan.

INT. GAMMY BIRD - LATE NIGHT

Quoyle alone with his cut-and-paste, making up the front page
layout. Moonlight on fallen snow through the window. Late enough,
quiet enough, to hear...

...the vehicle drive up, the engine turn off. The footfalls to the
door, which swings open. The last person he'd expect to see.
Especially with a bottle. Of Cuervo Gold.

They stare at each other.      Only he smiles.

                             QUOYLE
                Hey.     Congratulations.

She shoots him a quizzical look.         We see the edge right off, even
if he doesn't.

                              QUOYLE

                Last night.     On the stage?    You
                were...

Shakes his head with innocent admiration.       She puts the bottle on
his desk.

                          WAVEY
                It was easy. I just kept thinkin'.
                How would Petal do it?

He hears it now, right enough. The anger, the Cuervo. She stalks
on over to the coffee counter, only a bit wobbly. Plucks up two
styrofoam cups.

                          WAVEY
                We're friends, right?     Friends
                drink together.

Back to his desk. Shrugs her coat off onto the floor. Pullover
and jeans, she looks terrific. Hikes her butt up onto the edge of
his desk.

                          WAVEY
                I asked a quest...

                          QUOYLE (quiet)
                I'll drink with you. If you're
                not done yet.

Her soft throaty laugh. He hasn't seen her this way.        Can't decide
if it's more scary or exciting.

                          WAVEY
                Not drunk enough yet to talk about
                Petal. Which we always seem to do.

Opens the bottle.   About four fingers are gone.

                          WAVEY
                Let's talk about me.     Which we don't.

Pours herself another two.    Thinks before she says...

                          WAVEY
                Growin' up, all I wanted from this
                place was out. Imagine. Give up
                all this.

Pours two fingers for him. Stretches her body to slide the cup
across the desk. The Cuervo sloshes.

                          WAVEY
                I ran off to Toronto, went to
                school. Wanted to be a social
                worker. For kids.

She's looking at her cup now.     Not at him.

                             WAVEY
                   Came back one summer.     Fell for
                   Herold Prowse. That.      Was that.

Takes a swallow.     Closes her eyes.

                             WAVEY
                   Did you know I was a liar?

Opens her eyes.     Straight into his.     Did you?

                             WAVEY
                   Herold liked other women.     But you
                   know how that is.

Sure you do.

                             WAVEY (whispers)
                   He didn't die. Not that he didn't
                   deserve to.

Quoyle blinks.     A perfect stunned ox gape.

                             WAVEY
                   See, I'm a good liar.

Drains her cup.

                             WAVEY
                   He ran off to Seattle with some
                   bitch. When his damaged son was
                   two months old. And nobody knew.

An ice-cold wink.

                             WAVEY
                   Like I said. It's four years ago.
                   And it's yesterday.

Pours herself another.     Savors the memory.

                             WAVEY
                   So I took his boat out. I sunk it.
                   And told my little story. Grieving
                   widow.

Shrugs a drunken, careless shrug.

                             WAVEY
                   I was leaving, of course. Why
                   humiliate myself on the wayout?

Yes?

                             WAVEY (softer)
                   But a funny thing happened.        On

                   my way out.

Her eyes are deeper now.      And for a beat, the anger slips away.

                             WAVEY
                   All these funny, odd little folks?
                   They put their hearts around me.
                   So I wouldn't be alone. Having
                   lost the man I loved.

Silence.   A real one.

                             WAVEY
                   And since I knew, to my shame, that
                   is exactly what I had lost. I let
                   go of the will to leave. I did.

I did.

                             WAVEY
                   Decided to let my child grow up.
                   Around folks better than his mom.

Stares in his eyes.

                             WAVEY
                   You're quite the talker.

                             QUOYLE (quiet)
                   I take pride in that.

So she smiles.     But the bitterness is there in it.

                             WAVEY
                   Well, this morning.     The man I
                   loved. Came back.

And the world. Ceases to spin.         One man's world, at least.   She
watches that. Assesses it.

                             WAVEY
                   Told me he knew.     I loved him still.

Sips at her second drink.        Slides the rest of it down.

                             WAVEY
                   Okay. Now I'm drunk enough.         To
                   talk about Petal.

Her eyes ask.    Are you?

                             WAVEY
                   You're thinking we're kindred
                   souls, you and me. In love with
                   our nightmares.

Shakes her head.     Uh-uh.

                             WAVEY
                   You don't love your Petal. You
                   hate. Her cheating. Guts.

Means those words as an opening blow.      Jacks or better.      Here comes
the hole card...

                              WAVEY
                   You have to think it's love.
                   Because if it's not, you're dead
                   inside. So you keep that flame a
                   flickering. Cos it's all you'll
                   ever have.

Pure contempt.     And honesty.

                              WAVEY
                   You see.   You're a good liar, too.

Lifts the cap.     Screws it back on the bottle.

                             WAVEY
                   Where's the damn eggshells?     That's
                   all I came to see.

And from his prison of shock and shame.      He points to a shelf.      She
is OFF his desk, like a panther...

...SNATCHES the tiny padded box with its treasure.          RAISES it high
to smash it, and...

...stops.    To see the panic.    In his eyes.

It brings tears.     Pooling in hers.

And she sets the treasure down, with the tenderness that decency
requires.

                             WAVEY
                   Can you guess how I know about
                   Petal?

He cannot.

                             WAVEY
                   Because you and I.   Are kindred
                   souls. After all.

And that.    Is what she came to say.

                             WAVEY
                   So I told my husband. To fuck
                   himself. And the ego he rode in on.

She crosses the floor. Scoops up her coat.         Walks, just a little
wobbly, to the door. Sighs.

                           WAVEY
                 Thanks for the mirror.

Nods.   Means that.

                           WAVEY
                 If I don't see you.   Happy New Year.

And leaves. The door closes quietly.      Quoyle looks from it.   To
the eggshells.

And back.

INT. DENNIS' HOUSE - LATER

ANGLE...Dennis and his wife BEETY bundled together asleep, as a
ferocious storm HOWLS around the house.

ANGLE...Quoyle awake on the sofa in Dennis' parlor. Clutching his
blankets around him. Eyes jumping with every SHRIEK of the
marauding wind. Mind racing with thoughts of Wavey. And
eggshells.

ANGLE...Bunny asleep with Dennis' daughter MARTY. The room seems
to vibrate under the violence of the weather's assault. CLOSE on
Bunny now, and...

...her eyes OPEN. A strange intent in them. A knowledge. She
slips from Marty's bed in her thin blue nightdress. Through the
house in the dark, as the wind SCREAMS its warning. Into the par-
lor where her father sleeps, as the wind suddenly INVADES, and...

...SUCKS her straight UP the chimney and out INTO the heart of the
storm. SAILING like a loosened kite out across the black water.
Out and out, as gray light rises, to...

...Quoyle Point, where she is blown FLAT against a granite boulder
just in front of the Green House, which SHIVERS and pleads against
the wind, its steel cables STRAINING, and suddenly from within the
house, lights come ON...

...the WHITE DOG is in a window. No longer snarling and menacing,
but whining pitifully, begging to be saved. And on the second
floor...

...PETAL alone, wild-eyed with terror. She is dressed all in blue,
and her daisy-chain necklace flies about her throat as she POUNDS
against the glass, her eyes staring directly AT her daughter, who
can only scream soundlessly against the gale as the house...

...begins to come LOOSE, the first cable SNAPPING and WHIPPING
about with the fierce destructiveness of unleashed power, then the
NEXT, and ANOTHER, and with Petal still visible, HOWLING in horror,
windows BURSTING everywhere else like flash bulbs, the house...

...slides FREE, along the rocks, toward the cliff, Bunny screeching

as it goes OVER the edge, TUMBLES down toward the sea, and Bunny...

...sits BOLT UPRIGHT in bed, a single GASP as her dad is THERE,
holding her tight. She is soaked with sweat. But her eyes are not
wild. They are filled with the knowing.

                            BUNNY (a whisper)
                 Daddy.   The Green House is gone.

He smooths her hair. The wind bellows in rage.       Little Marty
somehow sleeps on, undisturbed, beside her.

                           BUNNY (a whisper)
                 I didn't dream it. Don't say I did.

EXT. QUOYLE POINT - DAY

They climb from the station wagon into cold, clear sunlight.
Stare in wonder at the naked rock. The snapped, spent, cables.
Only shards of wood and glass leaving a hapless trail toward the
cliff.

Bunny RUNS toward the debris, and through it.     To a tangle of
bushes near the cliff.

He walks to a broken cable. Crouches. His eyes running over the
space. Where his ancestor's home once stood. And then. He
turns...

                           QUOYLE (calls out)
                 What you got there?

We see now. Bunny has unearthed a huge wooden crate from its
hiding place. Too engrossed in counting its contents to respond.

As he comes over...

                           BUNNY (not looking up)
                 Petal's things.

She is counting her treasure trove of NECKLACES. More than any
sound mind could imagine. Yet, in their infinite variety, somehow
wonderful. A testimonial to the power of love.

                           BUNNY
                 I think they're all here.

She looks up.   Sees him staring so fixedly at them.

                           BUNNY (alerted)
                 What's wrong?

                           QUOYLE
                 They're beautiful. I never saw
                 'em. All together.

Oh.   The kid doesn't smile.   She decides whether to ask him...

                           BUNNY
                 Will she be proud to wear 'em?

He looks in her eyes.     His heart breaks behind his smile.

                             QUOYLE
                 Well.    Any woman would.

EXT. JACK BUGGIT'S SKIFF - MORNING

Steel gray morning. The sea is more than a little rough, as Jack
lays out his lobster traps. Two other boats, not too close by,
appear and disappear in mist. He is checking the lines, knotting
hefty weights onto the traps to take them down.

                           JACK (sings to himself)
                 Oh, th' Gandy Goose she ain't no uuuuse
                    Cos all her nuts'n bolts is...

Stops.   Halfway to lowering the next trap over the side.

                           JACK (mutters)
                 Sweet Jesus. I'm turnin' inta
                 Alvin Cockadoodle Yark!

As it nears the water line, Jack's cat SKIPPER TOM suddenly LEAPS
down ONTO the trap. Jack blinks.

                           JACK
                 What is this? Suicide attempt?

Tries to let go of the trap and grab the cat in one motion, but the
cat JUMPS BACK to the boat, Jack STUMBLING out of his way, STEPS in
the coiled line which WHIRRS as the trap goes...

...DOWN, the line STRANGLING Jack's leg and WHIPPING him flailing
OVER the side in one startling heartbeat. Almost comic to watch.

But then. It is very quiet.      Air bubbles appear at the surface.
In a few seconds...

The water is unbroken.     The boat bobs silently in the swells.

INT. ALVIN YARK'S BOAT HOUSE - DAY

Quoyle and Alvin inspect Quoyle's newly-finished boat. It is a
beauty, to be sure, and the old builder watches Quoyle lovingly
running his hand across the smooth gunnel. Alvin doesn't smile.
That's not his style.

                           ALVIN
                 Gotta paint the name. What'll it be?
                 'The Tall And Quiet Woman'?

Quoyle glances over.     The old boy's eyes are dancing.

                           QUOYLE
                 You knew Billy's dad?

                           ALVIN
                 Ever'body knows ever'body. But
                 Billy's pap didn't invent the
                 Four Women in a Man's Life.

Quoyle nods.   Guess not.

                           ALVIN
                 Well. Which one is Bunny, I wonder?
                 The Maid in the Meadow, mebbe.

But Yoda is just staring at him.     And quietly...

                           ALVIN
                 Doncha know? They're all the same
                 woman. That's the point.

His pupil blinks.   Like a crystal bullet of clarity his brain.

                           ALVIN
                 The Maid in the Meadow, that's
                 her innocence and play. The
                 Stouthearted Woman, is when you
                 need to lean on her.

For some reason he could never name.     Tears are pooling in eyes.

                           ALVIN
                 The Tall and Quiet Woman? That's
                 the silent partner who always walks
                 'longside, so's yer never alone.

Quoyle is nodding, now.     It all seems so right.

                           ALVIN
                 And the Demon Lover. That's just
                 the frostin' on th' cake.

A soft knocking at the door.

                            ALVIN
                 When y'find the woman who's all
                 four? That's when y'got yer one
                 true love.

The bird-like woman enters.     The old man nods toward her.

                           ALVIN
                 ...like m'Gertie.

But she isn't alone. A man enters behind her. It is Dennis
Buggit. And there are tears on his face. He brings a dreadful
silence with him, because the face is an open grave.

                          DENNIS
                My dad went over the side this
                mornin'. Tangled in th' sling-
                stone line.

A sob escapes from this strong man's throat.    He ignores it.    No
one knows what to say.

                          DENNIS
                If you could write a memorial t'
                him. Fer t'morrow's Gammy Bird?
                I'd be real grateful.

EXT. JACK BUGGIT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons
Folks still streaming toward the brightly-lit house. Ever'body
knows ever'body.

INT. JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Every room is filled with folks who wear their best. There is
eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we move
through the crowd. As if some have taken hold of a wake's well-
meaning purpose. Others stand dazed, still wearing their pain and
confusion. There are children here, some hold a parent's hand,
some giggle with each other. Snapshot of a community. Struggling
to cope.

Quoyle and Bunny enter, holding hands, looking around.      As they
cross the room...

...two figures step into their path. Two women holding hands,
their bodies close together. Their feeling for each other open for
all to see. One is Agnis. And the other. Isn't Mavis Bangs.

                          DAWN
                Happy New Year, Mr. Quoyle. I'm
                sorry I missed you at the pageant.

Slightly startled, Quoyle can't help but smile, despite the solemn
occasion. At the proud look on his aunt's face.

                          DAWN
                I was in the wings, a course.
                Wasn't our girl somethin'?

Our girl, a course, is Agnis.   Who nearly blushes at the
compliment.

                          DAWN
                I say, y'have t'love a woman. Who's
                in touch with her inner chicken.

Well, who could argue with that. Dawn leans up, kisses Quoyle on
the cheek. And with surprising softness...

                              AGNIS
                   Nephew.   You okay?

                                BUNNY
                   He's okay.     He's not sleeping in
                   the box.

Her great aunt looks at this child. Bends to plant an unexpected
kiss on the top of Bunny's head. The kid squirms, tugs her dad
firmly off, as he sends a parting wave.

Into the parlor now. Quieter here, as the new arrivals thread past
Jack Buggit in his open coffin, resting on black-draped sawhorses.
Dennis and his mom stand by Jack, a hand and a word for each. And
moving into the line...

                             QUOYLE
                   Remember what I told you.

His words a murmur.     Hers are bolder...

                             BUNNY
                   If he's not sleeping.     Why do they
                   call it a awake?

He thinks.   As if it is a worthwhile question.

                             QUOYLE
                   We're the ones have to be awake.
                   To how much we love him...

Nods to himself.     Yes.

                             QUOYLE
                   And how we should be good to each
                   other. While we have the chance.

He looks down.     They are almost there.

                                QUOYLE
                   You think?

She is thinking. Keeping the thoughts to herself. At the coffin
now, he lifts her up to see. Jack lies motionless, a wax figure of
himself. Serene behind violet eyelids.

                             BUNNY
                   He looks like he's sleeping.

Dennis looks over.     His stolid, grim face releases a smile for his
friend.

                             QUOYLE
                   That's cos he's peaceful. No
                   worries, anymore. No troubles.

He sets her down.     Clasps Mrs. Buggit's hand.     And from his

pocket...

                          QUOYLE
                I found this in Jack's drawer at
                the paper. I don't know if it's
                somethin' special...

An enameled wreath with the initial R, backed by a long, sharp pin
She tears up again, just to see it.

                          MRS. BUGGIT
                Oh, it's his lodge pin.    We were
                lookin' all over.

She smiles bravely as she takes it.    Leans up to kiss his cheek.

                          MRS. BUGGIT (a whisper)
                Dennis showed me what y'wrote fer
                th' paper. Did Jack proud.

So they look at each other. Dennis clears his throat, looks away.
And then, Quoyle is leading Bunny off.

                          QUOYLE
                You hungry? There's sandwi...

                          BUNNY
                Petal's peaceful, too.

Just a statement of fact.    To no one in particular.   Dad squeezes
her hand. Manages...

                            QUOYLE
                You bet.    You can count on tha...

But she lets go. Scampers to a corner of the room.      To Herry
Prowse. And his mom.

So Quoyle starts toward her, his heart in his throat. And when
Wavey looks up. She is glad to see him. As he reaches her...

She holds up her wrist. Dangling from it, her turquoise bracelet
She wore her best for Jack. Quoyle stands very close. One last
thing from his pocket...

                          QUOYLE
                New Year's present.

A small box. Wrapped as careful as he could.     She looks to his
eyes, really?

                            QUOYLE
                Oh, yeh.    It's a Quoyle tradition.

Well, in that case. She takes it into her slender fingers. Undoes
the ribbon, the paper. Lifts the lid to see, resting in tissue...

...eggshells. Crushed almost to powder. Her heart comes straight
to her eyes, even before the whispered...

                              QUOYLE
                   Thanks.   For the mirror.

And across the room, Mrs. Buggit leans with trembling hands to fix
the Lodge pin to Jack's lapel. Shaking as she is, the hand
lurches, the big pin goes PLUNGING, and...

...a rattling COUGH. Rolls across this room. The world falls
silent. Jack's wife grabs her son's arm, and their eyes bug out,
staring into the box.

                             DENNIS
                   DAD'S COME BACK!

And LUNGES to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the
coffin's wedge. A sudden ROAR, there are SCREAMS, there is even
LAUGHTER and WHISTLING, complete chaos. And in the bedlam, a tug
on Quoyle's coat...

                              BUNNY
                   See.   He woke up.

EXT. OMALOOR BAY - DAY

Sunlit day of crystal perfection. The majesty of ice and towering
rock and shimmering water. A scale so majestic, any cynic would be
hard put to deny God's hand. And gliding into FRAME...

...a tiny skiff.     On its maiden run.   We CLOSE to see...

...painted on its side. THE FOUR WOMEN. One woman is rowing just
now, doing all the work. Her son sleeps in the bow. And in the
middle of the little boat...

...father and daughter. Are unpacking the picnic lunch.        There is
a lot of food. This could take awhile.

                             BUNNY
                   That's a funny thing to say.   For
                   the first thing he said.

                             QUOYLE
                   What? 'I'm keepin' m'damn lobster
                   license'?

Yeh.   That.

                              QUOYLE
                   Maybe he just said it. To make
                   your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard.
                   You think?

She keeps unpacking.      Her face quiet and serious.   Her thoughts her
own.

                           QUOYLE (very softly)
                 It's not fair, is it. That Jack
                 woke up. And Petal didn't.

And since he's said her thought aloud.      She tells him...

                              BUNNY
                 Well.     The world's not fair.     You
                 said.

She's not looking up.      But he knows she's listening.

                           QUOYLE
                 That's something the world is
                 always teaching us. And sometimes,
                 the learning comes later.

That gets through.    Both adults can see it.

                           QUOYLE (a murmur)
                 You taught me that.

Eyes resolutely down, she nods.      Remembers.

                           QUOYLE
                 You know. What we wait for?
                 It's like the main stem of this
                 boat. It gives us our shape.

Her brow furrows.    Doesn't understand that.

                           QUOYLE
                 See, I know why you saved a place
                 for Petal. All this time.

On this.   She looks up.     Her dad is smiling from his eyes.

                           QUOYLE
                 Cos I'm the daddy. And you learn
                 how to do. By watching me.

And...

                           QUOYLE
                 You just watched.     Better than
                 I knew.

Still holding Bunny's eyes. He beckons to the woman rowing.
C'mere, a second. So Wavey sets down her oars. Slides over.
And Quoyle whispers to his daughter...

                           QUOYLE
                 Watch this.

He leans his face. To Wavey's mouth. A kiss so tender, even a
child can't turn away. The moment lingers. And when it ends...

                           WAVEY
                 I'm thanking your daddy.     For all
                 my presents.

                           BUNNY
                 There was only two.

Wavey looks at this girl.

                           WAVEY
                 More than two. Everything I need.
                 Except...

Except.   She gathers all the courage it takes to say...

                           WAVEY
                 Except a necklace.

And waits. We can feel her heart pounding in her throat.       Bunny
stares back with eyes no one could read. And then...

                           BUNNY
                 I got a box of 'em.   You could
                 pick one.

A hush over this bay.   A woman stunned and grateful.

                           BUNNY
                 Then you'd have everything you need.

Well, that seems true. So, the woman nods.       Her eyes flutter down.
In the silence, she unwraps a sandwich...

                           WAVEY (a murmur)
                 You want the cheese?

                            BUNNY
                 No.

Okay, then. She hands that one to Quoyle.       And as she and Bunny
look for another, we PULL...

...UP and AWAY, an AERIAL ANGLE swirling above the shimmering bay.
The boat so far below us. The people tiny specks. They could be
anyone.

Anyone at all.

                                     SHREK
                         Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
 
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
               after the ogre.
 
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!

                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
                         thing can do to you?
 
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
                         bread.
 
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly 
                         peeled skin.
 
                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
                         quite good on toast.
 
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might 
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
                         to the ground.)
 
               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
                         After him!
 
                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
                         Turn!
 
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
               quickly hides behind Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
                         to place you both under arrest and transport 
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               begins walking back to his cottage.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, 
                         you was really, really, really somethin' 
                         back here. Incredible!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
                         around and Donkey is right in front 
                         of him.) Whoa!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
                         you that you that you was great back 
                         here? Those guards! They thought they 
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, 
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
                         like babes in the woods. That really 
                         made me feel good to see that.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, 
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses 
                         us.
 
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
               loudly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
                         work, your breath certainly will get 
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely 
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned 
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the 
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking 
                         out of my butt that day.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Why are you following me?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's 
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
                         faith...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
                         have any friends.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
                         cruelly honest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
                         me. What am I?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
                         tall?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your 
                         torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that 
                         bother you?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Nope.

                                     SHREK
                         Really?

                                     DONKEY
                         Really, really.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
                         thing. I like that. I respect that, 
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
                         in place like that?
 
                                     SHREK
                         That would be my home.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
                         You know you are quite a decorator. 
                         It's amazing what you've done with such 
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
                         don't entertain much, do you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         I like my privacy.

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing 
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when 
                         you got somebody in your face. You've 
                         trying to give them a hint, and they 
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I stay with you, please?

                                     SHREK
                         (sarcastically) Of course!

                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
                         You don't know what it's like to be 
                         considered a freak. (pause while he 
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
                         But that's why we gotta stick together. 
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.

                                     DONKEY
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
                         a chair.) No! No!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?

                                     SHREK
                         (irritated) Outside!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
                         I don't know you, and you don't know 
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you 
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
                         no one here beside me...
 
               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
               noise. He stands up with a huff.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
                         stay outside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (from the window) I am outside.

               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
 
                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
                         farm, but what choice do we have?
 
                         
                                     BLIND MOUSE2
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
 
                         
                                     GORDO
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
                         and lands on his shoulder.)
 
                                     GORDO
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
                         ear)
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ow!

                                     GORDO
                         Blah! Awful stuff.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Is that you, Gordo?

                                     GORDO
                         How did you know?

                                     SHREK
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
                         from behind and he drops the mice.) 
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.
 
                         
                                     DWARF
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The 
                         bed's taken.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Huh?

               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
               him.
 
                                     BIG BAD WOLF
                         What?

               TIME LAPSE

               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
               him to the front door.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and 
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy 
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
                         no. No! No!
 
               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)
 
                         
               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
               tent.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right, get out of here. All of you, 
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
                         look at Donkey)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
                         them.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         We were forced to come here.

                                     SHREK
                         (flabbergasted) By who?

                                     LITTLE PIG
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
                         this Farquaad guy is?
 
               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.

                                     SHREK
                         Does anyone else know where to find 
                         him? Anyone at all?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Me! Me!

                                     SHREK
                         Anyone?

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
                         Me, me!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
                         Your welcome is officially worn out. 
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
                         right now and get you all off my land 
                         and back where you came from! (Pause. 
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
                         You! You're comin' with me.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, that's what I like to hear, 
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
                         adventure. I love it!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it 
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
                         on the road again.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What did I say about singing?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I whistle?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I hum it?

                                     SHREK
                         All right, hum it.

               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

               DULOC - KITCHEN

               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.
 
                         
               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
                         and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
                         as fast as you can. You can't catch 
                         me. I'm the gingerbread man.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         You are a monster.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
                         and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
                         poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
                         me! Where are the others?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
                         eye.)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
                         Now my patience has reached its end! 
                         Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
                         pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
                         buttons.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         All right then. Who's hiding them?
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
                         muffin man?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
                         on Drury Lane?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Well, she's married to the muffin man.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         She's married to the muffin man.

               The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         My lord! We found it.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
                         it in.
 
               More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
               They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
               Mirror.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         (in awe) Ohhhh...

                         Magic mirror...

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks 
                         him up and dumps him into a trash can 
                         with a lid.) No!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
                         Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
                         of them all?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         Well, technically you're not a king.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a 
                         hand mirror and smashes it with his 
                         fist.) You were saying?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
                         But you can become one. All you have 
                         to do is marry a princess.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Go on.

                         (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back 
                         and relax, my lord, because it's time 
                         for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
                         And here they are! Bachelorette number 
                         one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
                         a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
                         and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
                         include cooking and cleaning for her 
                         two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
                         (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
                         number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
                         the land of fancy. Although she lives 
                         with seven other men, she's not easy. 
                         Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
                         find out what a live wire she is. Come 
                         on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
                         picture of Snow White) And last, but 
                         certainly not last, bachelorette number 
                         three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
                         castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
                         But don't let that cool you off. She's 
                         a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
                         and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
                         for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows 
                         picture of Princess Fiona) So will it 
                         be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
                         number two or bachelorette number three?

                         Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number 
                         three, my lord!

                         Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess 
                         Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
                         have to do is just find someone who 
                         can go...

                         But I probably should mention the little 
                         thing that happens at night.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll do it.

                         Yes, but after sunset...

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona 
                         my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
                         the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
                         your finest men. We're going to have 
                         a tournament. (smiles evilly)
 
               DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section

               Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
               lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But that's it. That's it right there. 
                         That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-huh. That's the place.

                                     SHREK
                         Do you think maybe he's compensating 
                         for something? (He laughs, but then 
                         groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
                         He continues walking through the parking 
                         lot.)

                         Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

                                     MAN
                         Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing 
                         a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
                         screams and begins running through the 
                         rows of rope to get to the front gate 
                         to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. 
                         Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
                         - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins 
                         walking straight through the rows. The 
                         attendant runs into a wall and falls 
                         down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
                         continue on into DuLoc.)
 
               DULOC

               They look around but all is quiet.

                                     SHREK
                         It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, look at this!

               Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
               marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
               open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
               to sing.
 
                                     WOODEN PEOPLE
                         Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
 
                         
               Here we have some rules

               Let us lay them down

               Don't make waves, stay in line

               And we'll get along fine

               DuLoc is perfect place

               Please keep off of the grass

               Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

               DuLoc is, DuLoc is

               DuLoc is perfect place.

               Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.

                                     DONKEY
                         Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready 
                         to run over and pull the lever again)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) 
                         No. No. No, no, no! No.
 
               They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Brave knights. You are the best and 
                         brightest in all the land. Today one 
                         of you shall prove himself...
 
               As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
               Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right. You're going the right way 
                         for a smacked bottom.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Sorry about that.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         That champion shall have the honor - 
                         - no, no - - the privilege to go forth 
                         and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
                         from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
                         for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
                         the first runner-up will take his place 
                         and so on and so forth. Some of you 
                         may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
                         to make. (cheers) Let the tournament 
                         begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is 
                         that? It's hideous!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (turns to look at Donkey and then back 
                         at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. 
                         It's just a donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
                         kills the ogre will be named champion! 
                         Have it him!
 
                                     MEN
                         Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps 
                         into a table where there are mugs of 
                         beer)
 
                                     CROWD
                         Go ahead! Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just 
                         settle this over a pint?
 
                                     CROWD
                         Kill the beast!

                                     SHREK
                         No? All right then. (drinks the beer) 
                         Come on!
 
               He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
               of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
               to say that Shrek kicks butt.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

               Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek 
               gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah!

               A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time 
               and sees him.
 
                                     WOMAN
                         The chair! Give him the chair!

               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men 
               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding 
               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you 
                         very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try 
                         the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
 
               The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on 
               Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Shall I give the order, sir?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         No, I have a better idea. People of 
                         DuLoc, I give you our champion!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Congratulations, ogre. You're won the 
                         honor of embarking on a great and noble 
                         quest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest 
                         to get my swamp back.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Your swamp?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those 
                         fairy tale creatures!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you 
                         a deal. Go on this quest for me, and 
                         I'll give you your swamp back.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Exactly the way it was?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         And the squatters?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         As good as gone.

                                     SHREK
                         What kind of quest?

               Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field 
               heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Let me get this straight. You're gonna 
                         go fight a dragon and rescue a princess 
                         just so Farquaad will give you back 
                         a swamp which you only don't have because 
                         he filled it full of freaks in the first 
                         place. Is that about right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, maybe there's a good reason 
                         donkeys shouldn't talk.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't get it. Why don't you just pull 
                         some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle 
                         him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds 
                         his bones to make your bread, the whole 
                         ogre trip.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have 
                         decapitated an entire village and put 
                         their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, 
                         cut open their spleen and drink their 
                         fluids. Does that sound good to you?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, no, not really, no.

                                     SHREK
                         For your information, there's a lot 
                         more to ogres than people think.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Example?

                                     SHREK
                         Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 
                         (he holds out his onion)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs the onion) They stink?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes - - No!

                                     DONKEY
                         They make you cry?

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     DONKEY
                         You leave them in the sun, they get 
                         all brown, start sproutin' little white 
                         hairs.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres 
                         have layers! Onions have layers. You 
                         get it? We both have layers. (he heaves 
                         a sigh and then walks off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both 
                         have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, 
                         not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody 
                         loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't care... what everyone likes. 
                         Ogres are not like cakes.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what else everybody likes? 
                         Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, 
                         you say, "Let's get some parfait," they 
                         say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? 
                         Parfaits are delicious.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! You dense, irritating, miniature 
                         beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! 
                         And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Parfaits may be the most delicious thing 
                         on the whole damn planet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, I think I preferred your humming.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Do you have a tissue or something? I'm 
                         making a mess. Just the word parfait 
                         make me start slobbering.
 
               They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
               a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
               to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
               so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
 
               DRAGON'S KEEP

               Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to 
               house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
                         You gotta warn somebody before you just 
                         crack one off. My mouth was open and 
                         everything.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd 
                         be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We 
                         must be getting close.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking 
                         about it's the brimstone. I know what 
                         I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It 
                         didn't come off no stone neither.
 
                         
               They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
               is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
               the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
               foreboding.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Sure, it's big enough, but look at the 
                         location. (laughs...then the laugh turns 
                         into a groan)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said 
                         ogres have layers?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, aye.

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, I have a bit of a confession to 
                         make. Donkeys don't have layers. We 
                         wear our fear right out there on our 
                         sleeves.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what I mean.

                                     SHREK
                         You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         No, I'm just a little uncomfortable 
                         about being on a rickety bridge over 
                         a boiling like of lava!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside 
                         ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll 
                         just tackle this thing together one 
                         little baby step at a time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Just keep moving. And don't look down.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. 
                         Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't 
                         look down. (he steps through a rotting 
                         board and ends up looking straight down 
                         into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! 
                         Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me 
                         off, please!
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you're already halfway.

                                     DONKEY
                         But I know that half is safe!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. 
                         You go back.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, no! Wait!

                                     SHREK
                         Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance 
                         then, shall me? (bounces and sways the 
                         bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't do that!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces 
                         the bridge again)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, that!

                                     SHREK
                         Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to 
                         bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across 
                         the bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

                                     SHREK
                         You said do it! I'm doin' it.

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, 
                         I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) 
                         Oh!
 
                                     SHREK
                         That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks 
                         towards the castle)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. So where is this fire-breathing 
                         pain-in-the-neck anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
                         (chuckles)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
 
                         
               INSIDE THE CASTLE

                                     DONKEY
                         You afraid?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         But...

                                     SHREK
                         Shh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton 
                         and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong 
                         with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 
                         response to an unfamiliar situation. 
                         Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might 
                         add. With a dragon that breathes fire 
                         and eats knights and breathes fire, 
                         it sure doesn't mean you're a coward 
                         if you're a little scared. I sure as 
                         heck ain't no coward. I know that.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. 
                         Now go over there and see if you can 
                         find any stairs.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (putting on a helmet) The princess will 
                         be up the stairs in the highest room 
                         in the tallest tower.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What makes you think she'll be there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I read it in a book once. (walks off)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle 
                         the stairs. I'll find those stairs. 
                         I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs 
                         won't know which way they're goin'. 
                         (walks off)
 
               EMPTY ROOM

               Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it 
                         to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm 
                         the stair master. I've mastered the 
                         stairs. I wish I had a step right here. 
                         I'd step all over it.
 
               ELSEWHERE

               Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.

                                     SHREK
                         Well, at least we know where the princess 
                         is, but where's the...
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Dragon!

               Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. 
               Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon 
               breathes fire.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, look out! (he manages to get 
                         a hold of the dragons tail and holds 
                         on) Got ya!
 
               The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek 
               goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the 
               tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying 
               on the floor.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Aah! Aah!

               Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small 
               part of the bridge he's on.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, 
                         what large teeth you have. (the dragon 
                         growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. 
                         I know you probably hear this all time 
                         from your food, but you must bleach, 
                         'cause that is one dazzling smile you 
                         got there. Do I detect a hint of minty 
                         freshness? And you know what else? You're 
                         - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! 
                         I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 
                         You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 
                         (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes 
                         at him) What's the matter with you? 
                         You got something in your eye? Ohh. 
                         Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, 
                         but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon 
                         blows a smoke ring in the shape of a 
                         heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm 
                         an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd 
                         work out if you're gonna blow smoke 
                         rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him 
                         up with her teeth and carries him off) 
                         No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
 
               FIONA'S ROOM

               Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona 
               so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She 
               then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off 
               the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. 
               Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for 
               a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders 
               and shakes her away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Oh! Oh!

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up!

                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         Are you Princess Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

                                     FIONA
                         But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our 
                         first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, 
                         romantic moment?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should 
                         sweep me off my feet out yonder window 
                         and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         You've had a lot of time to plan this, 
                         haven't you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) Mm-hmm.

               Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down 
               the hallway.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But we have to savor this moment! You 
                         could recite an epic poem for me. A 
                         ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I don't think so.

                                     FIONA
                         Can I at least know the name of my champion?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     FIONA
                         Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds 
                         out a handkerchief) I pray that you 
                         take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Thanks!

               Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.

                                     FIONA
                         (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         It's on my to-do list. Now come on! 
                         (takes off running and drags Fiona behind 
                         him.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         But this isn't right! You were meant 
                         to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. 
                         That's what all the other knights did.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, right before they burst into flame.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly 
                         stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek 
                         ignores her and heads for a wooden door 
                         off to the side.) Wait. Where are you 
                         going? The exit's over there.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I have to save my ass.

                                     FIONA
                         What kind of knight are you?

                                     SHREK
                         One of a kind. (opens the door into 
                         the throne room)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. 
                         I believe it's healthy to get to know 
                         someone over a long period of time. 
                         Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs 
                         worriedly) (we see him up close and 
                         from a distance as Shrek sneaks into 
                         the room) I don't want to rush into 
                         a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally 
                         ready for a commitment of, uh, this 
                         - - Magnitude really is the word I'm 
                         looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that 
                         is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what 
                         are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just 
                         back up a little and take this one step 
                         at a time. We really should get to know 
                         each other first as friends or pen pals. 
                         I'm on the road a lot, but I just love 
                         receiving cards - - I'd really love 
                         to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's 
                         my tail! That's my personal tail. You're 
                         gonna tear it off. I don't give permission 
                         - - What are you gonna do with that? 
                         Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. 
                         No, no, no. No! Oh!
 
               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings 
               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks 
               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. 
               He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps 
               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. 
               Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and 
               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto 
               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms 
               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey 
               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and 
               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hi, Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         It talks!

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's 
                         the trick.
 
               They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots 
               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a 
               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His 
               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles 
               off and walks lightly.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

               Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll 
                         take care of the dragon.
 
               Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the 
               castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping 
               chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that 
               is still around the dragons neck.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (echoing) Run!

               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot 
               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons 
               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on 
               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They 
               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look 
               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to 
               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the 
               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs 
               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a 
               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You 
                         did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. 
                         (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) 
                         You're - - You're wonderful. You're... 
                         (turns and sees Shrek fall down the 
                         hill and bump into Donkey) a little 
                         unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed 
                         is great, and thy heart is pure. I am 
                         eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears 
                         his throat.) And where would a brave 
                         knight be without his noble steed?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I hope you heard that. She called me 
                         a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         The battle is won. You may remove your 
                         helmet, good Sir Knight.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, no.

                                     FIONA
                         Why not?

                                     SHREK
                         I have helmet hair.

                                     FIONA
                         Please. I would'st look upon the face 
                         of my rescuer.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

                                     FIONA
                         But how will you kiss me?

                                     SHREK
                         What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the 
                         job description.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Maybe it's a perk.

                                     FIONA
                         No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know 
                         how it goes. A princess locked in a 
                         tower and beset by a dragon is rescued 
                         by a brave knight, and then they share 
                         true love's first kiss.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. 
                         Wait. You think that Shrek is you true 
                         love?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes.

               Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.

                                     DONKEY
                         You think Shrek is your true love!
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         What is so funny?

                                     SHREK
                         Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: 
                         Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. 
                         Now - - Now remove your helmet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look. I really don't think this is a 
                         good idea.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Just take off the helmet.

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not going to.

                                     FIONA
                         Take it off.

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FIONA
                         Now!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. 
                         (takes off his helmet)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You- - You're a- - an ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is 
                         all wrong. You're not supposed to be 
                         an ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Princess, I was sent to rescue you by 
                         Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who 
                         wants to marry you.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Then why didn't he come rescue me?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Good question. You should ask him that 
                         when we get there.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But I have to be rescued by my true 
                         love, not by some ogre and his- - his 
                         pet.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, so much for noble steed.

                                     SHREK
                         You're not making my job any easier.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. 
                         You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he 
                         wants to rescue me properly, I'll be 
                         waiting for him right here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all 
                         right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. 
                         (he swiftly picks her up and swings 
                         her over his shoulder like she was a 
                         sack of potatoes)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

                                     SHREK
                         Ya comin', Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm right behind ya.

                                     FIONA
                         Put me down, or you will suffer the 
                         consequences! This is not dignified! 
                         Put me down!
 
               WOODS

               A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just 
               hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, so here's another question. Say 
                         there's a woman that digs you, right, 
                         but you don't really like her that way. 
                         How do you let her down real easy so 
                         her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't 
                         get burned to a crisp and eaten?
 
                                     FIONA
                         You just tell her she's not your true 
                         love. Everyone knows what happens when 
                         you find your...(Shrek drops her on 
                         the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to 
                         DuLoc the better.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You're gonna love it there, Princess. 
                         It's beautiful!
 
                                     FIONA
                         And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? 
                         What's he like?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Let me put it this way, Princess. Men 
                         of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. 
                         (he and Donkey laugh)
 
               Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off 
               the dust and grime.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't know. There are those who think 
                         little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: 
                         Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're 
                         just jealous you can never measure up 
                         to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. 
                         But I'll let you do the "measuring" 
                         when you see him tomorrow.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow? 
                         It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop 
                         to make camp?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, that'll take longer. We can keep 
                         going.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But there's robbers in the woods.

                                     DONKEY
                         Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting 
                         to sound good.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything 
                         we're going to see in this forest.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I need to find somewhere to camp now!
 
                         
               Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.
 
               
               MOUNTAIN CLIFF

               Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves 
               a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! Over here.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, we can do better than that. I 
                         don't think this is fit for a princess.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         No, no, it's perfect. It just needs 
                         a few homey touches.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Homey touches? Like what? (he hears 
                         a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona 
                         who has torn the bark off of a tree.)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee 
                         good night. (goes into the cave and 
                         puts the bark door up behind her)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You want me to read you a bedtime story? 
                         I will.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (os) I said good night!

               Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the 
               boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona 
               still inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, What are you doing?

                                     SHREK
                         (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, 
                         come on. I was just kidding.
 
               LATER THAT NIGHT

               Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring 
               up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations 
               to Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, 
                         the only ogre to ever spit over three 
                         wheat fields.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future 
                         from these stars?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. 
                         They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, 
                         the Flatulent. You can guess what he's 
                         famous for.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I know you're making this up.

                                     SHREK
                         No, look. There he is, and there's the 
                         group of hunters running away from his 
                         stench.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little 
                         dots.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, Donkey, sometimes things are 
                         more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what 
                         we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Our swamp?

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, when we're through rescuing 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's 
                         no "our". There's just me and my swamp. 
                         The first thing I'm gonna do is build 
                         a ten-foot wall around my land.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real 
                         deep just now. You know what I think? 
                         I think this whole wall thing is just 
                         a way to keep somebody out.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, do ya think?

                                     DONKEY
                         Are you hidin' something?

                                     SHREK
                         Never mind, Donkey.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, this is another one of those onion 
                         things, isn't it?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, this is one of those drop-it and 
                         leave-it alone things.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Why don't you want to talk about it?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Why do you want to talk about it?

                                     DONKEY
                         Why are you blocking?

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not blocking.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, yes, you are.

                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm warning you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Who you trying to keep out?

                                     SHREK
                         Everyone! Okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. 
                         (grins)
 
               At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to 
               the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and 
                         walks over to the edge of the cliff 
                         and sits down)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What's your problem? What you got against 
                         the whole world anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look, I'm not the one with the problem, 
                         okay? It's the world that seems to have 
                         a problem with me. People take one look 
                         at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before 
                         they even know me. That's why I'm better 
                         off alone.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what? When we met, I didn't 
                         think you was just a big, stupid, ugly 
                         ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     DONKEY
                         So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small 
                         and Annoying.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny 
                         one, right there. That one there?
 
                         
               Fiona puts the door back.

                                     SHREK
                         That's the moon.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, okay.

               DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom

               The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays 
               in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic 
               Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, 
                         show her to me. Show me the princess.
 
                         
                                     MIRROR
                         Hmph.

               The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ah. Perfect.

               Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up 
               to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly 
               at her image in the mirror.
 
               MORNING

               Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey 
               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes 
               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along 
               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles 
               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too 
               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but 
               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona 
               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still 
               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking 
               in his sleep.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like 
                         it like that. Come on, baby. I said 
                         I like it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

                                     DONKEY
                         Huh? What?

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up.

                                     DONKEY
                         What? (stretches and yawns)

                                     FIONA
                         Good morning. Hm, how do you like your 
                         eggs?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good morning, Princess!

               Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.

                                     SHREK
                         What's all this about?

                                     FIONA
                         You know, we kind of got off to a bad 
                         start yesterday. I wanted to make it 
                         up to you. I mean, after all, you did 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, thanks.

               Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.

                                     FIONA
                         Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead 
                         of us. (walks off)
 
               LATER

               They are once again on their way. They are walking through the 
               forest. Shrek belches.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         What? It's a compliment. Better out 
                         than in, I always say. (laughs)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, it's no way to behave in front 
                         of a princess.
 
               Fiona belches

                                     FIONA
                         Thanks.

                                     DONKEY
                         She's as nasty as you are.

                                     SHREK
                         (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly 
                         what I expected.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people 
                         before you get to know them.
 
               She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly 
               from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into 
               a tree.
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         La liberte! Hey!

                                     SHREK
                         Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! 
                         And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses 
                         up her arm while Fiona pulls back in 
                         disgust)...beast.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! That's my princess! Go find you 
                         own!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a 
                         little busy here?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't 
                         know who you think you are!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please 
                         let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. 
                         (laughs)
 
               Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out 
               from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I steal from the rich and give to the 
                         needy.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He takes a wee percentage,

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty 
                         damsels, man, I'm good.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Break it down. I like an honest fight 
                         and a saucy little maid...
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What he's basically saying is he likes 
                         to get...
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush 
                         grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.
 
                         
                                     MERRY MEN
                         That's bad.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         When a beauty's with a beast it makes 
                         me awfully mad.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He's mad, he's really, really mad.
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I'll take my blade and ram it through 
                         your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 
                         'cause I'm about to start...
 
               There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and 
               knocks Robin Hood unconscious.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Man, that was annoying!

               Shrek looks at her in admiration.

                                     MERRY MAN
                         Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at 
                         Fiona but she ducks out of the way)
 
                         
               The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to 
               get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.
 
               
               Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and 
               then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is 
               a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in 
               mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, 
               and Fiona begins walking away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, shall we?

                                     SHREK
                         Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins 
                         walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, 
                         whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come 
                         from?
 
                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         That! Back there. That was amazing! 
                         Where did you learn that?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, 
                         uh, one has to learn these things in 
                         case there's a...(gasps and points) 
                         there's an arrow in your butt!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you 
                         look at that? (he goes to pull it out 
                         but flinches because it's tender)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so 
                         sorry.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (walking up) Why? What's wrong?

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek's hurt.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, 
                         Shrek's gonna die.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm 
                         too young for you to die. Keep you legs 
                         elevated. Turn your head and cough. 
                         Does anyone know the Heimlich?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help 
                         Shrek, run into the woods and find me 
                         a blue flower with red thorns.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on 
                         it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die 
                         Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay 
                         away from the light!

                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. 
                         (runs off)
 
                                     SHREK
                         What are the flowers for?

                                     FIONA
                         (like it's obvious) For getting rid 
                         of Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ah.

                                     FIONA
                         Now you hold still, and I'll yank this 
                         thing out. (gives the arrow a little 
                         pull)
 
                                     SHREK
                         (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the 
                         yankin'.
 
               As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and 
               Shrek keeps dodging her hands.
 
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         No, it's tender.

                                     FIONA
                         Now, hold on.

                                     SHREK
                         What you're doing is the opposite of 
                         help.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Don't move.

                                     SHREK
                         Look, time out.

                         Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his 
                         hand over her face to stop her from 
                         getting at the arrow) Okay. What do 
                         you propose we do?
 
               ELSEWHERE

               Donkey is still looking for the special flower.

                                     DONKEY
                         Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, 
                         red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. 
                         This would be so much easier if I wasn't

                         flower off a nearby bush that just happens

                         Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. 
                         (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just 
                         about...

                         Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall 
                         over with Fiona on top of him)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ahem.

                                     DONKEY
                         Look, if you wanted to be alone, all 
                         you had to do was ask. Okay?

                         Oh, come on! That's the last thing on 
                         my mind. The princess here was just- 
                         - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he 
                         turns to look at Fiona who holds up 
                         the arrow with a smile) Ow!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle) 
                         That's...is that blood?
 
               Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue 
               on their way.
 
               There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. 
               Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a 
               small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as 
               Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back 
               into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting 
               and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb 
               that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it 
               around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins 
               eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. 
               Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting 
               it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning 
               it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group 
               arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.
 
               WINDMILL

                         There it is, Princess. Your future awaits

                         That's DuLoc?

                                     DONKEY
                         Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks 
                         Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, 
                         which I think means he has a really...(Shrek 
                         steps on his hoof) Ow!

                         Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move 
                         on.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried 
                         about Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     FIONA
                         I mean, look at him. He doesn't look 
                         so good.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What are you talking about? I'm fine.

                         (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's 
                         what they always say, and then next 
                         thing you know, you're on your back. 
                         (pause) Dead.

                         You know, she's right. You look awful. 
                         Do you want to sit down?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I didn't want to say nothin', but I 
                         got this twinge in my neck, and when 
                         I turn my head like this, look, (turns 
                         his neck in a very sharp way until his 
                         head is completely sideways) Ow! See?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'll get the firewood.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't 
                         feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) 
                         I don't have any toes! I think I need 
                         a hug.
 
               SUNSET

               Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while 
               Fiona eats.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Mmm. This is good. This is really good. 
                         What is this?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

                                     FIONA
                         No kidding. Well, this is delicious.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, they're also great in stews. Now, 
                         I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean 
                         weed rat stew. (chuckles)
 
               Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs.

                                     FIONA
                         I guess I'll be dining a little differently 
                         tomorrow night.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp 
                         sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff 
                         for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare 
                         - - you name it.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I'd like that.

               They smiles at each other.

                                     SHREK
                         Um, Princess?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                                     SHREK
                         I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) 
                         Are you gonna eat that?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? 
                         Just look at that sunset.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's 
                         late. I-It's very late.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     DONKEY
                         Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on 
                         here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't 
                         you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. 
                         You know, I'd better go inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to 
                         be afraid of the dark, too, until - 
                         - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of 
                         the dark.
 
               Shrek sighs

                                     FIONA
                         Good night.

                                     SHREK
                         Good night.

               Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks 
               at Shrek with a new eye.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on

                                     DONKEY
                         I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm 
                         an animal, and I got instincts. And 
                         I know you two were diggin' on each 
                         other. I could feel it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You're crazy. I'm just bringing her 
                         back to Farquaad.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell 
                         the pheromones. Just go on in and tell 
                         her how you feel.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, 
                         even if I did tell her that, well, you 
                         know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause 
                         I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm 
                         - -

                         An ogre?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. An ogre.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'?

                                     SHREK
                         To get... move firewood. (sighs)

               Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already 
               is.
 
               TIME LAPSE

               Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is 
               nowhere to be seen.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, 
                         where are you? Princess?
 
               Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing 
                         no games.
 
               Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't 
               look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking 
               out.
 
                                     DONKEY

                                     FIONA
                         Donkey, I'm the princess.

                         Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to 
                         her stomach) Can you hear me?

               Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets 
               down.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? What happened to you? You're,

                         Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 
                         'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a

               OUTSIDE

               Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his 
               hand.

                         for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower 
                         and thought of you because it's pretty 
                         and - - well, I don't really like it, 
                         but I thought you might like it 'cause 
                         you're pretty. But I like you anyway.

                         Okay, here we go.
 
               He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey 
               and Fiona talking.

                         really, who can ever love a beast so 
                         hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" 
                         don't go together. That's why I can't

               Shrek steps back in shock.

               Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks 
               away.

               Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks 
               down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back 
               inside the windmill.
 
               MORNING

               Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still 
               awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.

                         runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek! 
                         Shrek, there's something I want...(she 
                         looks and sees the rising sun, and as

                         into a human.)

                                     FIONA
                         But I thought that wouldn't matter to 
                         you.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at 
                         him in shock. He looks past her and 
                         spots a group approaching.) Ah, right 
                         on time. Princess, I've brought you 
                         a little something.
 
               Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal 
               sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only 
               like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers 
               march by.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots 
                         the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? 
                         Couldn't have been the donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona.

                                     SHREK
                         As promised. Now hand it over.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece 
                         of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared 
                         out, as agreed. Take it and go before 
                         I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) 
                         Forgive me, Princess, for startling 
                         you, but you startled me, for I have 
                         never seen such a radiant beauty before. 
                         I'm Lord Farquaad.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad 
                         snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, 
                         for I was just saying a short... (Watches 
                         as Farquaad is lifted off his horse 
                         and set down in front of her. He comes 
                         to her waist.) farewell.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have 
                         to waste good manners on the ogre. It's 
                         not like it has feelings.
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, you're right. It doesn't.

               Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless 
                         Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. 
                         Will you be the perfect bride for the 
                         perfect groom?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would 
                         make - -
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start 
                         the plans, for tomorrow we wed!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get 
                         married today before the sun sets.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. 
                         The sooner, the better. There's so much 
                         to do! There's the caterer, the cake, 
                         the band, the guest list. Captain, round 
                         up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona 
                         on the back of his horse)
 
                                     FIONA
                         Fare-thee-well, ogre.

               Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches 
               them go.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting 
                         her get away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? So what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, there's something about her you 
                         don't know. Look, I talked to her last 
                         night, She's - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         I know you talked to her last night. 
                         You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if 
                         you two are such good friends, why don't 
                         you follow her home?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

                                     SHREK
                         I told you, didn't I? You're not coming 
                         home with me. I live alone! My swamp! 
                         Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! 
                         Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, 
                         talking donkeys!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But I thought - -

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! 
                         (stomps off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek.

               Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona 
               being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running 
               into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner 
               alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.
 
               SHREK'S HOME

               Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes 
               outside to investigate.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues 
                         with what he's doing.) What are you 
                         doing?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I would think, of all people, you would 
                         recognize a wall when you see one.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed 
                         to go around my swamp, not through it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         It is around your half. See that's your 
                         half, and this is my half.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! Your half. Hmm.

                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. 
                         I did half the work. I get half the 
                         booty. Now hand me that big old rock, 
                         the one that looks like your head.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Back off!

                                     DONKEY
                         No, you back off.

                                     SHREK
                         This is my swamp!

                                     DONKEY
                         Our swamp.

                                     SHREK
                         (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working 
                         with) Let go, Donkey!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You let go.

                                     SHREK
                         Stubborn jackass!

                                     DONKEY
                         Smelly ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks 
                         away)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through 
                         with you yet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I'm through with you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, 
                         "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now 
                         it's my turn! So you just shut up and 
                         pay attention! You are mean to me. You 
                         insult me and you don't appreciate anything 
                         that I do! You're always pushing me 
                         around or pushing me away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so 
                         bad, how come you came back?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Because that's what friends do! They 
                         forgive each other!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive 
                         you... for stabbin' me in the back! 
                         (goes into the outhouse and slams the 
                         door)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, 
                         onion boy, you're afraid of your own 
                         feelings.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Go away!

                                     DONKEY
                         There you are , doing it again just 
                         like you did to Fiona. All she ever 
                         do was like you, maybe even love you.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a 
                         hideous creature. I heard the two of 
                         you talking.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         She wasn't talkin' about you. She was 
                         talkin' about, uh, somebody else.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't 
                         talking about me? Well, then who was 
                         she talking about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. 
                         You don't wanna listen to me. Right? 
                         Right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) 
                         I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, that's what friends are for, right?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Right. Friends?

                                     DONKEY
                         Friends.

                                     SHREK
                         So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         What are you asking me for? Why don't 
                         you just go ask her?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The wedding! We'll never make it in 
                         time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's 
                         a will, there's a way and I have a way. 
                         (whistles)
 
               Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so 
               they can climb on.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
 
                         
               They both laugh.

                                     SHREK
                         Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a 
                         noogie)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, all right. Don't get all 
                         slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All 
                         right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't 
                         had a chance to install the seat belts 
                         yet.
 
               They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc.

               DULOC - CHURCH

               Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there. 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.
 
               
                                     PRIEST
                         People of DuLoc, we gather here today 
                         to bear witness to the union....
 
                                     FIONA
                         (eyeing the setting sun) Um-

                                     PRIEST
                         ...of our new king...

                                     FIONA
                         Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead 
                         to the "I do's"?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (chuckles and then motions to the priest 
                         to indulge Fiona) Go on.
 
               COURTYARD

               Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with 
               a boom. The guards all take off running.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. 
                         If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 
                         that? (she nods and goes after the guards) 
                         Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You 
                         wanna do this right, don't you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         (at the Church door) What are you talking 
                         about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         There's a line you gotta wait for. The 
                         preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or 
                         forever hold your peace." That's when 
                         you say, "I object!"
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't have time for this!

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen 
                         to me! Look, you love this woman, don't 
                         you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         You wanna hold her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes!

                                     DONKEY
                         (singing James Brown style) Then you 
                         got to, got to try a little tenderness. 
                         (normal) The chicks love that romantic 
                         crap!
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right! Cut it out. When does this 
                         guy say the line?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         We gotta check it out.

               INSIDE CHURCH

               As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the 
               windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.
 
                                     PRIEST
                         And so, by the power vested in me...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     SHREK
                         What do you see?

                                     DONKEY
                         The whole town's in there.

               Inside

                                     PRIEST
                         I now pronounce you husband and wife...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     DONKEY
                         They're at the altar.

               Inside

                                     PRIEST
                         ...king and queen.

               Outside

                                     DONKEY
                         Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, for the love of Pete!

               He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.
 
               
               INSIDE CHURCH

                                     SHREK
                         (running toward the alter) I object!
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Shrek?

               The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, now what does he want?

                                     SHREK
                         (to congregation as he reaches the front 
                         of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin' 
                         a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first 
                         of all. Very clean.
 
                                     FIONA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, it's rude enough being alive 
                         when no one wants you, but showing up 
                         uninvited to a wedding...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona! I need to talk to you.

                                     FIONA
                         Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little 
                         late for that, so if you'll excuse me 
                         - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you can't marry him.

                                     FIONA
                         And why not?

                                     SHREK
                         Because- - Because he's just marring 
                         you so he can be king.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         He's not your true love.

                                     FIONA
                         And what do you know about true love?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen 
                         in love with the princess! Oh, good 
                         Lord. (laughs)
 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The 
               whole congregation laughs.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         An ogre and a princess!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek, is this true?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, 
                         my love, we're but a kiss away from 
                         our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! 
                         (puckers his lips and leans toward her, 
                         but she pulls back.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looking at the setting sun) "By night 
                         one way, by day another." (to Shrek) 
                         I wanted to show you before.
 
               She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. 
               She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona 
                         smiles)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! 
                         I order you to get that out of my sight 
                         now! Get them! Get them both!
 
               The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights 
               them.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This 
                         marriage is binding, and that makes 
                         me king! See? See?
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, let go of me! Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Don't just stand there, you morons.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll make you regret the day we met. 
                         I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll 
                         beg for death to save you!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And 
                         as for you, my wife...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll have you locked back in that tower 
                         for the rest of your days! I'm king!
 
                         
               Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I will have order! I will have perfection! 
                         I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon 
                         show up and the dragon leans down and 
                         eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon 
                         here, and I'm not afraid to use it. 
                         (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on 
                         the edge!
 
               The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth 
               and falls to the ground.

                         Celebrity marriages. They never last, 
                         do they?
 
               The congregation cheers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Go ahead, Shrek.

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                                     SHREK
                         I - - I love you.

                                     FIONA
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I love you too.

               Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 
               'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.
 
               
                                     CONGREGATION
                         Aawww!

               Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted 
               up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around 
               her.
 
                                     WHISPERS
                         "Until you find true love's first kiss 
                         and then take love's true form. Take 
                         love's true form. Take love's true form."
 
                         
               Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell 
               and then is slowly lowered to the ground.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are 
                         you all right?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, 
                         yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed 
                         to be beautiful.
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you ARE beautiful.

               They smile at each other.

                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) I was hoping this would be 
                         a happy ending.
 
               Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...

               THE SWAMP

               ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm 
               a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek 
               and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting 
               carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet 
               which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end 
               up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet 
               instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now 
               has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona 
               walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over 
               singing the song.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         God bless us, every one.

                                     DONKEY
                         (as he's done singing and we fade to 
                         black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't 
                         breathe. I can't breathe.

          PAT SOLATANO stands in the middle of his room, his back to

           You didn't even know that I loved
           it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't
           appreciate it, or you, before."
          There is a knock at the door.

           MALE ORDERLY (O.S.)
           Come on. Time to go.

                          PAT
           I lost all that. I blew it. But you
           also blew it. We can get it back.
           We're gonna get it back. It's all
           gonna be better now. I'm better now
           and I hope you are, too. And I'm

                          GONNA APPRECIATE--"
          Another knock at the door. Pat ignores it.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Hey, I'll be there in a minute,
           okay?

           MALE ORDERLY (O.S.)
           Doctor's waiting. Let's go.

                          PAT

          See glimpses of Pat's room: mayonnaise jar filled with water,
          black trash bag strewn on the bed, handwritten sign taped to

          show he swallowed.

           much.

           And it was just the way I wanted
           it, but he cut it back too far. He
           cut this side back too far trying
           to even it up. I didn't tell him to
           do that. I said, "Just cut it the
           way you cut it...."

                          PAT
           Once you get in the right frame of
           mind, I think anything's possible.
           I think we get, we so often get
           caught in this state of negativity
           and it's a, it's a poison like
           nothing else.

           DR. TIMBERS
           ...technically, you can take him
           out against our recommendation,
           but you assume a lot of liability
           in the eyes of the court. And he's
           just getting used to the routine
           here.

                          DOLORES
           I don't want him to get used to the
           routine here. Eight months is
           already long enough.

           Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be
           fine.

          DANNY OPENS THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT AND GETS INTO THE CAR

           Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally
           meet you. Pat told me all about
           you, how God made you rich in
           character, and you're the mighty
           oak that holds the household
           together, and not to mention the
           lasagna you make on game day when
           the Birds play.

           Danny was in for assault because of
           crystal meth and alcohol.

                          DANNY
           Bad combination.

                          PAT
           Yeah. On top of an anxiety
           disorder.

                          DANNY
           That was when I was an X-ray
           technician with my ADD and my
           anxiety. I had a lot of access to
           medication and I took advantage of
           it. That's when my hair was long,
           too. But my hair only grew when I
           was older. When I was younger, my
           hair didn't grow because my
           brother...

                          (TO PAT)
           Remember I told you about my
           brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I
           couldn't get a Jheri curl because
           my hair didn't grow long enough. I
           was so jealous of my brother...

           Don't worry.

                          PAT
           Dad, I'm in there because of the
           court. That's the agreement that we
           made months ago. It was a plea
           bargain with the courts. The
           lawyer, he instructed me, he said
           that what we should plead that, and
           then I would serve eight months and
           then I'd get out.

           PAT SR.
           Yeah, no, I just--

                          DOLORES

          Mom told me. Outside.

                          DOLORES
          I did not. No, I didn't.

                          PAT
          You just told me outside, Mom, what
          are you talking about? Five minutes
          ago, we were walking up the stairs,
          you said, "Don't say anything, but
          Dad lost his job and he's
          bookmaking."

           PAT SR.
          Why, Dolores? Why did you say that
          to him? He has the wrong idea.

                          (TO PAT)
          Everything's fine, Patrick. I'm
          more concerned about you than
          anything else.

                          PAT
          Good, Dad. Good.

           PAT SR.
          Okay, the question, the big
          question, is what are you gonna do
          with yourself?

                          PAT
          What am I gonna do? I'm getting in
          shape, I'm getting trim, I'm
          getting really fit for Nikki. I'm
          gonna read Nikki's teaching
          syllabus and get my old job back.

           PAT SR.
          Nikki sold the house. She left.
          Didn't your mother tell you that?

                          PAT
          Let me tell you something. You
          don't know anything about my
          marriage, okay, Dad? All right? Our
          marriage...we're very, very much in
          love, okay? Just like you two.

           PAT SR.
          Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's
          not around anymore. Nikki left.

           what? Excelsior. Excelsior.

           PAT SR.
           What does that mean?

                          PAT
           It means you know what I'm gonna
           do, I'm gonna take all this
           negativity and use it as fuel and
           I'm gonna find a silver lining,
           that's what I'm gonna do. And
           that's no bullshit. That's no
           bullshit. That takes work and
           that's the truth.

                          PAT
           Yeah, about a week before the

           told them that my wife and the
           history guy were plotting against
           me by embezzling money from the
           local high school, which wasn't
           true. It was a delusion. And we
           later found out from the hospital
           that's because I'm, uh...

           ...undiagnosed bipolar.

           thinking brought on by severe
           stress, which rarely happens, thank
           God. And then the shower incident
           happened and that's when everything
           snapped, so I then realized that,
           oh, wow, I've been dealing with
           this my whole life. And without any
           supervision I've been doing it all
           on my own with no help and
           basically I've been white-knuckling

           or to the hospital? Hmm? So take
           your medication and if you do fine,
           we'll reduce them.

                          PAT
           Nikki's waiting for me to get in
           shape and get my life in order, and
           then she's gonna be with me. And
           that's better than any medication.

           35.

                         

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, there's a possibility, and I
           want you to be prepared for it,
           that she may not return. True love
           is about letting her go and seeing
           if she returns. In the meantime, if
           you listen to that song, I don't
           want you to fall apart. So get a
           strategy, okay? You need one.

                          PAT
           Let me say something, I gotta say
           something.

           DR. PATEL
           Okay.

                          PAT
           This is what I believe to be true.
           This is what I learned in the
           hospital. You have to do everything
           you can, you have to work your
           hardest, and if you do, if you stay
           positive, you have a shot at a
           silver lining.

           DR. PATEL
           Work on a strategy, okay?

                          PAT
           Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this
           party on Sunday night and it's like
           a real hoity-toity thing and his
           wife, Veronica's a real stickler
           for.... I don't know, my mom got
           this Gap outfit she wants me to
           wear, but I wanna wear a jersey
           that my brother, Jake, got me from
           the Eagles.

           DR. PATEL
           Which jersey?

                          PAT
           DeSean Jackson.

           DR. PATEL
           DeSean Jackson is the man.

                          PAT
           Well, that settles that.

          PAT STOPS AND TURNS.

                          PAT
           I gotta go, man.

                          RONNIE
           Why?

                          PAT
           I can't stay, come on. I made a
           mistake, I shouldn't have worn
           this.

                          RONNIE
           Dude, you're fine. I like that
           jersey. I wish I was wearing that
           jersey.

                          PAT
           I feel like an idiot.

                          RONNIE
           Are you comfortable?

                          PAT
           Veronica's not gonna like it.

                          RONNIE
           Get over here.

                          PAT
           Plus you got a tie on.

                          RONNIE
           Don't worry about it, you're the
           guest of honor. You come however
           you wanna come.

                          PAT
           Really?

                          RONNIE

                          (TO BABY)
           DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?
           (noticing Pat) Oh, you wore a
           jersey to dinner.

                          RONNIE
           Isn't it awesome?

                          VERONICA
           Not for dinner.

                          RONNIE
           Look, he got us flowers.

                          VERONICA
           Oh, that's sweet. (to Pat) That's
           sweet, Pat. That's lovely.

                          RONNIE

                          RONNIE
           Check this out. We just redid the
           whole thing.

                          PAT
           Wow!

          RONNIE LAUGHS.

          Tremendous. Tremendous.

                          RONNIE
          Isn't it great?

                          PAT
          Tremendous.

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of
          redoing it again.

                          PAT
          Why?

                          RONNIE
          Because.

                          PAT
          Gotta be making a lot of paper to
          do that.

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I
          can't complain.

                          PAT
          Isn't the market down, though?

                          RONNIE
          It is down, but you know, she wants
          more, so I'm giving her more, man.

                          PAT
          Hey, you know my dad lost his
          pension.

                          RONNIE
          I'm sorry, man.

                          PAT
          Yeah.

                          RONNIE
          A lot of people. My uncle, too.

                          PAT
          Really?

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, but you know what? No
          disrespect, it's not personal, but
          this is the time to strike.

          RONNIE GLANCES, LOOKING FOR VERONICA.

           You okay?

                          RONNIE

                          (WHISPERING)
           I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody.
           Listen to me. I feel like I'm
           getting crushed and--

                          PAT

                          (WHISPERING)
           Crushed by what?

                          RONNIE

                          (WHISPERING)
           Everything. The family, the baby,
           the job, the fucking dicks at work,
           and it's like, you know, like I'm
           trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches
           for his throat, mimicking trying to
           breath) you know, and, and, and I'm
           like...suffocating.

          RONNIE COVERS HIS FACE WITH ONE HAND.

                          PAT
           Holy shit.

                          RONNIE
           You can't be happy all the time.

                          PAT
           Who told you you can't be happy?

                          RONNIE
           It's all right. You just do your
           best, you have no choice.

                          PAT
           That's not true at all.

                          RONNIE

           I hope you're okay with Veronica's
           sister coming over. You okay with
           that?

                          PAT

                          RONNIE

           Tiffany and...Tommy?

           Yeah. Just Tiffany.

                          PAT
           What happened to Tommy?

                          RONNIE
           He died.

                          PAT
           Tommy died?

                          RONNIE
           Cops die.

                          PAT
           How'd he die?

                          RONNIE
           Please, don't bring it up.

                          PAT
           No, how did he die?

                          TIFFANY
           How did who die?

          PAT LOOKS UP TO SEE VERONICA'S SISTER TIFFANY ENTER: THEY
          LOCK EYES IMMEDIATELY. SHE IS TALL, STRIKING, INTENSE. She
          walks to Ronnie and Pat, who is unsure how to behave.

                          RONNIE
           Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my
           sister-in-law Tiffany.

                          PAT
           You look nice.

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

                          PAT
           I'm not flirting with you.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, I didn't think you were.

                          PAT
           I just see that you made an effort
           and I'm gonna be better with my
           wife, I'm working on that. I wanna
           acknowledge her beauty. I never
           used to do that. I do that now.
           `Cause we're gonna be better than
           ever...Nikki. Just practicing.
           How'd Tommy die?

          TIFFANY IS STUNNED. RONNIE CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT PAT JUST SAID.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What about your job?

                          TIFFANY
           I just got fired, actually.

                          PAT
           Oh, really? How?

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that
           happen?

                          TIFFANY
           Does it really matter?

           ...it's a drawer at a morgue where
           they pull out dead bodies and shoot
           them with formaldehyde.

                          VERONICA
           We have a port in every room. Gimme
           an iPod. Who, who doesn't have an
           iPod?

                          PAT
           Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't
           even have a phone. They won't let
           me make any calls. They think I'm
           gonna call Nikki.

                          RONNIE
           Don't worry about it. Don't focus
           on that.

                          PAT
           I would call Nikki.

                          RONNIE
           I'm actually gonna give you one of
           my iPods. I have an old one.

                          VERONICA
           Gimme your iPod.

          RONNIE HANDS AN IPOD TO VERONICA.

                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           Give it to me. Thank you, baby,
           thank you.

          VERONICA PLUGS THE IPOD INTO THE OUTLET.

                          TIFFANY
           Of all the rooms there are iPod
           ports in, I'm happy you brought us
           into the bathroom.

                          VERONICA
           Look, look, look.

           44.

                         

          MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY.

                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           I can play music for the baby in
           any room.

                          PAT
           Can you play "Ride the Lightning"
           by Metallica?

          VERONICA IS SPEECHLESS. RONNIE GRINS.

                         

          INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE/DINING ROOM - EVENING


                          RONNIE
           Pat was a history sub at the high
           school, Tiffany. Ask him about any
           president, he knows 'em all.

                          PAT
           Here's a fun fact. You know where
           the term "OK" comes from?

                          VERONICA
           No. No, I don't.

                          RONNIE
           Where?

                          PAT
           Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth
           president of the United States of
           America, is from Kinderhook, New
           York...

                          VERONICA
           Oh.

                          PAT
           ...and he was part of a club, a
           men's club, called Old Kinderhook.
           And if you were cool, you were in
           the club, they'd say, "That guy's
           OK." `Cause he was in the Old
           Kinderhooks.

                          RONNIE
           Really?

                          PAT
           Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

                          RONNIE
           That's interesting.

           45.

                         

                          VERONICA
          You know, Tiffany's been doing this
          dance thing for years and she's
          real good at it. She's gonna be
          competing at the Ben Franklin
          Hotel.

                          PAT
          Oh, really? My wife loves dance.
          Nikki loves dance.

                          TIFFANY
          Why do you have to talk about me
          like that?

                          VERONICA
          I'm just bragging about you. Can't
          I brag about my little sister?

                          TIFFANY
          Don't talk about me in the third
          person.

                          VERONICA
          Please, gimme a break.

                          TIFFANY
          I'm right here.

                          VERONICA
          Just be nice. Just be nice.

                          PAT
          Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.

                          TIFFANY
          Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

                          VERONICA
          I know. I know, I know.

                          TIFFANY

                          (TO PAT)
          What meds are you on?

                          PAT
          Me? None. I used to be on Lithium
          and Seroquel and Abilify, but I
          don't take them anymore, no. They
          make me foggy and they also make me
          bloated.

                          TIFFANY
          Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,
          but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so
          I stopped.

           46.

                         

                          PAT
           You ever take Klonopin?

                          TIFFANY
           Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.

                          PAT
           Right?

                          TIFFANY
           Jesus.

                          PAT
           It's like, "What? What day is it?"
           How about Trazodone?

                          TIFFANY
           Trazodone!

                         TIFFANY LAUGHS

                          PAT
           Oh, it flattens you out. I mean,
           you are done. It takes the light
           right out of your eyes.

                          TIFFANY
           God, I bet it does.

          VERONICA AND RONNIE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. TIFFANY STANDS UP.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           I'm tired. I wanna go.

                          VERONICA
           No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we
           haven't even finished the salad
           yet, or the duck. I made the Fire
           and Ice cake.

                          TIFFANY
           I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you
           gonna walk me home or what?

                          PAT
           You mean me?

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me
           home?

                          PAT
           You have poor social skills. You
           have a problem.

           47.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           I have a problem? You say more
           inappropriate things than
           appropriate things. You scare
           people.

                          PAT
           I tell the truth. But you're mean.

                          TIFFANY
           What? I'm not telling the truth?
          Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.

                          RONNIE
           Um, maybe I should drive them home
           separately?

                          VERONICA
           You can drive them both home. Now.

                          TIFFANY
           Stop talking about me in third
           person.

                          VERONICA
           You can take Tiffany home first.

                          TIFFANY
           You love it when I have problems.
           You love it, Von, because then you
           can be the good one. Just say it.

                          VERONICA
           No...

          PAT STANDS UP.

                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           ...I don't. I don't. I just wanted
           to have a nice, I just wanted to
           have a nice dinner.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, God.

                          VERONICA
           What is your problem?!

                          TIFFANY
           Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm
           tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come
           on, are you ready?
          Pat stands.

           48.

                         

                          VERONICA
           You really, you really wanna go
           right now?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes, I really wanna go! It's been
           great.

                          RONNIE
           Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!

                          TIFFANY
           Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the
           baby. Bye.

          PAT FOLLOWS TIFFANY.

                          RONNIE
           Sorry, man.

          PAT GIVES RONNIE AN "ALL GOOD" AND FOLLOWS TIFFANY OUT.

                         

          EXT. STREET - EVENING


          PAT AND TIFFANY WALK TOGETHER IN SILENCE.

                          TIFFANY
           This is me.

          TIFFANY AND PAT STOP, FACE EACH OTHER.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Listen, I haven't dated since
           before my marriage so I don't
           really remember how this works.

                          PAT
           How what works?

                          TIFFANY
           I saw the way you were looking at
           me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it,
           don't lie. We're not liars like
           they are. I live in the addition
           around back, which is completely
           separate from my parents' house, so
           there's no chance of them walking
           in on us. I hate the fact that you
           wore a football jersey to dinner
           because I hate football, but you
           can fuck me if you turn the lights
           off, okay?

          PAT IS MOMENTARILY SPEECHLESS.

           49.

                         

                          PAT
           How old are you?

                          TIFFANY
           Old enough to have a marriage end
           and not wind up in a mental
           hospital.

                          PAT
           Look, I had a really good time
           tonight and I think you're really
           pretty, but I'm married, okay?

          PAT HOLDS UP HIS HAND, DISPLAYING HIS WEDDING RING.

                          TIFFANY
           You're married? So am I.

          TIFFANY HOLDS UP HER HAND, DISPLAYING HER WEDDING RING.

                          PAT
           No, that's confusing. He's dead.

          TIFFANY LOOKS AS IF SHE HAS BEEN PUNCHED, SHE EMBRACES PAT.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Wait, what?

          TIFFANY STARTS TO CRY.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What's happening?

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Oh, my God. Hey.

          TIFFANY PUSHES PAT AWAY AND SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

          TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS TO HER RENOVATED GARAGE APARTMENT.

          LED ZEPPELIN'S "WHAT IS AND WHAT SHALL NEVER BE" STARTS TO

          PLAY ON SOUNDTRACK.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/KITCHEN - EVENING


          PAT ENTERS THROUGH THE BACK OF THE HOUSE, DEEPLY UNSETTLED.

          HE WALKS PAST DELORES IN THE KITCHEN.

                          DOLORES
           Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey,
           is that make-up on your shirt?

                          PAT
           I don't know, Mom.

           50.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING


          PAT IS WITH PAT SR. HE STANDS UP FROM HIS CHAIR.

           PAT SR.
           What happened over there?

          PAT BEELINES PAST PAT SR. TO THE STAIRCASE.

                          PAT
           When am I gonna get a phone?

           PAT SR.
           You'll get a phone in due time. (to
           Dolores) What happened?

          DOLORES ENTERS.

                          DOLORES
           Pat!

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - EVENING


          PAT REMOVES HIS JERSEY.
          LED ZEPPELIN CONTINUES alternately quiet and LOUD.

          PAT LIES ON HIS BED, RESTLESS. SUDDENLY HE IS FRANTICALLY

          SEARCHING THROUGH ATTIC BOXES AS IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT


          PAT WALKS OUT OF THE ATTIC. HE OPENS THE DOOR TO THE MASTER

          BEDROOM AND WALKS INTO THE ROOM. HE KNEELS DOWN NEXT TO

          DOLORES'S SIDE OF THE BED.

                          PAT

                          (WHISPERING)
           Mom!

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT


          DOLORES WAKES.

                          PAT

                          (WHISPERING)
           I can't find my wedding video. Mom,
           wake up.

                          DOLORES

                          (WHISPERING)
           What is it?

           51.

                         

                          PAT

                          (WHISPERING)
           Where's my wedding video?
          Led Zeppelin continues.

          PAT SR. WAKES, LOOKING AT THE ALARM CLOCK.

           PAT SR.
           It's after three o'clock! What are
           you doing?

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - NIGHT


          DOLORES AND PAT WALK INTO THE ATTIC.

                          PAT
           I looked in here, but this is all
           your sewing shit up here, for your
           sewing and everything. Did you put
           it up here?

          PAT STEPS TO AN OPEN CLOSET.

                          DOLORES
           What about in your father's study?

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT


                         

                         

           PAT SR.
           (shouts from bed)
           Don't go in my study.

                          PAT
           (shouts O.S.)
           Dad, not now!

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - NIGHT


          PAT'S HANDS AS HE RIFLES THROUGH STUFF ON THE CLOSET FLOOR.

                          PAT
           Would you put it in here? It makes

           That sounds like bullshit. Why'd
           you run by my house? Did our little
           conversation get you upset last
           night?

                          PAT
           Hey, this is my route, okay? Just
           back off.

                          TIFFANY
           This is my neighborhood. You just
           ran by my house.

                          PAT
           I like to run by myself, okay?

                          TIFFANY

           Hey, I like to run alone! Will you
           stop?

                          TIFFANY
           What?

                          PAT
           Okay? I'm running here!

                          TIFFANY
           Me too!

                          PAT
           Well then, why don't you run
           somewhere else? There's a fucking
           ton of roads to run in! What are
           you trying to do?

                          TIFFANY
           I like this road. This is my
           neighborhood.

           Hey!

          TIFFANY REAPPEARS FROM ANOTHER ALLEY BEHIND PAT.

           What the fuck?!

          TIFFANY STANDS UP.

                          TIFFANY
           I was a big slut, but I'm not
           anymore. There's always gonna be a
           part of me that's sloppy and dirty,
           but I like that, with all the other
           parts of myself. Can you say the
           same about yourself, fucker?! Can
           you forgive? Are you any good at
           that?

          INT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL'S OFFICE - DAY


           DR. PATEL
           You seemed to have trouble last
           night.

                          PAT
           Let me just set the record straight
           about last night. Hurting my mother
           was a mistake and I hate myself for
           it, and I hate my illness and I
           want to control it. My father, on
           the other hand, had no trouble
           slapping the shit out of me last
           night, which I did not return
           `cause I could've killed him and I
           didn't. He's sixty-five years old.
           You don't think I could've beat the
           shit out of him? I mean....

           DR. PATEL
           He was scared for your mother and
           you hurt him as well.

                          PAT
           Yes, last night was a mess. Okay?
           And I think he probably just tried
           to do his best.

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, you have to have a strategy. I
           told you earlier. You need to
           recognize these feelings coming to
           you, otherwise you will be sent
           back to Baltimore. So when you get
           these feelings, you need to get to
           a quieter place, and be at peace
           with yourself, however you can.

                          PAT
           Yeah, but that's easier said than
           done.

           DR. PATEL
           You have to do it. You have no
           choice. Excelsior.

                          PAT
           Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a
           letter I want you to give Nikki,
           okay?

           DR. PATEL
           No.

                          PAT
           Why?

           64.

                         

           DR. PATEL
          Because you have a restraining
          order.

                          PAT

                          (SIGHS)
          What good are you, man?

           DR. PATEL
          Why did you have this overwhelming
          urgency to see your wedding video
          last night?

                          PAT
          Oh, I don't know, because I'm
          married and I haven't seen my wife
          in eight and a half months?

           DR. PATEL
          Maybe you think that Nikki's not
          around and Tiffany's an attractive
          girl and if you get drawn towards
          Tiffany, you will spoil your
          chances of getting Nikki back to
          you?

                          PAT
          Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't
          think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki
          because Tiffany's a slut.

           DR. PATEL
          Why is she a slut?

                          PAT
          After the dinner at Ronnie's, she
          said, quote, "We can go to the back
          house and you can fuck me as long
          as we turn the lights out."
          Unquote. And she still wears her
          wedding ring. So she's a loyal,
          married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

           DR. PATEL
          Maybe she just needs a friend and
          she thought if she offers you sex,
          it will be easier for you to become
          friends with her.

                          PAT
          She said she's not a whore anymore,
          but she likes that part of herself
          along with all the other parts of
          herself and can I say the same?

           DR. PATEL
          Can you?

           65.

                         

                          PAT
           Is that....? You're asking me,
           you're really asking me that
           question?

           DR. PATEL
           Yes.

                          PAT
           With all my crazy sad shit? What,
           are you fucking nuts?

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, the silver lining thing is
           yours. I'm just giving back your
           words to you. This "crazy sad
           shit," as you call it, made you a
           happier, calmer person with a
           beautiful positive philosophy of
           going outdoors, working out, and
           reading books.

                          PAT
           No, not the books.

           DR. PATEL
           You said Nikki's friends with
           Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if
           you become friends with Tiffany,
           Nikki will think that you're a
           kind, generous, large-hearted
           person, who helps people in need,
           who is basically thriving. So if
           you help Tiffany, it will be good
           for you.

                          PAT
           How do you know when I run?

           66.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           I wanted to clarify something. I
           just want us to be friends.
           (Pat doesn't answer)
           Did you hear what I said?
           (Pat doesn't answer still)
           Why are you giving me such a hard
           time?

                          PAT
           No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

          PAT AND TIFFANY RUN ACROSS THE STREET TOWARD A SMALL DINER.

                          TIFFANY
           I don't know how to act with you

          TIFFANY IS MOMENTARILY TAKEN ABACK BY PAT'S PROPOSAL.

           Here you go.

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

          PAT LOOKS AT THE MENU. THE WAITRESS STANDS, WAITING.

                          PAT
           I'm gonna have a bowl of your
           Raisin Bran.

           Tea.

          THE WAITRESS TAKES THE MENUS FROM THEM AND WALKS AWAY.

                          WAITRESS

           You want to share this?

                          TIFFANY

                          PAT
           Why did you order tea?

          SHE EATS CEREAL.

                          TIFFANY

                          (CHEWING)
           Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

                          PAT
           I ordered Raisin Bran because I
           didn't want there to be any
           mistaking this for a date.

                          TIFFANY

                          (CHEWING)
           It can still be a date if you order
           Raisin Bran.

                          PAT
           It's not a date. So how's your
           thing going -- your dancing thing?

                          TIFFANY
           It's good. How's your restraining
           order?

                          PAT
           I wouldn't actually call the
           restraining order "my thing," but
           getting back with Nikki is, and
           I've been doing pretty well. Except
           for a minor incident at the
           doctor's office.

                          TIFFANY
           And the so-called incident with the
           weights.

                          PAT
           Yeah. That was a thing with my
           parents. I wish I could just
           explain it all in a letter to Nikki
           because it was minor and I could
           just explain it and let her know
           that I'm actually not out of
           control and that I'm actually doing
           really well.

          TIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT.

                          TIFFANY
           I can get a letter to Nikki. I see
           her sometimes with my sister.

          PAT CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING.

                          PAT
           It would be so amazing if you could
           get a letter to Nikki from me.

           69.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
          She's not into breaking the law,
          which this letter would definitely
          be doing.

                          PAT
          But you would do it?

                          TIFFANY
          I'd have to be careful. I'm already
          on thin ice with my family, you
          should hear how I lost my job.

                          PAT
          How did you lose your job?

                          TIFFANY
          By...having sex with everybody in
          the office.

                          PAT
          Everybody?

                          TIFFANY
          I was very depressed after Tommy
          died. It was a lot of people.

                          PAT
          We don't have to talk about it.

                          TIFFANY
          Thanks.

                          PAT
          How many were there?

                          TIFFANY
          Eleven.

                          PAT
          Wow.

                          TIFFANY
          I know.

                          PAT
          I'm not gonna talk about it
          anymore.

                          TIFFANY
          Okay.

                          PAT
          Can I ask you one more question?
          Were there any women?

           70.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          Yes.

                          PAT
          Really?

                          TIFFANY
          Yes.

                          PAT
          What was that like?

                          TIFFANY
          Hot.

                          PAT
          Jesus Christ. Was it like...older
          women, a sexy teacher who wants to

                         SEDUCE YOU--

                          TIFFANY
          Made me sit on her lap and do
          things? Yeah.

                          PAT
          What? You sat on her lap?

                          TIFFANY
          Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
          She told you what to do?

                          TIFFANY
          Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
          Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I
          talked like this. Made me feel like
          such a pervert. Maybe we should
          change the subject.

                          TIFFANY
          I don't mind it.

                          PAT
          You don't, do you.

                          TIFFANY
          No. But then people were getting
          into fights in the parking lot at
          work, and in the bathroom...and the
          boss called me in to his office and
          tried to pin it all on me. So I
          accused him of harassment and then
          they fired me, sent me home and put
          me on some meds.

           71.

                         

                          PAT
           I get it. The song that was playing
           when my wife...was in the shower
           with the history teacher...

                          TIFFANY
           I heard about that.

                          PAT
           ...it was my wedding song and when
           I hear it, I go kinda crazy.
           Sometimes I hear it when it's not
           even playing.

                          TIFFANY
           Wow.

                          PAT
           Yeah. So they put me on medication,
           which I feel ashamed of.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah.

                          PAT
           So I know.

                          TIFFANY
           You do.

                          PAT
           I just gotta get a strategy, you
           know?

                          TIFFANY
           Me too.

                          PAT
           We'd better get back to the letter.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, let's get back to the letter.

                          PAT
           What if you told Nikki when
           Veronica was in the bathroom?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes. Yes, that could work. I love
           that.

                          PAT
           Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and
           write the letter right now.

          PAT BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT OF THE BOOTH.

           72.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          Can I at least finish my tea?

                          PAT
          Wait, what?

                          TIFFANY
          My tea. Can I finish it?

                          PAT
          Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell
          Nikki about our dinner? Why would
          she do that? Was it a test?

                          TIFFANY
          I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

                          PAT
          Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a
          test. How did I do? I think I did
          pretty well.

                          TIFFANY
          Yeah, she said you were cool,
          basically.

                          PAT
          "Basically"? Was I some percentage
          not cool?

                          TIFFANY
          No, she said you were cool, but you
          know.

                          PAT
          No, I don't know.

                          TIFFANY
          Sort of how you are. It's fine,
          relax.

                          PAT
          What do you mean? How am I? What
          does that mean?

                          TIFFANY
          Sort of like me.

                          PAT
          "Sort of like you"? I hope to God
          she didn't tell Nikki that.

                          TIFFANY
          Why?

           73.

                         

                          PAT
           Because, it's just not right,
           lumping you and I together, I mean,
           it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't
           like that. Especially after all the
           shit you just told me.

                          TIFFANY
           You think that I'm crazier than
           you.

                          PAT

                          (SCOFFS) (CHUCKLING)
           Because, well, we're different, I

                          MEAN--

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me.
           You know what? Forget I offered to
           help you. Forget the entire fucking
           idea. `Cause that must have been
           fucking crazy because I am so much
           crazier than you.

                          PAT
           Keep your voice down.

                          TIFFANY
           I'm just the crazy slut with a dead
           husband!

          PEDESTRIANS (low and indistinct chatter - continues under

                          PAT
           Hey, come on. Look, I don't think
           you're crazy, all right?

          PAT HURRIES TO TIFFANY.

                          TIFFANY
           Yes, you do.

                          PAT
           No, I don't.

                          PAT
           Can I just explain myself, please?
           I didn't want Nikki to think that I
           was associated with that kind of
           sexual behavior because I've never
           done anything like that, okay?

                          TIFFANY
           You may not have experienced the
           shit that I did. But you loved
           hearing about it, didn't you? You
           are afraid to be alive, you're
           afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.
           You're a conformist. You're a liar.
           I opened up to you and you judged
           me. You are an asshole. You are an
           asshole!

          TIFFANY GRABS PAT'S JACKET COLLAR.

           OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D)
           Are you being a punk on Halloween
           with these kids? You wanna go back
           to Baltimore? Is that what you
           wanna do?

           I didn't, I didn't, I didn't--
          TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens.

                          TIFFANY
           It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and
           Officer Keogh]. He didn't do
           anything, it was all the kids.
          Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           (walks crowd back)
           Let's go, clear out, nothing going
           on here.

          AS -- TIFFANY LEANS IN CLOSE TO PAT WHO IS UPSET, SONG
          PLAYING IN HIS HEAD. Tormented.

                          TIFFANY
           You gonna go your whole life scared
           of that song? It's just a song.
           Don't make it a monster.
          She leans close to Pat's downcast face.

           77.

                         

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           There's no song playing. There's
           no song. Breathe, count backwards
           from ten. That's it.
          Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops.
          Tiffany's face stays close to his.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's it. There you go. I'm sorry.
           I'm sorry.

                          PAT
           I'm sorry.

                          TIFFANY
           I took it too far.

                          PAT
           I'm sorry.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           (pulls her away)
           Hey, is he messing with you?

                          TIFFANY
           No, no. No, this was just a joke.
           This is a joke I started.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           There's a restraining order on this
           guy.

                          TIFFANY
           I know, I have a stupid sense of
           humor.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           That's not a good thing to do.

                          TIFFANY
           Well, I'm fucked up. What can I
           tell you? I'm sorry.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           You're Tommy's widow, right?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow,
           minus the whore thing for the most
           part.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           You're a funny girl. You wanna get
           a drink sometime?

          TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS AWAY.

           She doesn't, she doesn't do that
           anymore.

                          PAT
           I'm sorry about what I said in the
           diner.

                          TIFFANY
           I know. I know you didn't mean it.

                          PAT
           I didn't mean it at all.

                          TIFFANY
           I know, you say shit you don't mean
           all the time.

                          PAT
           All the time.

                          TIFFANY
           I'll still give your letter to
           Nikki, don't worry.
          TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her
          go.

                          PAT
           Wow. I really appreciate that,
           Tiffany.

                          (WALKING AWAY)
           I know you do.

           You do?

           Yeah, sure.

                          RANDY
           I'll bet I know what happened if
           only one is missing. Either Dolores
           or Pat needed an envelope and one
           of `em took it. That's the only
           answer.

           PAT SR.
           No, no, no.

          DOLORES, PREPARING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Dolores, somebody was in my study.
           Who took one of my envelopes?
           Somebody took an envelope.

                          DOLORES
           Maybe we should call the FBI.

           PAT SR.
           Don't make fun. This is serious.
           What FBI? Come on, let's take a
           look. I'll show you what this is.
           I'm gonna just explain to you
           something. I mean, you know what
           I'm doing, honey. This everything,
           like this. I got this, it all
           corresponds.

          PAT ENTERS.

                          PAT
           Dad, I borrowed one of your
           envelopes. I hope that's not a

                          PROBLEM

           PAT SR.
           No, it's not okay. It's not okay.
           You gotta ask.

                          DOLORES
           "Do not go in my study or I will
           eat you!"

                         RANDY LAUGHS

           PAT SR.
           It's not funny, it's not funny.
           What's everybody making a joke out
           of this for?

          Dolores, you are so beautiful!

           PAT SR.

                          (TO RANDY)
          Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop,
          stop, stop!

                          (TO PAT)
          Listen, a lot of envelopes go in
          and out of my office every day
          after games with a lot of cash in
          `em. So show some respect for what
          I do.

                          PAT
          Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four.
          I just wanted to tell you the
          number.

           PAT SR.
          Thank you.

                          PAT
          But the envelope was empty. I'm
          sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't
          want to wake you, but I needed an
          envelope.

           PAT SR.
          You didn't want to wake me? (to
          Dolores and Randy) He didn't want
          to wake me. He doesn't have a
          problem complaining about Ernest
          fucking Hemingway. He doesn't have
          a problem asking for his wedding

          Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come

          homemades. Come on, Dad!

          He's very happy.

                          PAT
          I'm happy.

          Isn't that a good thing?

           PAT SR.
          You're just up, up, up. I don't
          know what that is. Are you taking
          the proper dosage of your
          medication?

                          PAT
          Am I taking the right dose? Of
          course I am.

           PAT SR.
          Okay. Taking a little bit too many
          or something?

                          PAT
          No, if I was taking that, I'd be on
          the floor, Dad.

           PAT SR.
          Just stay with us. Stay for the
          game. Spend some family time.

                          PAT
          Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to
          go.

           PAT SR.
          Spend family time.

           Guys, I'm beating the song! I'm on

           Tiffany!

          PAT PUSHES THE DOORBELL.

          TIFFANY'S MOTHER OPENS THE FRONT DOOR.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany
           here?

                          TIFFANY'S MOTHER
           What do you want with her?

          TIFFANY'S FATHER APPEARS.

                          TIFFANY'S FATHER
           Is that another creep? What do you
           want, creep? Just beat it.

                          PAT
           Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.

          PAT HOLDS UP HIS HAND, POINTING TO HIS WEDDING RING.

          A CAR PARKS AT THE CURB IN BG.

                          TIFFANY'S FATHER
           Oh, great, a married creep.

                          PAT
           I'm her friend.

          ANOTHER MAN, JORDIE, JOGS UP TO THE PORCH, BEHIND PAT.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           We go running. Have you guys not
           seen us? I took her to the diner.

           Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is
           Tiffany home?

                          TIFFANY'S MOTHER
           Go away.

                          JORDIE
           I know her. I know her, we've
           dated. We still date.

                          PAT
           What are you doing here?

                          JORDIE
           I've called her, I've texted her.

           Do you know this guy?

                          JORDIE
           I still haven't heard back. We used
           to work together--

                          TIFFANY'S FATHER
           Just get the hell out of here...

          JORDIE'S HAND, HOLDING OUT A BUSINESS CARD.

                          JORDIE
           I just wanted to give you my card
           to give to her.

                          TIFFANY'S FATHER
           Another rude creep.

                          PAT
           Listen to what he's saying. Listen
           to what he's saying.

                          JORDIE
           What's he saying?

                          PAT
           He's saying you're being rude.

           --it's not because they got a
           broken wing, and they're hurt, and
           they're an easy target. And in this
           case, in this particular case, I
           think that wing is being fixed.

                         

          EXT. MAXWELL HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - DAY


                          PAT
           And you gotta make sure it gets
           mended. And you're gettin' in the
           way of that right now, okay?
           Because she's sensitive and she's
           smart, she's artistic. This is a
           great girl and you gotta be
           respectful of that. Come on.

          PAT TURNS AND LEADS JORDIE BACK TO HIS CAR.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Let me walk you down to your car.
           You're a better guy than this. I

           Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are
           you doing? What happened? How come
           you weren't outside? What the
           hell's going on?

          THEY STOP, FACING EACH OTHER.

                          TIFFANY
           I can't, I can't do it.

                          PAT
           What do you mean, you can't do it?
           You can't do what?

                          TIFFANY
           I can't give the letter to Nikki.

                          PAT
           Tiffany, what are you talking
           about? What do you mean you can't
           give the letter to Nikki?

                          TIFFANY
           Because what am I getting in
           return? What are you doing for me?

                          PAT
           You said! You said if I wrote a
           letter, you'd get it to Nikki.

                          TIFFANY
           I know.

                          PAT
           That was the set-up.

                          TIFFANY
           Because I do this time after time
           after time, I do all this shit for
           other people and then I wake up
           and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!

                          PAT
           What are you talking about? You
           seem like you're a tough girl to
           me. Why don't you just do things on
           your own?

                          TIFFANY
           I always get myself in these
           fucking situations. I give
           everything to other people and
           nobody ever, I never -- I don't get
           what I want, okay? I'm not my
           sister.
          Pat takes this in.

                          PAT
           Alright, well, ask for you. What
           can I do for you?

                          TIFFANY
           I can't do it.

           There's this thing.

                          PAT
           There's a thing, okay. What kind of
           thing?

                          TIFFANY
           It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a,
           it's a dance thing.

                          PAT
           It's a dance thing, all right.

                          TIFFANY
           It's a competition thing at the
           Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy
           would never do it with me and I
           missed it every single year.

                          PAT
           Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not

           Can we have one conversation

           goddamn husband is dead? My God.

                          PAT
           Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay,

           I took care of that jerkoff that

           What? Jordie?

           Let me ask you something. Do you

          TIFFANY STOPS.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           That encourages him, Tiffany. You
           shouldn't do it.

                          TIFFANY
           Couldn't you say the same about you

           What are you talking about? We're
           in love and we're married. It's
           completely different.

                          TIFFANY
           How are you in love? Tell me about
           that. The big Nikki love. Tell me
           about it, I wanna understand it.

                          PAT
           We have a very unconventional
           chemistry, it makes people feel
           awkward, but not me. She's the most
           beautiful woman I've ever been
           with.

                          TIFFANY
           Wow.

                          PAT
           It's electric between us, okay?
           Yeah, we wanna change each other,
           but that's normal, couples wanna do
           that, I want her to stop dressing
           like she dresses, I want her to
           stop acting so superior to me,
           okay? And she wanted me to lose
           weight and stop my mood swings,
           both of which I've done. I mean,
           people fight. Couples fight. We
           would fight, we wouldn't talk for a
           couple weeks. That's normal. She
           always wanted the best for me.
          Tiffany listens.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           She wanted me to be passionate and
           compassionate. And that's a good
           thing. You know? I just, look, I'm
           my best self today, and I think
           she's her best self today, and our
           love's gonna be fucking amazing.

                          TIFFANY
           It's gonna be amazing, and you're
           gonna be amazing, and she's gonna
           be amazing, and you're not gonna be
           that guy that's gonna take
           advantage of a situation without
           offering to do something back. So
           think about the dance thing.

           Pat, you're up to something, I
           know.

                          PAT
           People like Tiffany, or Danny, or
           me, maybe we know something that
           you guys don't know, okay? Did you
           ever think about that? Maybe we
           understand something because we're

           We have a sixth sense. I mean,
           everybody's got it. Everybody's
           just not in touch with it.

           Oh, no.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           How you doing, Pat?

                          PAT
           Jesus.

           PAT SR.
           I guess his sixth sense forgot to
           tell him the cops were coming.

                          OFFICER KEOGH

                          (RE: DANNY)
           I'm taking him back to the
           hospital.

                          PAT
           What? No, no, he passed his thing,

           First of all, check with the latest
           legal development.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           Well, we got a call that they did
           convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law
           admission status by the deadline of
           your sentence, so....

           PAT SR.

                          (TO KEOGH)
           Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles
           fan or are you not an Eagles fan?

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           I'm an Eagles fan.

           PAT SR.
           Well then, what's the problem? He's
           not goin' anywhere. Just let him
           finish the game, that's all. The
           handkerchief is working. We're
           killing the Seahawks, twenty-seven-
           ten. What's the matter with you?
           Let him stay, please!

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           I don't know what the hell you're
           talking about "the handkerchief".
           And I'm glad that the Seahawks are
           losing and we're winning, but I
           gotta take Danny McDaniels back to
           Baltimore, alright? He can contest
           his case from Baltimore.

          DANNY STANDS UP.

                          DANNY
           Not correct about the Mental
           Hygiene Law. You're not correct.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           Come on.

          DANNY ENTERS R. AND OFFICER KEOGH GRABS HIS ARM. THE

          TIFFANY LEADS PAT INTO HER DANE STUDIO.

                          TIFFANY
           I used the insurance money to build
           this. I designed it. All the floors
           are hard oak. It has good bounce
           for dancers.

                          PAT
           Wow.

                          TIFFANY
           I'm not that great of a dancer, but
           who cares? It's therapy and it's
           fun. And the walls are good `cause
           I can play music really loud
           without anybody hearing.

                          PAT
           Where do you sleep?

          TIFFANY GESTURES AT A STAIRCASE.

                          TIFFANY
           Upstairs. It's a garage, I just
           renovated it. You know, I was
           thinking about putting a ballet
           barre here.

                          PAT
           When are you gonna give it to her?

                          TIFFANY
           What?

                          PAT
           The letter to Nikki.

          PAT HOLDS UP THE ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY
           Probably tonight.

                          PAT
           Really?

           98.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna
           see her tonight.

                          PAT
           Oh, I actually changed the first
           paragraph. I did this thing about
           Shakespeare and how it's very

                          ROMANTIC-

                          TIFFANY
           Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
           -and that maybe in the future if
           she wanted to go dancing, I can be
           able to do that because of all the

                          TRAINING THAT--

                          TIFFANY

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           No, that's good, that's really
           good.

                          PAT
           I assume you're a good teacher.

          TIFFANY'S HAND TAKES THE ENVELOPE FROM PAT.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah. I mean, I hope so.

                          PAT
           Maybe you can teach us both, you
           know what I mean?

          TIFFANY EXITS AND PLACES THE ENVELOPE ON THE STAIRCASE.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           And I also mentioned how generous
           it is, what I'm doing for you.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.

                          PAT
           You know, being of service.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah.

                          PAT
           To your need.

                          TIFFANY
           Uh-huh.

           99.

                         

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           All right, let's start simple.
           Start at that corner, walk towards
           me. Walk across the room.
          Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.

                          PAT
           Can we do something else besides
           the dance deal?

                          TIFFANY
           Are you fucking kidding me?

                          PAT
           I'm good with a hammer. You want me
           to fix something?

                          TIFFANY
           A deal is a deal.

                          PAT
           I know. Okay. I was just suggesting
           that maybe there's a better
           scenario.

                          TIFFANY
           Why don't you walk towards me like
           I'm Nikki. And the only way to
           convey how much you've missed me is
           by your walk. By your slow walk.
           You can't talk.

                          PAT
           I'm not doing it.

                          TIFFANY
           Only walk. Do it.

                          PAT
           No. That's stupid.

                          TIFFANY
           No walk, no letter. Walk to me like
           I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm
           Nikki. Come on.

                          PAT
           (under his breath)
           You're not Nikki.

          PAT RELUCTANTLY WALKS.

                          TIFFANY
           Don't look up until you're halfway
           here.

          PAT WALKS SLOWLY. CAMERA TILTS UP ONTO HIS FACE AS HE KEEPS

          HIS HEAD DOWN.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's right.

          PAT WALKS TO HER.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Not yet.

          PAT AS HE STOPS FACE TO FACE WITH TIFFANY AND LOOKS HER IN

          THE EYES.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Yes. Do you feel that? That's
           emotion.

                          PAT
           I don't feel anything.

                          TIFFANY
           Has anybody ever told you how Tommy
           died?

                          PAT
           No.

                          TIFFANY
           We were married for three years and
           five days, and I loved him. But for
           the last couple months, I just
           wasn't into sex at all. It just
           felt like we were so different and
           I was depressed. Some of that is
           just me, some of it was he wanted
           me to have kids and I have a hard
           enough time taking care of myself.
           I don't think that makes me a
           criminal. Anyway one night after
           dinner, he drove to Victoria's
           Secret at King of Prussia Mall and
           got some lingerie to get something
           going. And on the way back, he
           stopped on 76 to help a guy with a
           flat tire and he got hit by a car
           and killed. And the Victoria's
           Secret box was still in the front
           seat. (pause) That's a feeling.

          PAT, VISIBLY UPSET, WATCHES AS TIFFANY TURNS TO HER IPOD. BOB

           Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna
           teach you the waltz step.

          TIFFANY POSITIONS PAT AND GESTURES FOR HIM TO DANCE. HE MOVES

           shell -- and whoever has the conch
           has the power and they can talk.
           And if you don't have the conch,
           then you don't have the power. And
           then there's a little chubby boy,
           and they call him Piggy and they're
           really mean, and then there's a
           murder. I mean, humanity is just
           nasty and there's no silver lining.

                          PAT
           Wow. That was a great synopsis. I
           still need to read it, though.

          A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Who's that?

          PAT OPENS THE DOOR.

           104.

                         

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What the....? (laughing) What are
           you doing here, man?

          DANNY WALKS INTO THE ROOM.

                          DANNY
           If one of your two supervising
           physicians loses their license,
           then your whole ajudication is
           thrown out.

                          PAT
           How'd you know we were here?

                          DANNY
           I went by your parents' house
           looking for you and they told me
           you was over here.

                          PAT
           Danny, this is Tiffany. (to
           Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.

                          TIFFANY
           Hello. Pat told me about you.

                          DANNY
           So is the girl, that you wrote
           about?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

                          TIFFANY
           What? He wrote about me? I'm "the
           girl"?

                          DANNY
           He wrote about you, all right.

                          TIFFANY
           What'd he say?

                          DANNY
           He said you guys was helping each
           other out and you were nice and had
           a mouth on you, that you were
           mouthy, but--

                          PAT
           Whoa, whoa, that's enough.

                          TIFFANY
           No, please, tell me more about what
           he said in the letter.

           105.

                         

                          PAT
           Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll
           just tell you. It was nothing. It
           was just a very general letter.

                          TIFFANY
           Cool.

                          DANNY
           (looks at Tiffany)
           She's fine.

                          PAT
           She is my friend with an "F."

                          DANNY
           A capital "F."

                          PAT
           For "friend."
          The three stand there awkwardly for a beat.

                          DANNY
           Hey, can I see what you guys are
           doing?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

                          TIFFANY
           Okay.

          SHE TURNS ON MUSIC: PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE SIDE BY SIDE.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           And then this goes into something
           else.

                          DANNY
           That's it?

                          PAT
           Why? What is it, what is it, what
           is it.

                          DANNY
           Can I say something? Do you mind?

                          TIFFANY
           No.

                          DANNY
           You sure?

                          PAT
           Just say it. Say it.

           106.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           No, please.

                          DANNY
           I think Pat, you should be facing
           Tiffany.

          DANNY STEPS TO PAT AND TIFFANY, REMOVING HIS JACKET.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Let me show you, Pat, let me show
           you what I mean. You gotta come at
           her with a little bit more soul,
           man.

          HE HANDS HIS JACKET TO PAT AND FACES TIFFANY.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO TIFFANY)
           You should move more hips.

          TIFFANY AND DANNY. PAT WATCHES, STANDING BEHIND DANNY.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO PAT)
           Just, just sort of come in, Pat,
           come in like this. And....

          DANNY DANCES, DEMONSTRATING.

                          PAT
           Okay.

                          DANNY
           Yeah. Can you move `em a little bit
           more? Yeah, that's it. Move `em a
           bit more.

          PAST DANNY, TO TIFFANY AS SHE DANCES. TIFFANY CHUCKLES

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           You could turn around, too, there's
           nothing wrong with that. Yeah.
           You're pretty good.

          TIFFANY, DANNY AND PAT AS THEY DANCE. ONE HAND ON HER WAIST.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (HUMS)
           Mm, yeah.

          PAT ENTERS, STEPPING BETWEEN DANNY AND TIFFANY.

                          PAT
           Okay, we got it, we got it.

           107.

                         

                          DANNY
           Okay. Okay.

          DANNY MOVES, EXITING. AS PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit
           more soul. Black it up, Pat.

                          PAT
           "Black it up"?

                          DANNY
           You know damn well what it means.

          TIFFANY LAUGHS.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute,
           wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an
           idea.

          CAMERA MOVES IN ON DANNY. CAMERA TILTS UP OVER DANNY AND

          TIFFANY AS THEY JUMP UP REPEATEDLY, HOLDING HANDS AND MOVING

          IN A CIRCLE.

          PAT WATCHES AS DANNY AND TIFFANY JUMP TOGETHER.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Come get some, Pat. Come get some.

          PAT BEGINS JUMPING WITH TIFFANY. CUT TO: DANNY WITH TIFFANY

          AGAIN.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle
           back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta
           move your junk.

          TIFFANY'S HIPS AS SHE DANCES. DANNY DANCES WITH HER. MUSIC

          STOPS.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           I gotta get out of here. I gotta go
           see this girl, Tanya. She lives on
           this side of town.

                          PAT
           Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.

                          DANNY
           Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there,
           man. I want you guys to win!

                          TIFFANY
           Bye!

           108.

                         

                          DANNY
           Excelsior, Pat!

                          PAT
           Excelsior!

                          DANNY
           That's my man.

          DANNY EXITS.

          TIFFANY AND PAT SMILE.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - MORNING


          PAT, ASLEEP IN BED.

          PAT SR. WALKS INTO THE ATTIC. HE SITS DOWN ON THE BED NEXT TO

          PAT.

          PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT'S SHOULDER.

           PAT SR.
           Hey. Patty.

          PAT WAKES.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Pat.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Patty. Where have you been? Huh?

          PAT GROANS.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           We got a serious situation on our
           hands, you know that.
          Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           We gotta beat the Giants if we
           wanna have a chance of getting into
           the division, any chance of playing
           in the playoffs. Do you realize
           that?

                          PAT
           I didn't realize that.

           109.

                         

           PAT SR.
           Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I
           mean, I think it would be wise if
           we spent father-son time, reading
           about the Eagles, talking about
           them, just to strengthen the good
           luck thing that you're in.

                          PAT
           Okay.

           PAT SR.
           Yeah?

                          PAT
           Right.

           PAT SR.
           Hmm?

          PAT SR. LOOKS AWAY.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           I just wanted to, maybe I didn't,
           spend enough time with you growing
           up. I spent too much time with your
           brother. It might have made you
           feel worse about your behavior, but
           I didn't know anything, I didn't
           know how to handle it. I mean,
           that's what all this Eagles stuff
           is about. It's about us, spending
           time now. I wanna do everything I
           can to help you get back on your
           feet. That's the whole point. Yeah.
           I wish you'd watch these games with
           me so we could talk, we could get
           into things. (inhales) So would
           you, would you just come downstairs
           and talk to me and Randy now?

          PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT'S CHEEK. PAT, MOVED, NODS.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING


          RANDY SITS AT THE TABLE, DRINKING COFFEE.

           PAT SR.
           Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

                          RANDY
           He's betting everything on the
           Giant game. Everything.

           110.

                         

                          RANDY (CONT'D)
           All the money that he needs for the
           restaurant, he's betting on the
           Giant game.

           PAT SR.
           Tell him why.

                          RANDY
           Because he believes in you.

                          PAT
           Is that true?

           PAT SR.
           I believe in you, Patty. I believe
           in you. I want you to know that. So
           I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.

          DOLORES STARES INTENSELY AT PAT.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           You understand?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

           PAT SR.
           Heavy. I want you to go to the game
           with your brother.

                          PAT
           You want me to go to the game with
           Jake?

           PAT SR.
           Of course I do.

                          JAKE
           Does he want me to go?

           PAT SR.
           Of course he wants you to go.

                          PAT
           He told you that?

           PAT SR.
           He told me, yes.

                          PAT
           Even with all his friends?

           PAT SR.
           With all his friends. He trusts
           you.

           111.

                         

                          PAT
           He's not embarrassed?

           PAT SR.
           No. I'd love to go to the game,
           too, but as you know, I'm banned
           from the stadium. `Cause I'd love
           to see us beat the Giants and take
           a lot of money from this asshole.

                          RANDY
           Listen, personally, I think it's a
           stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I
           think it's ridiculous to bet all
           that dough for the restaurant on a
           game.

           PAT SR.
           Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you
           heard what I said. It's like a
           family business, it's our family
           endeavor. We all stick together on
           this. That's how it works. That's a
           positive, positive vibe.

                          PAT
           I made a commitment to Tiffany
           about a project, and we have a very
           important part of it that we have
           to go over on Sunday, and it's good
           for me, Dad. It's making me
           disciplined and focused, and it's,
           it's--, I never would've thought
           this, but it's a good thing.

           PAT SR.
           What is this thing you're doing?

                          DOLORES
           Yeah, what is it? What is this
           project, hon?

                          PAT
           It's a dance thing, okay? There's
           nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.

          DOLORES STEPS TO PAT, KISSES HIS FOREHEAD.

                         

          INT. TIFFANY'S GARAGE/DANCE STUDIO - DAY


          TIFFANY AND PAT.

                          PAT
           Listen, I need to ask you
           something.

                          (MORE)

           112.

                         

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow can I spend half the day
           with you and half the day at the
           Eagles game?

                          TIFFANY
           I'm gonna pretend that you didn't
           just ask me that.

                          PAT
           Why?

                          TIFFANY
           These are the two days that you
           have promised me and that we have
           prepared to nail the big move. It's
           not ready yet. And we don't have a
           move yet.

                          PAT
           I know, but my dad opened up to me
           and it was really beautiful and I
           wanna be of service to him, okay?
           And he's worried that the juju from
           the Eagles is being fucked up and
           he's concerned that it's because
           I'm spending time with you.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

                          PAT
           No, you're not messing up the juju,
           but the juju is messed up because
           I'm not with him during the games.

                          TIFFANY
           Guess what?

                          PAT
           What?

                          TIFFANY
           Nikki replied to your letter.

          TIFFANY STEPS TO THE STAIRCASE, LIFTING AN ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           But you can't read it until after
           you nail the big move. Go.

          PAT SIGHS AS SHE TURNS SHARPLY, PLACES THE ENVELOPE ON THE

          STAIRCASE AGAIN. CUT TO:

          PAT BRACES HIMSELF AT FAR SIDE OF STUDIO TO CATCH TIFFANY'S

          BIG LEAP -- TIFFANY BRACES HERSELF TO RUN -- SHE RUNS --

          LEAPS -- THE FALL. THEY DO IT AGAIN, SAME RESULTS.

           113.

                         

                          PAT
           Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do
           anything else without reading
           Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--,
           it's in the back of my head. We
           don't almost have it, all right?

                          TIFFANY
           I just hope you can handle it.

                          PAT
           Thank you.

          TIFFANY PICKS UP THE ENVELOPE AND TURNS.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What was her energy when she gave
           it to you?

                          TIFFANY
           She was intrigued, excited, and a
           little scared.

                          PAT
           She was scared? About what? Did she
           tell you?

          PAT TAKES THE ENVELOPE.

          CAMERA TILTS DOWN ONTO HIS HANDS, OPENING THE ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY
           Try to stay positive.

          PAT'S HANDS UNFOLD THE TYPED LETTER.

                          PAT
           I'm just gonna read it out loud,
           okay? Because if she says anything
           that's, you know, is that too much
           to ask?

                          TIFFANY
           No.

          PAT LOOKS DOWN AT THE LETTER, READING SILENTLY.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           I thought you were gonna read it
           out loud.

                          PAT
           Okay. Sorry.

                          (READING)

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           "Dear Pat, It was very emotional
           for me to get your letter, as I'm
           sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
           you took the risk of discreetly
           getting it to me through Tiffany.
           This gives us a chance to
           communicate while I keep the
           restraining order until I feel
           safe. I must admit you sound
           terrific and I'm happy that you are
           feeling so positive and becoming a
           more loving and caring man, which I
           always knew you were. I was moved
           to read about `Excelsior' and your
           belief in happy endings. I am also
           moved by your act of love to read
           the books I have taught at the high
           school. I'm sorry you find them so
           negative, but I disagree. I think
           they are great works of art that
           reflect how hard life can be and
           they can also help kids prepare
           themselves for the hardness of
           life. In spite of all these
           positive developments, Pat, I have
           to say if it's me reading the
           signs, I need to see something to
           prove you are ready to resume our
           marriage. Otherwise I find myself
           thinking that we might both be
           better off moving on with our lives
           separately. Please don't react
           quickly to this, but take time to
           think about it. I'm glad you're
           doing so well. Love, Nikki."
          PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I think I'm done for today, okay?

                          TIFFANY
           (follows him to door)
           She said to show her something,
           Pat. This dance can be that
           something. You would have never
           done something like this in a
           million years. It shows all kinds
           of skills on so many different
           levels: focus, collaboration,
           discipline. It's romantic, like I
           said it would be. It's for her.

                          PAT
           (over his shoulder)
           Thanks for the letter. I'll see you
           tomorrow, okay?

           What kind of emergency?

                          PAT
           Well, I'm just doing this project
           with Tiffany and I wanted to tell
           her I'm not gonna be on time.

           PAT SR.
           Just don't make her an emergency,
           that crazy girl, you know?

           She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow
           Jake's phone. It's too bad you
           can't come in to the stadium, but I
           know you were kicked out, you know,
           for beating everybody up. Guess
           we're not that different, huh, Dad?

           gonna throw the marriage away.
           There's some kind of love there. I
           know, I used to see it.

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/LIVING ROOM- DAY


          PAT SR. STEPS IN.

           PAT SR.
           What'd you do?

          PAT, JAKE, DR. PATEL AND RONNIE WALK INTO THE ROOM.

           121.

                         

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           What happened?

                          PAT

                          DAD--

           PAT SR.

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           What the fuck happened?

                          PAT
           Dad.

          PAT. DR. PATEL, RONNIE AND JAKE STAND BEHIND HIM.

           PAT SR.
           The birds lose, I lose a fuckin'
           fortune, a fortune to Randy! What
           the fuck did you do?! You fucking
           lost it! I thought you said you had
           it together! You were solid!

                          PAT
           I am solid. I was solid at the
           game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid
           now.

           PAT SR.
           You fell apart! What are you
           fucking talking about?!

           DR. PATEL
           Your son was trying to--

           PAT SR.
           It's all fucking ruined now. It's
           all ruined.

                          PAT
           No, Dad!

          PAT SR. TURNS, REMOVING HIS JERSEY. PAT STEPS TOWARD HIM.

          PAT SR. AS HE STRUGGLES TO PULL HIS JERSEY OFF.

           PAT SR.

                          (YELLING)
           It's all fucking ruined now! It's
           all fucking ruined!

                          PAT
           No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!

           PAT SR.

                          (YELLING)
           It's all ruined, you little fucking
           shit!

           122.

                         

                          PAT
           No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking
           thing! Come on, Dad!

           PAT SR.

                          (YELLING)
           You loser! You loser!

          PAT SR. SHOVES PAT.

                          PAT

                          (EMOTIONAL)
           I'm not a loser.

           PAT SR.
           You fucking loser! You ruined
           everything!

           DR. PATEL
           He was defending his brother!

                         PAT CRIES

           PAT SR.
           You fucking idiot! You spike the
           ball on the one yard line, you
           fucking idiot!

          THE DOORBELL RINGS.

          DOLORES LOOKS AT THE FRONT DOOR.

          THE GROUP WATCHES AS TIFFANY WALKS INTO THE ROOM.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Who is this?! Who's this?!

          TIFFANY WALKS TO PAT.

                          TIFFANY
           We need to talk right now! When you
           make a serious commitment to
           somebody, it is not cool to not
           show up!

                          PAT
           Wait a second, I tried to call, my
           God, what's happening, I called--,
           but I tried to call you, Tiffany,

                          I--

           PAT SR.
           Who is this? What is this?

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, really?

           123.

                         

                          PAT
          Yes.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
          I told you I was gonna split my
          time with my dad and you, and my
          dad was pulling me in one
          direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--

                          TIFFANY
          Well, that sounds great, Pat.
          That's great for all of them, but
          all of them didn't make a
          commitment to me in return for my
          help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.

           PAT SR.
          What is this craziness with Tiffany
          Maxwell?

                          PAT
          There's no craziness. I told you
          who she was, I was doing this thing
          with her. We had a conversation!

           PAT SR.
          She's fucking nuts! When you
          started spending time with her, it
          all fell apart. This is the fucking
          reason right here.

                          TIFFANY
          You think I fucked up the Eagles'
          juju, don't you?

           PAT SR.
          Ever since, ever since he was with
          you, ever since--

                          TIFFANY

                          (INTERRUPTING)
          You think that I'm why today's
          happened?

           PAT SR.
          That's right, you are why today
          happened.

                          TIFFANY
          I'm the reason why today happened?

           PAT SR.
          I think so.

                          TIFFANY
          Let's talk about that.

           124.

                         

           PAT SR.
          Be my guest.

                          TIFFANY
          The first night that Pat and I met
          at my sister's, the Eagles beat the
          Forty Niners handily, forty to
          twenty-six. The second time we got
          together we went for a run and the
          Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to
          five in the NLCS.

                          JAKE
          She's right, Dad.

                          TIFFANY
          The next time we went for a run the
          Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-
          seven to fourteen.

                          PAT
          Wow.

                          TIFFANY
          The third time we got together we
          had Raisin Bran in the diner and
          the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in
          the fourth game of the World
          Series, ten to two.

                          PAT
          Oh, wow.

           PAT SR.
          Let me think about that. Wait a
          minute.

                          TIFFANY
          Well, why don't you think about
          when the Eagles beat the Seahawks,
          fourteen to seven.

           PAT SR.
          He was with you?

                          TIFFANY
          He was with me. We went for a run.

                          RONNIE
          Really? That's crazy.

           125.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           There have been no games since Pat
           and I have been rehearsing every
           day and if Pat had been with me
           like he was supposed to, he
           wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he
           wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the
           Eagles beat the New York Giants.

                          JAKE
           She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
           That's all right on all counts.

                          TIFFANY
           Does anybody here happen to know
           what the official motto of the
           state of New York is on the
           official seal of the State of New
           York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do
           you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look
           it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."

                          DOLORES
           Oh Pat.

                          TIFFANY
           Not that I give a fuck about
           football or about your
           superstitions, but if it's me
           reading the signs, I don't send the
           Eagles guy whose personal motto is
           "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants
           game, especially when he's already
           in a legal situation.

                          RONNIE
           Unbelievable.

                          PAT
           Wow. How did you know all that
           stuff?

                          TIFFANY
           I did my research.

          SHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS.

           PAT SR.
           Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

           PAT SR.
           I gotta rethink this whole thing. I
           didn't trust it before, but I gotta
           say, now I do.

           126.

                         

                          PAT
          Oh, now you like her, Dad?

           PAT SR.
          I have to say I do. Yup.

                          RANDY
          Patrizio, I feel terrible, you
          know? You made the bet, I won a lot
          of money, and now look, your whole
          family is in turmoil.

                          TIFFANY
          Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.
          You live for this shit. You've been
          betting against my father for
          years.

                          PAT
          Is that right?

                          TIFFANY
          You're twisting the knife right
          now. You get off on it!

                          RANDY
          That's bullshit! That's not true!
          Don't say that!

                          TIFFANY
          You get off on it! If not, then
          prove it. Prove it.

           PAT SR.
          Yeah, prove it, prove it!

                          RANDY
          How do you want me to prove it?

           PAT SR.
          How's he gonna prove it?

                          TIFFANY
          By giving them the chance to win
          back everything, double or nothing.

                          PAT
          No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

                          RANDY
          Double or nothing on the Bengals,
          next week? Is that what you're
          saying?

                          TIFFANY
          No.

           127.

                         
          She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Against the Cowboys.

          EVERYONE GASPS.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's your team isn't it, Randy?

                          PAT
           That's his team!

                          TIFFANY
           I know who his team is.

                          RANDY
           When is the game?

                          TIFFANY
           December twenty-eight, last game of
           the season.

                          PAT
           Oh, my God.

                          TIFFANY
           Same day as the Benjamin Franklin
           Pairs Open Freestyle Dance
           Competition.

                          DOLORES
           Oh God.

           PAT SR.
           Randy, I thought they were
           America's Team. Don't you believe
           in America's Team?

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in
           America's Team?

                          RANDY
           Yeah, I believe in America's Team
           but if I win that bet, I win your
           book, you're out of action, you get
           no restaurant, no nothing.

           PAT SR.
           I like it.

                          DOLORES
           No. No, Patrizio--

           128.

                         

           PAT SR.
          I believe in the Eagles, I believe
          in my son, I'll take the action.
          I'll take it.

                          PAT
          Dad!

                          DOLORES
          Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

           PAT SR.
          I have faith, I have faith.
          Excelsior belongs in this house--

                          PAT

                         DAD--

           PAT SR.
          --not in the State of New York. In
          this house.

                          PAT
          Dad, listen to me. I didn't know
          that "Excelsior" was the state
          motto of New York, okay?

           PAT SR.
          I didn't know, either, but now I
          know.

                          PAT
          I know, but listen to me, this is
          toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is
          toxic, you shouldn't be doing this,
          you shouldn't be doing--

           PAT SR.
          Randy, what do you say-- (to Pat)
          Be quiet, shut up. You already did
          enough. (to Randy) Randy, what do
          you say? My birds, Benjamin
          Franklin's team favored by one and
          a half points. I'll give you three
          more.

                          DOLORES
          Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't
          you take the bet!

           PAT SR.
          In fact, I'll give you ten points.

                          PAT
          No, Dad! Dad!

           129.

                         

                          JAKE
          Dad!

           PAT SR.
          You have to take that bet on the
          Cowboys.

                          RANDY
          Dolores, would you stop him?

                          JAKE
          Jesus!

           PAT SR.
          How could you not take that bet?
          Even with the ten points I give
          you, that's an insane spread to
          your advantage. Cowboys are
          cowards. And I'll bet you're such a
          coward, you won't take the ten.
          Plus, are you listening, plus
          whatever their score is at the
          dance thing. (to Tiffany) What's
          that? Tiffany, what's that?

                          PAT
          What? No, no, no, no.

                          RANDY
          You're crazy to give away that many
          points. That's ridiculous! I won't
          take that! However, wait a second.
          I do like the idea of a parlay.

                          DOLORES
          What? No parlay! No!

          No, don't do it. Don't do it.

                          RANDY
          Pat, how do they run this dance
          competition? I mean, how do they
          score it and everything?

                          PAT
          I don't know, I don't know how they
          fucking score! We're participating.
          We're not, we're not a part of it.
          There are people, this is a high-
          end dance contest. I don't know. Do
          not put it as part of the parlay,
          Randy. Don't--

           130.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           They go by the Philadelphia rules.
           Each dancer is scored on a scale of
           one to ten, ten being the highest.
           You have to average the four
           judges' scores.

                          RANDY
           Okay, score is from one to ten,
           right? And you guys are how good?

                          PAT
           We suck.

                          TIFFANY
           We don't suck. Pat's a beginner,
           I'm okay, we're happy just to be
           going there.

                          RANDY
           And how are the people you're
           competing against?

                          TIFFANY
           They're good. Some of them are
           professionals.

                          RANDY
           They're good? Better than you?
          Pause. Tiffany says nothing.

                          PAT
           A lot better.

                          RANDY
           A lot better. So if I was to say
           you only have to score five, I
           would be really very generous,
           right?

                          PAT
           No, no, that would be amazing if we
           got five. Let's not get away--

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, come on, we can get a five out
           of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a
           break!

                          PAT
           We can't get five!

           PAT SR.
           Give `em a five. Give `em a five.

           131.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          We can do a five.

                          PAT
          What are you talking about, Dad?
          You haven't even seen us dance!

                          RANDY
          That's the parlay.

           DR. PATEL
          Will somebody please explain to me
          the parlay? Please?

                          RONNIE
          You gotta win two bets or you lose
          the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to
          win, the birds gotta beat the
          Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta
          get at least a five at the dance.

           DR. PATEL
          That's very, very manic indeed.

                          RONNIE
          That's the parlay.

                          RANDY
          Shake on it.

                          PAT
          You know what? I'm not gonna be a
          part of this. (to Randy) Randy,
          Randy, you're a sickness. You're a
          fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.

                          TIFFANY
          Pat, you can't quit.

                          PAT
          I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

                          TIFFANY
          Pat, calm down. Thank about it.

                          PAT
          See you later.

                          TIFFANY

           the jaws of victory. There you go.

                          PAT
           What does that even mean, Dad? I'm
           not gonna make that, that, that
           connection that you're making with
           DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter
           anymore okay? Just because I have
           the fucking jersey on...I'm not
           gonna do it. I'm sorry.

                          TIFFANY
           You are not a stand up guy right
           now. If it's me reading the

           and now he won't do the dance and
           it was very constructive for him,
           and you ruined it.

                          TIFFANY
           There's only one way to get him to
           show.

           It's a white lie, what's that
           matter? That's no big deal. So it's
           a little lie.

                          TIFFANY
           There's no other way.

           PAT SR.
           You know, we gotta leave a trail of
           bread crumbs so that he can live
           his life without ruining it.

                          DOLORES
           No. I don't approve. You can't do
           it.

           PAT SR.
           Well, you know, I didn't approve
           when you called her and you told
           her where he was running, so she
           could ambush him. I didn't approve
           of that, but you did it anyway, so
           I'm doing this anyway. That's it.

                          TIFFANY
           We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be
           there.

           Yeah, who'd have thought, dancing?
          Tiffany reacts from afar, stung.

                          NIKKI
           You look incredible.

                          PAT
           Thank you.

                          NIKKI
           You lost a lot of weight.

                          PAT
           I've been reading your books and, I
           have a positive attitude. I'm on
           medication, I'm in therapy.

          PAT STEPS CLOSER, LEANING TOWARD NIKKI. WHISPERS INTIMATELY

          IN NIKKI'S EAR. SHE LISTENS AND NODS INTIMATELY, WARMLY.

          TIFFANY WATCHES, GRABBING HER COAT FROM VERONICA, AND WALKS

          AWAY.

           148.

                         

          INT. HOTEL/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - EVENING


          TIFFANY HURRIES TO THE STAIRCASE, PUTTING ON HER COAT. SHE

          RUNS ACROSS THE LOBBY.

                         

          EXT. HOTEL - EVENING


          TIFFANY AS SHE HURRIES OUT OF THE HOTEL DOORS. SHE STOPS,

          PUTTING ON HER OTHER SHOE, THEN WALKS.

                         

          INT. HOTEL/BALLROOM - EVENING


          PAT AS HE LEANS BACK. NIKKI AND PAT SMILE AT EACH OTHER.

          HE TURNS AND WALKS.

          PAT SR. PUSHING PAST RONNIE TO PAT.

                          PAT
           Where's Tiffany?

           PAT SR.
           She left.

                          PAT
           What do you mean, she left?

           PAT SR.
           She left. What do you think!

                          PAT
           Where is she?

           PAT SR.
           Let me tell you, I know you don't
           wanna listen to your father, I
           didn't listen to mine but I'm
           telling you, you gotta pay
           attention to the signs. When life
           reaches out with a moment like
           this, it's a sin if you don't reach
           back. I'm telling you, it's a sin
           if you don't reach back, and it'll
           haunt you for the rest of your days
           like a curse. You're facing a big
           challenge in your life right now,
           at this very moment, right here.
           That girl loves you, she really
           loves you. And I don't know if
           Nikki ever did, but she sure as
           hell doesn't love you right now.
           I'm telling you, don't fuck this
           up.

          PAT EMBRACES PAT SR.

                          PAT
           I love you, Dad.

          PAT KISSES HIM ON THE CHEEK AND RUNS OUT.

                         

          EXT. SIDEWALK - EVENING


          TIFFANY WALKS DOWN THE STREET, ALONE.

                          PAT

                          (YELLING)
           Hey!

          TIFFANY LOOKS OVER HER SHOULDER, TAKES OFF RUNNING. PAT RUNS
          AFTER HER. They turn a corner. He is chasing her, a reverse
          of their previous runs together. HE GRABS HER ARM AND SHE

          STOPS, TURNING.

                          TIFFANY

                          (UPSET)
           Would you just leave me alone?!

                          PAT
           Wait a second!

          HE PULLS A LETTER OUT.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I have one more letter for you to
           read, okay?

                          TIFFANY

                          (YELLING)
           What the fuck is the matter with
           you? Give it to her yourself!

                          PAT
           Let me say something. You don't
           ever have to see me again if you
           just read it, alright?

                          TIFFANY
           This is so fucked up.

                          PAT
           Yeah, just read it.

          TIFFANY UNFOLDS THE LETTER.

                          TIFFANY

                          (READING)
           "Dear Tiffany...
          SHE STOPS, surprised it is addressed to her.

           150.

                         

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)

                          (READING)
           "...I know you wrote the letter.
           (long pause) The only way you could
           meet my crazy...."

                          (RECITING)
           "...was by doing something crazy
           yourself. Thank you. I love you. I
           knew it the minute I met you. I'm
           sorry it took so long for me to
           catch up. I just got stuck. Pat." I
           wrote that a week ago.

                          TIFFANY
           You wrote that a week ago?

                          PAT
           Yes, I did.

                          TIFFANY
           You let me lie to you for a week?

                          PAT
           I was trying to be romantic.

                          TIFFANY
           You love me?

                          PAT
           Yeah, I do.

                          TIFFANY
           Okay.
          SHE LEANS FORWARD AND KISSES HIM, they kiss. Camera pulls
          away. Score comes in.

	FADE IN:



	CLOSE ON SAM BALDWIN



	A card: Chicago.



	He's in his thirties.  His neck is pinched into a crisp 

	dress shirt and tie.  His expression is vacant, faraway.

	A breeze blows but he doesn't react to it.  In the 

	distance the architecture of the Chicago skyline.



				 SAM

		   Mommy got sick and it happened 

		   just like that and there was 

		   nothing anybody would do.

			   (continued)



	And pull back to reveal:



	EXT. CHICAGO - A GRAVESITE - DAY



	Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.  Sam's hand is on 

	his shoulder.  As the mourners go past and each takes a 

	turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --



				 SAM

		    If we start asking why we'll go 

		    crazy.  So, rule number one.  

		    We don't ask why.



							CUT TO:



	CLOSE ON ANNIE REED



	Pretty, blonde, animated.  Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore 

	Orioles hat.



				 ANNIE

		    Why? I just want to know why? 

		    That's my first rule.  I always 

		    ask why.  Come on.  Tell me.  

		    C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --



	And pull back to reveal:



	EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - DAY



	Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy 

	named SETH.  They're carrying packing boxes into the 

	house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.  

	The same stunning architecture in the b.g.  They go up 

	the back wooden staircase to the house.



				 SETH

		    There's no why, Annie.  I'm 

		    just not up for it.  I never 

		    said I was.



				 ANNIE

		    Is there somebody else?



				 SETH

		    Nope.



				 ANNIE

		    You don't love me, is that it?



				 SETH

		    Nope.



	Follow them into:



	INT. KITCHEN - DUSK



	As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to 

	assemble them.



				 ANNIE

		    How about ... you're too 

		    narcissistic to commit to 

		    another human being in a long-

		    term way.



				 SETH

			   (agreeably)

		    That's good.



							CUT TO:



	INT. SAM'S CHICAGO TOWN HOUSE - DAY



	An attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are 

	stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a 

	months.  A number of friends and relatives talk quietly 

	in the living room beyond.  Sam stands alone by a window 

	that looks into the backyard.  We can see a garden of 

	flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife.



				 SUZY

		    Five minutes in the microwave.  

		    Any one of them, five minutes 

		    and done.  Ready to eat.  Do 

		    you know how to make juice?



				 SAM

		    Microwave.  Five minutes.



							CUT TO:



	ANNIE'S KITCHEN - SEVERAL DAYS LATER



	Packing boxes.  Seth is moving out.



				 ANNIE

		    You take the microwave?



				 SETH

		    What am I going to do with a 

		    microwave?



				 ANNIE

		    You turn it on, you open it and 

		    you stand in front of it for a 

		    very long time.



				 SETH

		    So you're angry.  Big deal.



							CUT TO:



	SAM'S OFFICE - DAY



	A large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-

	rise.  Lake Michigan out the window.  A large space with 

	several architects consulting, drafting, etc.  Sam is at 

	his desk, working.  An older colleague, ROB, comes over 

	to him.  Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind 

	but a little stuffy.



				 ROB

		    Young man, it's none of my 

		    business, but maybe you should 

		    talk to someone.  I myself 

		    have consulted a professional.  

		    I used to be up tight.



	On Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more 

	uptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out 

	of his shirt pocket and reads them off.



				 SAM

		    Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...

		    Loss of Spouse support groups...

		    Single parent discussion nights...

		    Parents without partners.

			   (starts riffling, angry)

		    Partners without parents.  

		    People who need people.  Guys 

		    who go into the woods, beat 

		    drums and bond.  Get a shrink.  

		    Hug a friend.  Hug yourself.



	He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring 

	at him.  Quickly they pretend they weren't paying 

	attention.  Someone whispers something to a client.



				 SAM

			   (continued)

		    Don't mind him.  He's the guy 

		    who just lost his wife.

			   (beat)

		    What I really think is we need 

		    a change.



				 ROB

		    Good idea.  Take a few weeks 

		    off, get some sun, take Jonah 

		    fishing --



				 SAM

			   (shaking his head no)

		    A real change.  New city.  

		    Someplace where every time I go 

		    around a corner I don't think 

		    of Maggie.



	And hold on Sam for a moment and--



							DISSOLVE:



	EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - DAY



	Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field.  It's a 

	gorgeous day for a game.  They high-five each other.



				 ROB (V.O.)

		    Where you going to go?



	And cut back to:



	INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY



	As Sam snaps out of it.



				 SAM

		    I was thinking about Seattle.



	INT. CHICAGO TRIBUNE - DAY



	The Living Section of the paper.  Annie is blowing her 

	nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her 

	boss, LAURIE JOHNSON.



				 LAURIE

		    Honey, he wasn't right for you.



				 ANNIE

			   (blowing her nose)

		    I know.



				 LAURIE

		    He wasn't even wrong for you, 

		    like cosmically wrong, so don't 

		    beat up on yourself for 

		    wasting...however long it was.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.

			   (blowing her nose 

			    again)



	She pours Annie a cup of hot water.  Annie pulls a 

	teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water.



				 LAURIE

		    Maybe you should see a shrink.



			         ANNIE

		    I want my money.



				 LAURIE

		    Go home for the weekend.



				 ANNIE

			   (after a beat)

		    That's what I'm going to do.  

		    I'm going to go home.

			   (she thinks about it)

		    I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm 

		    going back to Baltimore.

			   (she's giddy)

		    How does a blonde do a high-

		    five?



	She smacks herself in the head.



							CUT TO:



	O'HARE AIRPORT - DAY



	The X where walkway K crosses with walkway L.  Coming 

	down walkway K are Sam, Jonah, Suzy, Greg, their son 

	MACK, and several other friends.



	And coming down walkway L is Annie with Laurie and a 

	couple of FRIENDS from the paper, JUDITH and DIANE.



	They pass each other going in diagonal directions and 

	continue on.



	We stay with Sam's group:



				 JONAH

			   (to Mack)

		    Dad says I'm going to get used 

		    to it, but I don't think you 

		    can ever get used to a 

		    designated hitter.



	overlap:



				 SUZY

			   (to Sam)

		    Eventually, in a few months, 

		    you'll start seeing women, 

		    you'll meet someone.



				 SAM

		    Move on.  Right.  That's what 

		    I'm going to do.  In a few 

		    months, boom, I'll be fine, 

		    I'll just grow a new heart.



				 SUZY

		    I'm sorry --



				 GREG

		    Sam, she didn't mean --



	Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for 

	the Seattle plane.



				 SAM

		    I know, I know.

			   (emphatic)

		    Look, it doesn't happen twice.



							CUT TO:



	Annie's group, as they approach the gate for the 

	Baltimore plane.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm going to meet someone, 

		    someone nice and stable who 

		    wears a hat so he won't catch a 

		    cold, and I'm going to marry 

		    him and have three children 

		    and live happily ever after.  

		    I mean, I am not cut out for this 

		    --


				 DIANE

		    For what?



				 ANNIE

		    For life as we know it.



				 LAURIE

		    Just make sure he isn't fat 

		    like my Michael or you'll spend 

		    your whole life worrying he's 

		    going to drop dead.



				 JUDITH

		    God, you guys are so romantic.



				 ANNIE

		    Do you know how long romance 

		    lasts?

			   (she snaps her fingers)

		    That long.



				 DIANE

		    Steven still brings me flowers 

		    every Friday and we've been 

		    married 10 years.



				 LAURIE

			   (to Diane)

		    Honey, nobody wants to hear 

		    that.

			   (to Annie)

		    Here, darling, have some Tic 

		    Tacs.



	Kissing everyone.  Annie starts toward the plane, loaded 

	with stuff.



				 ANNIE

		    The next time you see me I am 

		    going to be incredibly happy.



	INT. PLANE - NIGHT



	Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the 

	runway.  He notices his father's distractedness, reaches 

	over and takes his hand.  Sam comes back into focus.



				 SAM

		    I'm your dad.  Don't ever 

		    forget that.  That's rule 

		    number two.

			   (beat)

		    It's you and me, kid.



	INT. PLANE - NIGHT



	Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the 

	runway.



				 ANNIE

			   (to herself)

		    I guess it's just us.



	She gulps.



	EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT



	The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for 

	instructions.



	And now they both start to take off.  In opposite 

	directions.



	And we pull back back back back as the planes take off, 

	one flying east, the other flying west.



	And further and further back as they soar into the air 

	and leave the frame.



	The night sky.



	Stars twinkle.



	And now tilt down to see the United States.  It looks 

	like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by 

	Saul Steinberg.



	A light goes on in Baltimore.



	A light goes on in Seattle.



	They are the only lights on the map.



	EXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE



	As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER 

	JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.  They're 

	carrying an armful of Christmas presents.  They're 

	walking toward the parking lot.



				 WALTER

		    The short one with black hair 

		    is your cousin Irene --



				 ANNIE

		    -- who's married to --



				 WALTER

		    Harold, who ran away with his 

		    secretary but came back --



				 ANNIE

		    -- because Irene threatened to 

		    put the dog to sleep if he 

		    didn't --



				 WALTER

		    And your brother Tom is a 

		    psychology professor and is 

		    married to...Betsy --



				 ANNIE

		    -- who is the most competitive 

		    woman in the world --



	They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and 

	pull out together.



	EXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT



	Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in 

	front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park 

	their cars.  They get out assembling presents.



				 WALTER

		    Your Uncle Milton lost all his 

		    money in a Puerto Rican 

		    condominium that went belly up, 

		    don't mention the IRS or the 

		    Federal prison system.  Your 

		    mother is Barbara, your father 

		    is Cliff --



				 ANNIE

		    I hope he doesn't get out his 

		    slides.



				 WALTER

		    Am I what they had in mind?



				 ANNIE

		    They're going to love you.



	As they start toward the house.



							CUT TO:



	CLANGING ON THE WINE GLASSES.



	AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



	INT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT



				 BARBARA

		    Everybody! Annie has an announcement --



				 ANNIE

		    Walter and I are engaged!



	And the family's at the diner table.  Annie's family is 

	a completely normally-looking WASP family -- only 

	everyone is a little eccentric.  Annie's mother BARBARA, 

	a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman, 

	claps her hands together.  Her father CLIFF, who's at 

	the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.  

	Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table, 

	along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD.  UNCLE 

	MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.  

	There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.



				 IRENE

		    That's wonderful, Annie.  I 

		    hope it lasts... for years 

		    and years.



				 BETSY

			   (the competitive one)

		    Do you have a ring?



				 ANNIE

		    No.  Not yet.



				 BETSY

		    Oh.  Well.  How will anyone 

		    know?



				 TOM

		    Because you're going to call 

		    them all and tell them.  

		    Congratulations, Walter.



	He claps Walter on the back.



	Walter sneezes.  And sneezes again.



				 CLIFF

		    Are you all right?



				 WALTER

		    It's nothing.  Nothing.



				 ANNIE

		    It's probably just the flowers --



				 BARBARA

		    We'll move them --



				 WALTER

		    Don't touch them.  I feel 

		    terrible sneezing at a time 

		    like this.  This is a big 

		    moment for me --



				 ANNIE

			   (overlapping)

		    He's allergic to everything, 

		    don't worry about it --



				 HAROLD

		    Bees.  I'm allergic to bees.



				 CLIFF

		    Not salmon I hope --



				 ANNIE

		    If he eats one tiny piece of a 

		    nut --



				 WALTER

			   (cheerfully)

		    My head swells up like a 

		    watermelon and I drop dead.



				 IRENE

		    It's the same with Harold and 

		    bees.



				 CLIFF

		    Your mother and I had salmon at 

		    our wedding, and I really think 

		    a wedding without cold salmon --



				 WALTER

		    I'm not allergic to salmon.  I 

		    don't think.  But you never 

		    know.



				 HAROLD

		    You never know.



				 BARBARA

		    Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we 

		    used up this magnum of 

		    champagne we were saving on 

		    something else, what did we use 

		    it for?



				 TOM

		    Uncle Milton's parole --



				 BARBARA

		    Right.



				 UNCLE MILTON

		    And it was delicious.



				 BARBARA

		    It was, wasn't it, Milton 

		    darling --



				 BETSY

		    When are you getting married, 

		    Annie?



				 CLIFF

		    In early June.  In the garden.



				 HAROLD

		    Does it have to be in the garden?



				 IRENE

		    What about Harold and bees?



				 BARBARA

		    We'll spray you.



				 CLIFF

		    Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumber 

		    salad.  Strawberries.



				 WALTER

		    I'm afraid I'm allergic to 

		    strawberries.



				 CLIFF

		    No strawberries.



	Annie smiles at Walter.



				 ANNIE

			   (to Walter)

		    Is that all right with you?



				 WALTER

			   (to Lou Gehrig line)

		    Today I consider myself the 

		    luckiest man on the face of 

		    the earth.



				 IRENE

		    What are you wearing?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know.



				 BETSY

		    I wish you would wear my dress.  

		    I only wore it once, and you'll 

		    barely have to do anything to 

		    it except take it in in the 

		    bust --



				 BARBARA

		    I have something that might do 

		    --



	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER



	Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides 

	of cloud formations in Guatemala.  In the next room 

	Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas 

	carols.



	INT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS



	MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to 

	burp.



	INT. ATTIC - NIGHT



	The sound of Christmas carols from below.



	The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with 

	her mother.  They come to a dressmakers dummy with a 

	sheet over it.  Barbara removes the sheet.  A beautiful 

	antique dress.  A veil sitting on top of the dummy.



				 BARBARA

		    The Historical Society wanted 

		    this and I never would give it 

		    to them --



				 ANNIE

		    Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.



				 BARBARA

		    I notice these things are back 

		    in fashion.  Oh, honey.

			   (tears are rolling down 

			    her face as she tries 

			    the veil on Annie)

		    He's a lovely man, Annie.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.  He's wonderful, isn't 

		    he?



				 BARBARA

		    Are his folks nice?



				 ANNIE

		    You'll love them.  We're going 

		    down to D.C.  tonight to be with 

		    them Christmas morning.



				 BARBARA

		    How did it happen?



	Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back 

	of the dress and remove it from the dummy.



				 ANNIE

		    It's silly, really.  I mean, 

		    I'd seen him at the office, 

		    obviously I'd seen him, he's 

		    the associate publisher, and 

		    then one day we both ordered 

		    sandwiches from the same place, 

		    and he got my lettuce and 

		    tomato sandwich on whole wheat, 

		    which of course he was allergic 

		    to, and I got his lettuce and 

		    tomato on white.



				 BARBARA

			   (utterly without irony)

		    How amazing.



				 ANNIE

		    It is, isn't it? You make 

		    millions of decisions that mean 

		    nothing and then one day you 

		    decide to order takeout and it 

		    changes your life.



				 BARBARA

		    Destiny takes a hand.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, please.  Destiny's just 

		    something we've invented 

		    because we can't stand the fact 

		    that everything that happens is 

		    accidental.



				 BARBARA

		    Then how do you explain that 

		    you both ordered exactly the 

		    same sandwich except for the 

		    bread? How many people in this 

		    world like lettuce and tomato 

		    without something else like 

		    tuna?



				 ANNIE

		    It wasn't a sign.  It was a 

		    coincidence.



	Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie 

	steps into it.



	Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie.



				 BARBARA

		    I was in Atlantic City with my 

		    family.  Cliff was a waiter.  

		    He talked me into sneaking out 

		    for a midnight walk on the 

		    Steel Pier.  I've probably told 

		    you this a million times, but 

		    I don't care.  And then he held 

		    my hand.  I was scared.  All 

		    sorts of thing were going 

		    through my head.  But after a 

		    while I forgot about them.  At 

		    one point I looked down, at our 

		    hands, and I couldn't tell 

		    which fingers were mine and 

		    which were his.  And I knew.



				 ANNIE

			   (hearing it for the 

			    first time)

		    What?



				 BARBARA

		    You know.



				 ANNIE

			   (she doesn't know, but 

			    she doesn't want her 

			    mother to know she 

			    doesn't know)

		    What?



				 BARBARA

		    Magic.  It was magic.



				 ANNIE

			   (repeating)

		    Magic.



				 BARBARA

		    I knew we would be together 

		    forever, and that everything 

		    would be wonderful, just the 

		    way you feel about Walter.  

		    Walter.  It's quite a formal 

		    name, isn't it?

			   (lowering her voice)

		    One of the things I truly knew 

		    was that your father and I were 

		    going to have a wonderful time

		    ... in the sack I believe you 

		    call it --



				 ANNIE

		    Mom!



				 BARBARA

		    Of course it took several years 

		    before everything worked like 

		    clockwork in that department, 

		    so don't be worried if it takes 

		    a while --



				 ANNIE

		    Mom, we already...



				 BARBARA

		    Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da 

		    dee.  And how's it working?



				 ANNIE

		    Like... clockwork.



	She turns to look in the mirror.  The dress doesn't fit 

	at all.  It's completely lopsided.  One shoulder is 

	higher than the other.  The waist is in the wrong spot.  

	The effect is quite comical.



				 BARBARA

		    So you'll get married in a new 

		    dress.



				 ANNIE

		    It's a sign.



				 BARBARA

			   (gently)

		    You don't believe in signs.



	EXT. STREET - LATE



	The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on 

	the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.



				 ANNIE

		    They loved you.  I told you 

		    they would love you and they 

		    did.



				 WALTER

		    I love you.



				 ANNIE

		    I love you, Walter.

			   (beat)

		    Did anyone ever call you 

		    anything other than Walter?



				 WALTER

		    Nope.



				 ANNIE

		    Even when you were young?



				 WALTER

		    Nope.  Not even when I was 

		    young.



	It's starting to rain.



				 WALTER

		    You sure you don't want to 

		    drive with me?



				 ANNIE

		    How will I get back to 

		    Baltimore Saturday?

			   (remembering something)

		    Oh God, I forgot my present for 

		    your stepmother -- I took it 

		    inside by accident.



				 WALTER

		    I'll wait.



				 ANNIE

		    Don't be silly.  I'll just be 

		    ten minutes behind you.



	EXT. BELTWAY - NIGHT



	As Annie drives back toward Washington, D.C.



	Raining.



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



	Annie driving.  Presents on the front seat.  She's 

	singing "Sleigh Ride" and doing all the sound effects 

	and clipclops and giddyups.  After a moment, she 

	realizes she doesn't know all the words and turns on the 

	radio.



				 DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE

		    Welcome back to "You and Your 

		    Emotions." I'm Dr.  Marcia 

		    Fieldstone broadcasting across 

		    America from the top of the 

		    Sears Tower in Chicago where we 

		    would have a fantastic view of 

		    Santa Claus and his reindeer if 

		    there was a -- oops, never 

		    mind.  Tonight we're talking 

		    about wishes and dreams.  

		    What's your wishes this Christmas 

		    Eve? Maybe the best present 

		    you can give yourself is a call 

		    to me.  The number is --



				 ANNIE

		    Give me a break.



	Annie changes the station.



				 RADIO VOICE

		    The subject of the evening's 

		    medical update is You and Your 

		    Spleen and our host --



	She flips the dial back the other way.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Our caller is from Seattle.



	Annie changes the station.



				 RADIO VOICE

		    Coming up, Jingle Bells 

		    backwards, sung by the New 

		    Jersey Cape Mayettes --



	Annie twists the dial back the other way.  We hear a 

	YOUNG BOY's voice.



				 BOY'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    Hello, this is Jonah --

			   (there's a bleep as 

			    Jonah says his last 

			    name)



	Annie's hand lingers on the dial.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    No last names, Jonah.  Hello 

		    there, you sound younger than 

		    our usual callers.  How come 

		    you're up so late?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's not that late in Seattle.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Got me there.  What's your 

		    Christmas wish, Jonah?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's not for me.  It's for my 

		    dad.  I think he needs a new 

		    wife.



	Annie shakes her head.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    You don't like the one he was 

		    now?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    He doesn't have one now.  

		    That's the problem.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Where's your mom?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    She died.



	Annie closes her eyes for a moment.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't believe this --



	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT



	As the car drives along.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I've been pretty sad, but I 

		    think my dad is worse.



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    And you're worried about him.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I'm worried about him, he's 

		    worried about me, I ride my 

		    bike to school, he follows in 

		    the car, like I'm not supposed 

		    to know he's there.  Now it's 

		    Christmas, and you know what 

		    happens to people at Christmas.



				 ANNIE

		    They lose their minds and call 

		    crackpot doctors on the radio --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Have you talked to your dad 

		    about this?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    No.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's very hard for him to talk 

		    about this stuff.  It's like it 

		    makes him sadder.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    You want me to talk to him?



				 ANNIE

		    Perfect.  Sandbag the father.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    And you crazy? He thinks shows 

		    like this are dumb.  If you 

		    didn't have an 800 number I 

		    could never get away with this 

		    --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Is he home right now?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Yeah.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Well, I think I can help a 

		    little more if I talk to him 

		    directly.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I don't know --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm sure he won't be angry once 

		    he realizes how concerned you 

		    are about him.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Okay, but if I get yelled at, 

		    I'm never gonna listen to this 

		    show again.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Fair enough.



	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the 

	houseboat he lives in with Sam.  He's got the phone cord 

	coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's 

	standing near the kitchen end of a large living area 

	looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting 

	in a deck chair looking out at the sea.



				 JONAH

		    Dad --



				 SAM

		    What is it?



	ON ANNIE AGAIN.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    There's somebody on the phone 

		    for you.

			   (into phone)

		    His name is Sam.



				 ANNIE

		    This is completely disgusting.



	INT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam pokes his head in the back door.  He looks much as 

	he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is 

	a little longer.  He picks up the phone extension.



				 SAM

		    Hello.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone on Network America.



	Sam looks across the room to Jonah.



				 SAM

		    I'm probably not interested in 

		    whatever you're selling.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm not selling anything.  Your 

		    son called and asked for advice 

		    on how to find you a new wife.



				 SAM

			   (he really didn't get 

			    her name)

		    Who is this?



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

			   (repeating herself)

		    Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of 

		    Network America.



				 SAM

		    Jesus, are we on the air? 

		    Jonah, for God's sake --



				 JONAH

		    Don't be mad at me, Dad.



	Sam can see Jonah.  He's frightened.  Sam immediately 

	feels how upset Jonah is.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    He feels that since your wife's 

		    death you've been very unhappy. 

		    He's genuinely worried about you.



	Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's 

	standing on.



				 SAM

			   (to Jonah)

		    I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm 

		    not mad at you.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I think it's hard for him to 

		    talk to you about all this.  

		    Maybe we could talk and it 

		    would make him feel a little 

		    better.



	Sam hesitates.



				 JONAH

		    Please --



	INT. ANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT



				 ANNIE

		    This is a grotesque violation 

		    of this man's personal life, 

		    but never mind --



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    All righ...



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Good.  How long ago did your 

		    wife die?



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



				 SAM

		    It's been about a year and a 

		    half.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Have you had any relationship 

		    since?



				 SAM

		    No.



	Sam is very uncomfortable about this --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM

		    Look, Doctor, I don't want to 

		    be rude, but --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    And I don't want to invade your 

		    privacy --



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



				 ANNIE

		    Sure you do.



				 SAM (V.O.)

			   (overlapping)

		    Sure you do --



	Annie smiles.



				 SAM

		    Look, we had a tough time at 

		    first, but I think I'm holding 

		    my own as a dad, and Jonah and 

		    I will get along fine again as 

		    soon as I break his radio.



	Annie laughs.  So does Mr.  Fieldstone



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is smiling too.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I have no doubt that you're a 

		    good dad.  You can tell a lot 

		    from a person's voice.  But 

		    something must be missing if 

		    Jonah feels that you're still 

		    under a cloud.



				 JONAH

		    Tell her how you don't sleep at 

		    night.



				 SAM

		    How do you know that?



	Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally 

	talking to each other on the phone within their own 

	house, but also ON THE AIR.



				 JONAH

		    I can hear you walking around 

		    sometimes.  At first I thought 

		    it was a robber.  Go ahead, 

		    tell her, Dad.



				 SAM

		    I don't think I have to now.



	Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts 

	toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers.  

	On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench.



				 SAM

		    Look, it's almost Christmas --

			   (as the two of them sit 

			    down together on the 

			    bench)

		    A kid needs a mother --



	He puts an arm around Jonah.



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



	As Annie listens.  She's softened considerably.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Could it be that you need 

		    someone just as much as Jonah 

		    does?



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.



	Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm losing my mind.



	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT



	As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    We've been talking to -- well, 

		    let's just call him Sleepless 

		    in Seattle, and we'll be right 

		    back after this break with 

		    listener response, your 

		    response, to the things we've 

		    been discussing.  The number to 

		    call is...



	INT. BALDWIN HOUSE



				 SAM

		    What's she talking about?



				 JONAH

		    This is where other people get 

		    to call in and dump on what you 

		    said.



	We hear the beginning of a commercial.



	INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT



	Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio 

	reverie.  She goes to the counter to order some coffee.  

	There's a commercial on the radio.  The counter WAITRESS 

	LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a 

	TRUCK DRIVER at a booth.  HARRIET, a short-order-cook, 

	is visible through an open window to the kitchen.



				 LORETTA

		    I'll bet he's tall, with a cute 

		    butt.



				 HARRIET

		    I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a 

		    week.  I'll bet he stinks.



				 LORETTA

		    Shut up, Harriet.

			   (to Annie)

		    What'll it be?



				 ANNIE

		    Coffee, please.  Black.  To go.



				 LORETTA

		    Maybe I should hustle myself 

		    out to Seattle.  Give him a 

		    little present for New Year's 

		    Eve.



				 HARRIET

		    You can go there if you want 

		    but don't open his refrigerator.  

		    They don't cover anything when 

		    they put it in the fridge.  

		    They just stick it in and leave 

		    it there till it walks out by 

		    itself.



				 LORETTA

		    Harriet, ever since you 

		    divorced your last husband, 

		    you've been no fun.  I'm 

		    looking, and this guy pops my 

		    tarts.



				 TRUCK DRIVER

		    Come on, Loretta, you're going 

		    to have to jump-start this guy.  

		    His battery's dead.  And look 

		    at me.  Mister Ever-Ready.  

		    Every six minutes, another 

		    charge.



				 LORETTA

		    I'm looking for someone 

		    sensitive.



				 ANNIE

		    Come on, nobody wants a guy 

		    who's sensitive on the radio.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Let's take a call before we get 

		    back to Sleepless.  Knoxville, 

		    Tennessee, you're on.



				 SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE

		    Yes, I would just like to know 

		    where I could get this man's 

		    address?



				 LORETTA

			   (to the radio)

		    Honey, get on line.



	EXT. DINER - NIGHT



	As Annie gets into her car.



	EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C.  STREET - NIGHT



	Annie driving toward the house where Walter's parents 

	live.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Do you think there's somebody 

		    out there you could love as 

		    much as your wife? Maybe even 

		    more?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    It's hard to imagine.



	And cut back and forth between the car and the 

	houseboat.  Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but 

	Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap.  Sam is stroking 

	the boy's hair.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What are you going to do, Sam?



				 SAM

		    I don't know.  When I met my 

		    wife, it was so clear.  I just 

		    knew.



	Annie is listening now.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What was it that made you know?



				    SAM

		    I don't think I could really 

		    describe it.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM

		    And if I could describe it, 

		    it probably wouldn't be on a radio 

		    show.

			   (he laughs to himself)

		    But what the hell.  It's not 

		    one specific thing.  It's more 

		    of a feeling.

			   (continued)



	Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in 

	Washington, D.C., the motor running.  She's hooked now, 

	she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it 

	all.



				 SAM

		    You touch her for the first 

		    time, and suddenly... you're 

		    home.  It's almost like...



				 ANNIE

		    Magic.



				 SAM

		    Magic.



	CLOSER ON ANNIE



	realizing she has just said this.  Realizing that it 

	must mean something but not knowing what.



	SHE'S CRYING.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Well, it's time to wrap up, 

		    folks --



	A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which 

	Annie doesn't notice.  She's wiping the tears away with 

	her hand.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    We hope you'll call again soon.



	The figure TAPS on the window --



				 WALTER

			   (muffled, outside car)

		    Annie?



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

	    	    ... and let us know how it's 

	    	    going.



	-- and taps again.



				 WALTER

		    Annie?



	She turns.  He's pointing at the locked door.  She 

	searches for the button.  Finally finds it so that 

	Walter can open the door.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm sorry, Walter.  I just 

		    heard the most amazing thing on 

		    the radio.



	They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie 

	carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.



				 ANNIE

		    People call up these shows and 

		    you can't believe the stuff 

		    they say.  It's the end of 

		    privacy as we know it, this 

		    country is just one big global 

		    village with everyone out there 

		    going blah blah blah --



	As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see 

	a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.



							CUT TO:



	A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS



	as we pull back to reveal:



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY MORNING



	As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut 

	from gift to gift:



	A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and 

	which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing 

	to open:



	A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his 

	neck.



	A PLAID SHIRT



	A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind that's used in 

	schoolrooms that pulls down from a roller.



	And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind 

	the door and Jonah opens --



	A NEW FISHING ROD



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY



	As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his 

	tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new 

	plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam 

	takes his picture.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY (OR POSSIBLY EXT. DECK HOUSEBOAT)



	Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he 

	made in woodworking class.



				 SAM

		    The hopes are perfect -- 

		    beautiful, identical, smooth -- 

		    and they are for something 

		    really amazing I feel it in my 

		    bones --



				 JONAH

		    It's a spice rack.



				 SAM

		    We desperately need a spice 

		    rack.  Desperately.



							CUT TO:



	INT. KITCHEN OF HOUSEBOAT - DAY



				 SAM

		    And we desperately need spices.



	Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper, 

	salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which 

	has room for at least twenty more.  Jonah is 

	methodically making pancakes.



				 JONAH

		    Dad?  About last night?



				 SAM

		    It's never happening again.  

		    Right?



				 JONAH

		    Right.



	There's a knock on the door.



				 SAM

		    Then it never happened.



	Sam goes to answer the door.



	TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there.  Both are wearing 

	quite a lot of Spandex.  One of them is named LULU.  It 

	says so on her jacket.  The other is JOBETH.



				 SAM

		    Hi.



				 LULU

		    Hi.  Sam?



				 SAM

		    Yes?



				 LULU

			   (looking in and seeing 

			       Jonah)

		    You must be Jonah.



	Jonah nods.



				 LULU

			   (to her friend)

		    See.  I told you.  Sam and 

		    Jonah.  I'm LULU.  This is 

		    JoBeth.



	JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks.



				 LULU

			   (continues)

		    We live two piers over, don't 

		    we? Number 12, right? We're 

		    having like a really neat open 

		    house today from like four to 

		    whenever if you care to stop 

		    by.



				 SAM

		    Thanks, but... we've got plans.



				 LULU

		    Well, here's the number.  If 

		    you ever find yourself 

		    Sleepless, give us a call.  We 

		    also... do babysitting.



	She winks.  JoBeth nods.



	Sam nods.



	Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down 

	the dock.



	Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam.



				 JONAH

		    Not.



				 SAM

		    My feelings exactly.



	EXT. LAKE UNION MARINA - EARLY MORNING



	Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.



				 SAM

		    How many people do you think 

		    heard that thing last night?



				 JONAH

		    It plays in 50 states.



				 SAM

		    What?!



				 JONAH

		    Nobody else is going to know it 

		    was us.



				 SAM

		    You're right.

			   (after a beat)

		    You better hope so.



	EXT. BALTIMORE SUN - MORNING



	INT. LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY



	A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at 

	computers.  Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned 

	offices and meeting rooms.  Inside one of the offices is 

	BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.  She's at a 

	table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and 

	two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT.  Wyatt is 

	playing Gameboy.



				 KEITH

		    This man sells the greatest 

		    soup you've ever eaten, there's 

		    a line around the block, and he 

		    is, I am not kidding, the meanest 

		    man in America.

			   (beat)

		    I feel strongly about this, 

		    Becky.  This is not just about 

		    soup.



				 BECKY

		    Do it.  What else?



				 WYATT

		    New Year's Eve.  Please don't 

		    make me write it.



	Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy.



				 BECKY

		    Wyatt, I do not mean to remind 

		    you of your mother, but if you 

		    don't put that game away, no TV 

		    for a week.



				 WYATT

			   (pushing it to the 

			    center of the table)

		    Would someone look this up, 

		    don't tell me where.



	Becky is riffling through some papers on the table, 

	among which are some tearsheets from the Associated 

	Press wire.



				 BECKY

		    Listen to this.  Phone service 

		    in the greater Chicago area was 

		    tied up for two hours Christmas 

		    Eve because some kid called a 

		    phone-in show to get a wife for 

		    his father.  Two thousand women 

		    called in for the number.



				 KEITH

		    Jesus.



				 ANNIE

		    I heard it.  This kid calls up 

		    and says my dad needs a wife 

		    and I'm talking to myself in 

		    the car saying, this is 

		    completely disgusting, you're 

		    taking advantage of a child, 

		    and then the father gets on and 

		    this shrinkette says, do you 

		    want to talk about it? And he 

		    says no as a matter of fact I 

		    don't, and I am saying, bravo! 

		    Right on! Don't talk to her, 

		    it's none of her business --

			   (she's completely into 

			    this story now)

		    -- and then suddenly, for no 

		    reason at all, he's talking 

		    about how much he loved his 

		    wife, and how he just --

			   (she snaps her fingers)

		    fell in love with her and I am 

		    crying.  Me.  A tear is 

		    actually rolling down my face.  

		    It was like what happens when I 

		    watch those phone company ads.  

		    I don't have to see the whole 

		    ad, I just have to see the part 

		    where the daughter gives her 

		    mother a refrigerator with a 

		    big red bow on it, have you 

		    seen that one?



	Everyone looks at her.  Apparently she's finished.



				 BECKY

		    You should write something 

		    about this.



				 ANNIE

		    About what?



				 BECKY

		    Whatever it is.



				 KEITH

			   (waving the AP story)

		    What it is is, there are a lot 

		    of desperate women out there 

		    looking for love.



				 WYATT

		    Especially over a certain age.



	Annie is looking at them.  This isn't what she was 

	talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what 

	she was talking about.



				 KEITH

		    It is easier to be killed by a 

		    terrorist after the age of 40 

		    than it is to get married --



				 ANNIE

		    That is not true.  That 

		    statistic is not true.



				 BECKY

		    It's not true, but it feels 

		    true.



				 ANNIE

		    There's practically a whole 

		    book about how that statistic 

		    is not true --



				 WYATT

		    Calm down.  You brought it up --



				 ANNIE

			   (sharply)

		    I did not, Wyatt.



	A beat, everyone pauses.  Things are a little out of 

	hand.



				 BECKY

		    So where were we?



				 WYATT

		    New Year's Eve.  I'll do it, 

		    okay?



				 BECKY

		    Okay.



				 ANNIE

		    If someone is a widower, why do 

		    they say he was widowed? Why 

		    don't they say he was widowered?



	Everyone looks at her strangely.



				 ANNIE

		    I was jus wondering.



	EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DAY



	Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying 

	to catch up.



				 BECKY

		    What was that about up there?



				 ANNIE

		    What was what?



				 BECKY

		    What's with you?



				 ANNIE

		    Nothing's with me.



	INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - DAY



	Becky and Annie are having lunch.



				 BECKY

		    "Sleepless in Seattle"?



				 ANNIE

		    That's what she called him on 

		    the show.  Because he can't 

		    sleep.



				 BECKY

		    And now 2,000 women want his 

		    number.  The guy could be a 

		    crackhead, a psychopath, a 

		    flasher, a junkie, a 

		    transvestite, a chain-saw 

		    murderer, or someone really 

		    sick, like Rick.



				 ANNIE

		    Actually, he sounded nice.



				 BECKY

		    Oh? Oh, really? Now we're 

		    getting down to it.



				 ANNIE

		    Not.



	She reaches down for her purse.



	INT/EXT. REMODEL HOUSE - DAY



	A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle 

	newspaper, and



	PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



	Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old 

	house that's being renovated.  Jonah, who is playing 

	Cameboy, is walking along with him.  WORKMEN are active 

	everywhere.  Dry wall going up, cabinets being 

	installed, tile being set.



	One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him, 

	and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for 

	them in an unfinished doorframe.  Bob is hefty, older, 

	always eating something dietetic.  Jay is younger and 

	always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.



				 BOB LANGMAN

		    Now she wants a circular 

		    stairwell off the den.



				 JAY

			   (to Jonah, in b.g.)

		    Punch me, punch in right here.

			   (points to his stomach;

			    Jonah punches)

		    And she wants the Sub-Zero with 

		    the side-by-side doors --



				 BOB

		    Which means --



				 SAM

		    The cabinets have to be redone 

		    --



	They all nod at each other.  The woman has been a 

	nightmare.



				 BOB

		    So we thought --



				 JAY

		    Since you're on the make again 

		    --



	Sam looks at Jonah --



				 SAM

		    Great.  This is great.  The 

		    whole town knows.  Just out of 

		    curiosity, how do you two know?



				 BOB

		    Grace heard it.



				 SAM

		    Grace the dispatcher.  Great.



				 BOB

		    The point is, take the client 

		    out to dinner and ask her to 

		    marry you and then maybe we 

		    won't have to redo the kitchen 

		    cabinets.



				 SAM

		    Why me? What about Jay?



				 JAY

		    Hey, my plate is full.



				 SAM

		    Well, okay.  What's the big 

		    deal?  If she'll forget the 

		    new fireplace, I'll marry her.  

		    Just point me in the right 

		    direction.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, I don't know about this 

		    one --



				 SAM

		    Oh, you're changing your mind 

		    --



				 JONAH

		    No, I'm not, but --



				 SAM

		    What's the matter with this 

		    one? Wouldn't you like to have 

		    Imelda Marcos as your mother?



				 JONAH

		    Dad --



	Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.



				 SAM

		    We better take the measurements 

		    for the new cabinets.



	He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.  and 

	starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in 

	another area of the site.  Bob follows after him.  Jay 

	tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into 

	the wall.



				 BOB

		    Sam, if you're not doing 

		    anything New Year's -- 

		    obviously you're not doing 

		    anything New Year's -- we're 

		    having some people over, all of 

		    them married, not one even 

		    remotely interested in playing 

		    around.  Does that sound great 

		    or what?

			   (whistfully)

		    I can't think of the last time 

		    I was at a party when anything 

		    actually happened.



				 SAM

		    Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's 

		    kind of a big night.  I don't 

		    like to leave Jonah alone.

	SHOT OF  HOUSEBOAT BEING TOWED BY A TUG DOWN THE RIVER (OR A 

	SEAPLANE LANDING) - TWILIGHT



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - TWILIGHT



	Jonah watching it.  Sam visible in the distance in the 

	kitchen.



	INT. KITCHEN - TWILIGHT



	As Sam is busy installing the spice rack.  He marks the 

	wall, hammers in the nails, etc.



				 SAM

			   (as he starts putting 

			    new spices into the 

			    rack, in alphabetical 

			    order)

		    Does red pepper go under R or 

		    P?



				 JONAH

		    P.

			   (beat)

		    Dad?



				 SAM

			   (absently)

		    What?



				 JONAH

		    I forgot to mention.  Jed 

		    called --



				 SAM

		    Just out of curiosity, do you 

		    have any friends whose names 

		    don't begin with a J?  I feel 

		    like it was a failure of the 

		    imagination on our part naming 

		    you Jonah.

		  	   (looking at the spices)

		    What is marjoram? Does anyone 

		    know?



				 JONAH

		    Jed is having a slumber party 

		    New Year's Eve and he invited 

		    me.



	A beat.



				 SAM

		    Fine.  Fine.



				 JONAH

		    So I can go.



				 SAM

		    Sure.

			   (almost done with the 

			    spices)

		    Looking good.



				 JONAH

		    Shouldn't you have used a 

		    toggle bolt?



				 SAM

		    I think I know how to have a 

		    spice rack.



	He puts in the last spice.



	They stand back to admire it.  A beat.  The rack falls 

	off the wall.



	The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the 

	glass jars of spices break.



	There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc.  all 

	over the floor along with shards of glass.



				 SAM

	    	    God fucking dammit!  Shit! 

	    	    Fuck.  Piss.



	Jonah bursts into tears.



				 SAM

			   (still angry)

		    I'm sorry.

			   (softening)

		    I'm sorry.



	He picks up Jonah and holds him.



				 SAM

		    I'm sorry.  I'm just --



				 JONAH

		    Stressed.



				 SAM

		    Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm 

		    sorry.



	And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down.  Sam closes his 

	eyes tight.



	INT. A TELEVISION SET OF NEW YEAR'S EVE ON TIMES SQUARE



	And pull back to reveal:



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam, alone, watching the ball drop.  He's got a bag of 

	Doritos and a beer.



				 A VOICE

		    Can I have half your beer?



				 SAM

		    Sure.



	It's Maggie.



	She takes his bottle of beer and pours half of it into a 

	glass.



				 MAGGIE

		    What did I used to say? Here's 

		    looking at you? Here's mud in 

		    your eye?



				 SAM

		    Here's to us.  You used to say 

		    here's to us.

			   (he looks at her and 

			    his eyes well with 

			    tears)

		    Oh babe.  I miss you so much it 

		    hurts.



	He reaches out for her.  She's gone.



	And we hear the television set now counting down to 

	midnight in New York.



							CUT TO:



	INT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY IN BALTIMORE - NIGHT



	The same television show counting down to midnight.



	Champagne corks popping, etc.



	And we see Walter and Annie.



				 WALTER

		    Happy New Year, darling.



				 ANNIE

		    Happy New Year.



	They start to dance.



				 WALTER

		    I was thinking, I have to go up 

		    to Boston for the AAP 

		    convention and then visit 

		    Winston-Hughes about switching 

		    over our computers.  Why don't 

		    we meet in New York for 

		    Valentine's Day weekend?



				 ANNIE

		    Walter, I'd love to --



				 WALTER

		    We'll stay at the Plaza --



				 ANNIE

		    Go for a walk in Central Park --



				 WALTER

		    Go to the Symphony --



	A beat.



				 ANNIE

		    We will?

			   (beat)

		    The Symphony?

			   (beat)

		    Okay.

			   (beat)

		    I'll take you to the Russian 

		    Tea Room for pelmeni.


				 WALTER

		    What is it?



				 ANNIE

		    It's delicious, trust me.



				 WALTER

		    Does it have wheat in it?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't think so.



	They go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where 

	everyone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however, 

	looks thoughtful.



	ET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY



	Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward 

	his houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries.



	In the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY



	Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over 

	his face.



	A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the 

	front door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt 

	for the mail.



				 JONAH

		    Look at this, Dad.  They're 

		    all for you --



	Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's 

	addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia 

	Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's 

	stunned.  As he signs the receipt:



				 MAILMAN

		    If you're having trouble 

		    sleeping, you might want to try 

		    drinking a glass of water from 

		    the other side.



				 JONAH

		    I thought that was for hiccups.



				 MAILMAN

		    Does it work for hiccups?



				 JONAH

		    For hiccups, a spoonful of 

		    sugar, you hold it in your 

		    mouth for a minute.



				 MAILMAN

		    Really?



	The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the door.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting 

	at the table, reading the letters from the stack they 

	found by the door.



				 SAM

		    Just out of curiosity, how did 

		    they get our address?



				 JONAH

		    They called and asked for it.

			   (reading)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle.  

		    You are the most attractive man 

		    I've ever laid ears on."



	Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of 

	rejects, opens another.



				 SAM

		    How did they get our phone 

		    number?



				 JONAH

		    You have to give them your 

		    phone number or they won't let 

		    you go on the air.



	Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.



				 JONAH

			   (continues, reading)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

		    am an SWF"--

			   (to Sam)

		    What is that?



				 SAM

		    Thank God.  Something you don't 

		    know.  It's a single white 

		    female.



				 JONAH

		    This is no good.  She's looking 

		    for someone French.  Or Greek.

			   (puzzled, he throws the 

			    letter into the reject 

			    pile, opens another)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

		    live in Tulsa." Where is that? 

		    --



				 SAM

		    Oklahoma.  Do you know where 

		    that is?



				 JONAH

		    Somewhere in the middle.



				 SAM

		    I'm not going to think about 

		    what they're not teaching you 

		    in school.  I am not going to 

		    think about it.

			      (beat)

		    Generally speaking I think we 

		    should rule out people who 

		    don't live somewhere near here 

		    --



				 JONAH

		    She's willing to fly anywhere.



	As Jonah hands Sam the picture.



				 SAM

		    She looks like my third grade 

		    teacher.  I hated my third 

		    grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait 

		    a minute! She is my third 

		    grade teacher!



				 JONAH

		    Dad, you're not taking this 

		    seriously.



				 SAM

		    This is not how you do it.

			   (referring to the 

			    hamburger)

		    You want this on an English 

		    muffin or a bun?



				 JONAH

		    English muffin.  How do you do 

		    it?



				 SAM

		    You see someone you like, you 

		    get a feeling about them, you 

		    ask them if they want to have a 

		    drink or --



				 JONAH

		    -- a slice of pizza --



				 SAM

		    But not dinner necessarily on 

		    the first date because by the 

		    time you're halfway through 

		    dinner you might be sorry you 

		    asked them to dinner whereas if 

		    it's just a drink, if you like 

		    them you can always ask them 

		    for dinner but if you don't you 

		    can go home if you see what I 

		    mean.

			      (beat)

		    I wonder if it still works this 

		    way.



				 JONAH

		    It doesn't.  They ask you.



				 SAM

		    I'm starting to notice that.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter are making love.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    If you get a new wife, I guess 

		    you'll have sex with her, huh?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    What do you think?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Will she scratch up your back?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    What?



	JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	As Sam puts Jonah to sleep.  Jonah is holding his teddy 

	bear while this conversation concludes.



				 JONAH

		    In the movies women are always 

		    scratching up guy's back and 

		    screaming and stuff.  When 

		    they're having sex.



				 SAM

		    Whose show was this on?



				 JONAH

		    Jed's got cables.



				 SAM

		    Go to sleep.



	He kisses him good-night.



				 JONAH

		    Kiss Howard.

			   (he holds out the 

			    teddy bear)

		    G'night, Howard.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter have just finished making love.



	Walter falling asleep.



	Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open.



	She starts to get out of bed.  Puts on a robe.



	INT. STAIRWAY - HOUSE



	As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe.



	She opens the door to the street.



	EXT. STREET - NIGHT



	As Annie starts to run down the street.



	CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING



	And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running 

	down.



	Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles.



	Past another sign: Your nerves are shot.



	And another: Your feet are cold.



	And another: Will you find love.



	And another: Before you're cold?



	And another: Burma Shave.



	And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running 

	across a map of the United States -- it's a little like 

	the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's 

	like the famous map of the United States by Saul 

	Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one 

	is about Seattle.



	In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two 

	indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start 

	to wave at her, very slowly.



	Annie's eyes widen.



							CUT TO:



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie in bed, eyes open.  Walter fast asleep.



	She gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did 

	in the dream sequence).



	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT



	As Annie comes down the stairs.



	INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE



	She turns the light on.



	Opens the refrigerator.



	Closes it.



	Opens it again.  Takes out some milk.



	Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes, 

	banana.  She's about to assemble it when:



	She sees:



	THE RADIO



	She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr. Marcia 

	Fieldstone is on.  She sits back down with her corn 

	flakes.



				 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

		    Up next, "You and Your 

		    Emotions" with Dr.  Marcia 

		    Fieldstone, clinical 

		    psychologist and the best 

		    friend you never had.

			   (the teaser continues)



				 WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

		He says he doesn't love me any 

		more.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why do you want to be with 

		    someone who doesn't love you?



				 ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.)

		    Every time I come close to 

		    orgasm he stops and goes to 

		    make himself a sandwich --

	

				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why don't you make him a 

		    sandwich beforehand?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    When I met my wife, it was so 

		    clear.  I jus knew.



	Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What was it that made you know?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    I don't think I could really 

		    describe it.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    And if I could describe it, it 

		    probably wouldn't be on a radio 

		    show.

			   (he laughs to himself)

		    But what the hell.  It's not 

		    one specific thing.  It's more 

		    of a feeling.  

			      (continuing)

		    You touch her for the first 

		    time, and suddenly... you're 

		    home.  It's almost like... 

		    magic.



	Annie closes her eyes.



				 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

		    We'll be back after this 

		    commercial with Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone.



	EXT. BALTIMORE - PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY



	We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the 

	Peabody Library.  Annie gets out of the car.



	INT. LIBRARY - DAY



	As Annie strides purposefully across the library and 

	enters:



	INT. ANNIE'S BROTHER TOM'S OFFICE - DAY



	Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his 

	desk.  We barely has time to look up.



				 ANNIE

		    I think I'm going crazy, Tom.  

		    I really do.  Are you happily 

		    married?



				 TOM

			   (completely panicked by 

			    the question)

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    I mean, why did you get 

		    married? Was it all fireworks 

		    and trumpets and --



				 TOM

			   (regaining composure)

		    I got married because Betsy 

		    said we had to break up or get 

		    married.  So we get married.



				 ANNIE

		    But when you met her, did you 

		    believe she was the only person 

		    for you? That in some mystical, 

		    cosmic way, it was fated?



				 TOM

		    Annie, when you meet someone 

		    and you're attracted to them, 

		    it just means that your 

		    subconscious is attracted to 

		    their subconscious, 

		    subconsciously.  So what we 

		    think of as chemistry is just 

		    two neuroses knowing that they 

		    are a perfect match.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't even know him.  But 

		    I'm having all these fantasies 

		    about a man I've never met, 

		    who lives in Seattle.



				 TOM

		    It rains nine months of the 

		    year in Seattle.



				 ANNIE

		    I know, I know.  I do not want 

		    to move to Seattle.  But what I 

		    really don't want to do is end 

		    up always wondering what might 

		    have happened and knowing I 

		    could have done something.  

		    What do you think?

			   (Tom opens his mouth to 

			    say something, but 

			    before anything comes 

			    out, Annie fills the 

			    void)

		    It's just cold feet, isn't it? 

		    Everyone panics before they get 

		    married, didn't you?



				 TOM

		    Yes, I did.



				 ANNIE

		    Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much 

		    better just having blown this 

		    off.



				 TOM

		    Any time.



	INT. PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY



	As Annie walks through it and pushes the door to exit.



	EXT. A DOOR OPENING TO SEATTLE STREET - DAY



	Sam and Jay walk out of the Arctic Building onto the 

	street.



				 JAY

		    Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda

		    ... She's a weightlifter, but 

		    it's not like her neck is 

		    bigger than her head or 

		    anything --



				 SAM

		    I'm not asking you to set me 

		    up, Jay.  That's not what I 

		    need your help for.  I want to 

		    know what it's like over there.



				 JAY

		    And that's what I'm trying to 

		    tell you.  What women are 

		    looking over, okay? Pecs and a 

		    cute butt.



				 SAM

		    You mean, like, "He has the 

		    cutest butt"? Where did I hear 

		    that recently?



				 JAY

		    Everywhere.  You can't even 

		    turn on the news without 

		    hearing about how some babe 

		    thought some guy's butt was 

		    cute.  Who the first babe to 

		    say this was I don't know, 

		    but it caught on.



	INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - DAY



	Sam and Jay at the counter.  Out the window, we can see 

	water.



				 JAY

		    When's the latest time you were 

		    out there?



				 SAM

			   (trying to remember)

		    Seventy... eight.



				 JAY

		    Well.  Things are different.  

		    First, you have to be friends.  

		    You have to like each other.  

		    Then you neck.  This can go on 

		    for years.  Then you have 

		    tests.  Then you get to do it 

		    with a condom.

			   (beat)

		    The good news is, split the 

		    check.



				 SAM

		    I don't think it could let a 

		    woman pay for dinner.



				 JAY

		    Great.  They'll have a parade 

		    in your honor.  You'll be Man 

		    of the Year in Seattle 

		    Magazine.  Tira misu.



				 SAM

		    What's tira misu?



				 JAY

		    You'll find out.



				 SAM

		    What is it?



				 JAY

		    You'll see.



				 SAM

		    Some woman is going to want me 

		    to do it to her and I'm not 

		    going to know what it is.



				 JAY

		    You'll like it.



				 SAM

			   (grimly)

		    This is going to be tougher 

		    than I thought.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING



	Sam coming home.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING



	As he enters.  It's very quiet.  Too quiet.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	No answers.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	He starts to look concerned.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	He goes down the hall to Jonah's room.  The door is 

	shut.  He opens it.



	Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape.  

	Earphones on.  Next to him is a young girl named 

	JESSICA.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	Jonah takes off the earphones.



				 JONAH

		    Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.



				 SAM

		    It's nice to meet you, Jessica.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, this is amazing.  If you 

		    play this backwards, it says 

		    "Paul is dead."



				 SAM

		    I know.



				 JONAH

		    How do you know?



	Sam shrugs, turns to go back down the hall.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, could you close the door?



				 JESSICA

		    H and G.

			   (Sam looks back)

		    Hi and goodbye.



	Sam closes the door to Jonah's room.



	Hold on Sam.



				 SAM

			   (to himself)

		    Get a life.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS



	As Sam comes downstairs, goes into his office.  Closes 

	the door.



	INT. SAM'S OFFICE AT HOME - CONTINUOUS



	He goes to the phone.  Looks up a number in the phone 

	book.  Picks up the phone and dials a number.



				 SAM

		    Hi, Victoria?... It's Sam 

		    Baldwin, I don't know if you 

		    remember me.  Oh?  Well, great.  

		    I was wondering if you wanted 

		    to have a drink... Friday, 

		    say... Dinner?... Sure, dinner 

		    would be fine.  Sure.  Dinner.



	INT. AN UNFINISHED DINNER ON A PLATE IN ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM 

	- NIGHT



	Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television, 

	tears pouring down her face.  Cary Grant is saying: "Are 

	you in love with him?" Deborah Kerr replies: "I'm not 

	now."



	She's sitting at the dining room table.  A dozen pieces 

	of paper litter the table.  Annie's been unsuccessfully 

	typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter.



				 ANNIE

		    Now those were the days when 

		    people knew how to be in love.



	She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.  

	Becky leans in, refilling the glass.  Annie begins to 

	type and sob and look at the TV.



				 BECKY

		    You're a basket case.



				 ANNIE

			   (as she types)

		    They knew it.  Time, distance, 

		    nothing could separate them.  

		    Because they knew.  It was 

		    right.  It was real.  It was...



				 BECKY

		    ... movie.

			   (beat)

		    That's your problem.  You don't 

		    want to be in love.  You want 

		    to be in love in a movie.

			   (beat)

		    Read it to me.



				 ANNIE

			   (reading her letter)

		    "Dear Sleepless and Son..."



				 BECKY

		    It sounds like the name of a 

		    mattress store --



				 ANNIE

		    "I am not the sort of person 

		    who listens to call-in radio 

		    shows" --



	Becky flops on the couch.



				 BECKY

		    And this woman is a writer! 

		    That's what everyone writes at 

		    the beginning of letters to 

		    strangers.



				 ANNIE

		    I know that.  You think I don't 

		    know that? "I know that's a 

		    dumb way to begin, but it's the 

		    only way I can think of to 

		    convey what happened to me the 

		    other night when I heard the 

		    two of you on the radio.  On 

		    the other hand, maybe I'm just 

		    losing my mind."



				 BECKY

		    You are.  You're losing your 

		    mind.  What about Walter?



				 ANNIE

		    I'm going to marry Walter.  I 

		    just have to get this out of my 

		    system.



				 BECKY

		    Right.



				 ANNIE

		    I should say something in this 

		    about magic.



				 BECKY

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know.  I mean, what if 

		    I never meet him? What if this 

		    man is my destiny and I never 

		    meet him?



				 BECKY

		    Your destiny can be your doom.  

		    Look at me and Rick.



				 ANNIE

			   (typing some more)

		    "I want to meet you..."



	Cary Grant says: "How about the top of the Empire State 

	Building?"



				 BECKY

		    "On top of the Empire State 

		    Building at sunset on 

		    Valentine's Day."



				 ANNIE

		    Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New 

		    York with Walter, I can squeeze 

		    it in.



	She types in Becky's idea.



	Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter, 

	smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and 

	into Becky's lap.



				 BECKY

		    You want to hear about destiny? 

		    If my husband hadn't gone on a 

		    diet, which caused me to leave 

		    him, I would never have been on 

		    that flight to Miami, and met 

		    Rick, and ended up having sex 

		    in the bathroom of a 727 with 

		    that nob you slide that says 

		    "vacant-occupied, vacant-

		    occupied, vacant-occupied" --

			   (she shudders in 

			    ecstasy, then pulls 

			    herself together)



				 ANNIE

		    You never told me you left your 

		    husband because he went on a 

		    diet.



				 BECKY

			   (nods; after a beat)

		    He lost all the weight... 

		    there.



				 ANNIE

		    That's impossible.  A guy can't 

		    --



				 BECKY

		    Can too.



				 ANNIE

		    No.



				 BECKY

		    Yes.



				 ANNIE

		    And then you left him? He lost 

		    weight there and you left him?



				 BECKY

		    Plus he fell in love with a 

		    temp.



				 ANNIE

		    Listen to this, I love this 

		    part --



	Deborah Kerr says: "It's now or never." And Cary Grant 

	says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by." 

	Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no 

	warm memories."



	Becky and Annie with tears rolling down their faces.



				 BECKY

		    Men never get this movie.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.



				 BECKY

		    Do you think at the end of the 

		    movie when she's in the 

		    wheelchair they can still do 

		    it?



				 ANNIE

		    I always wondered about that 

		    too.



	As Becky reaches for a Kleenex.



	INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM



	A Kleenex being pulled from a box.  Sam is giving it to 

	Jonah, who's up.  His hair is mated with perspiration.



				 SAM

		    It's okay, it's okay.  I'm 

		    here.



	A beat while Jonah calms down.



				 JONAH

		    It was sinking.



				 SAM

		    What was?



				 JONAH

		    Our house.  There was water 

		    coming in all the windows.



				 SAM

			   (calm and definite)

		    You're worried we're going to 

		    be all right.  We're going to 

		    be all right.

			   (Sam gives Jonah a 

			    squeeze)

		    I remember sometimes you'd have 

		    nightmares as a baby.  Your mom 

		    would hold you and rock you and 

		    sing you a song.



				 JONAH

		    Bye bye blackbird.



				 SAM

		    Is that what she used to sing?



				 JONAH

		    I miss her.

			   (beat)

		    What do you think happens to 

		    someone after they die?



				 SAM

		    I don't know.



				 JONAH

		    Like do you believe in heaven?



				 SAM

		    I never did.  Or the whole idea 

		    of an afterlife.  But I don't 

		    know any more.  I have these 

		    dreams about... your mom... and 

		    we have long talks about... 

		    about you, and how you are, 

		    which she sort of knows but I 

		    tell her anyway.  So what is 

		    that? It's sort of an afterlife, 

		    isn't it?



				 JONAH

		    I'm starting to forget her.



				 SAM

		    I know.  But she's here, Jonah.  

		    Because I have you.  And as 

		    long as I have you, I have your 

		    Mom.



	Hold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye 

	Blackbird.



				 SAM

		    I... uh... have a date with 

		    someone Friday night.



				 JONAH

		    Good.



	A beat.



				 SAM

		    Did I ever tell you about the 

		    time I ate a dog biscuit?



	As Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK 

	FROM THE BED AND...



							CUT TO:



	EXT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT



	AS MUSIC CONTINUES.  Annie waves as Becky gets into her 

	car and rides away.  Annie turns to her doorway and 

	stops.  She can't go back in.  She needs to walk and 

	think.  She crosses the street into a little 

	neighborhood park.  We can see the moon.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam comes out onto the porch.  Flops down in his deck 

	chair.  The city lights in the background.  Same moon.  

	The MUSIC CONTINUES.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. PARK - NIGHT



	Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park.  

	MUSIC CONTINUES.



							CUT TO:



	CLOSE ON SAM



	CLOSE ON ANNIE



	AND A LONG SHOT OF ANNIE IN THE SWING



	As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled 

	out of.  Annie starts toward him.



	A LONG SHOT OF SAM ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT



	Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late 

	tonight, blackbird, bye bye.



	FADE IN:



	INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY



	Annie on the phone at her desk.



				 ANNIE

		    Laurie, it's Annie.  Fine, I'm 

		    fine.  Listen, I'm doing an 

		    article on call-in radio shows.  

		    Do you know anyone who works 

		    for someone named Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone...?



							CUT TO:



	Annie on the phone.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm a writer for the Baltimore 

		    Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie 

		    Johnson's.  I'm doing a piece 

		    on how people handle 

		    bereavement and I understand 

		    that you had a caller the other 

		    night... I know you're not 

		    supposed to, but Laurie said 

		    you might, and I'll plug the 

		    show and everything --

			   (she winces in

	that Annie's reading.  There's a newspaper picture of 

	Sam at the dedication of a building site.  It's got that 

	kind of grainy quality that things have when they've 

	been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good 

	looks.

	Detective Bo Wheedle, a former cop, sits at his desk

		    I need to know about him

		    Do you want a matrimonial, past

		    No, no, no, it's more like, who

		    A sense of humor.

		    I'll tell you the truth, I 

		    heard this guy on a call-in 

		    radio show and I might not 

		    marry the person I should marry

	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is watching Geraldo with his babysitter, CLARISE,

	WOMAN.

		    So how long have you been a 

		    woman?



				 WOMAN

			   (husky voice)

		    About two weeks.



	Sam is coming down the stairs.



				 CLARISE

			   (to Jonah)

		    Pssst!



	Jonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to 

	the Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed 

	for his date.



				 SAM

		    Clarise, I'll be back by 

		    midnight I'm sure --



				 CLARISE

		    Whenever.



	Sam tosses Jonah a letter.



				 SAM

		    This one's for both of us.



				 JONAH

			   (reading from the 

			    envelope)

		    Sleepless and Son.

			   (reading the postmark)

		    Baltimore.



	He starts to open the letter.



				 SAM

		    I left the number of the 

		    restaurant I'll be at if 

		    there's any emergency.



				 CLARISE

		    Fine.



				 SAM

			   (to Jonah)

		    How do I look?



				 JONAH

			   (absently)

		    Great.



				 SAM

			   (looks in mirror)

		    I look stupid.  I look stupid, 

		    don't I? I look like I'm 

		    trying too hard.  I was going 

		    to get a haircut but then I 

		    thought I'd look like I just 

		    got a haircut.

			   (checks his teeth, 

			    peers up his nose)



				 JONAH

			   (reading the letters)

		    This is a good letter, Dad.



				 SAM

			   (checks his fly, looks 

			    down at his feet)

		    The heels on these shoes are 

		    very large.  Why have I never 

		    noticed this? The heels on 

		    these shoes are grotesque.



				 JONAH

		    Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.



				 SAM

		    Now I'm late.  Bye.



	He starts toward the door.



				 JONAH

		    Listen to this --



				 SAM

		    Not now, Jonah --



				 JONAH

		    Just this one part, okay?

			   (reading)

		    "I have been an excellent 

		    third-baseman for as long as I 

		    or anyone else can remember, 

		    and I guarantee you will not

		    Jonah, I'm leaving --



				 JONAH

		    WAIT!!!

			   (Sam stops, amazed at 

			    Jonah's vehemence; 

			    Jonah continues 

			    reading)

		    -- "and while we're on the 

		    subject, let's just say right 

		    now that Brooks Robinson was 

		    the best third baseman ever.  

		    It's important that you agree 

		    with me on that because I'm

		    greatest.



	Sam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the 

	letter.

		    It's a sign.

		    Oh, right.



	Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back 

	into the house.



				 SAM

		    Come here.  I want to show you 

		    something.



	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT



	As Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is 

	hanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah 

	in front of it.



				 SAM

		    Here is Seattle.

			   (moves his finger 

			    across the country)

		    And here is Baltimore.  Case 

		    closed.

			   (he pulls the map and 

			    it snaps back up)



				 JONAH

		    She doesn't want us to go to 

		    Baltimore.  She wants to meet 

		    us in New York City on 

		    Valentine's Day.  On top of the 

		    Empire State Building.



				 SAM

		    Perfect.  We'll be there.



	Sam goes out the door.  Jonah just looks down at his 

	letter, his hopes on hold.  Clarise switches the TV back 

	to Geraldo.



	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT



	Sam sits at a table.  Nursing a beer.  A little nervous.  

	He looks up and spots:



	VICTORIA



	walking into the place.  She's attractive.  She waves 

	and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer 

	from the maitre d'.



	After a beat.



				 SAM

		    Hi.



				 VICTORIA

		    Hi.



	An awkward pause.



				 SAM

		    You look good.



				 VICTORIA

		    You look good yourself.



	Another pause.



				 VICTORIA

		    I thought you were never going 

		    to call me.



				 SAM

		    You did?



				 VICTORIA

		    I really wanted you to call me, 

		    and I thought you were never 

		    going to --



				 SAM

		    You could have called me --



				 VICTORIA

		    No way.  No way I was going to 

		    be the first woman you went out 

		    with after...

			   (she gestures 

			    helplessly)

		    There is no percentage 

		    whatsoever in being the first 

		    woman anyone goes out with 

		    after...



				 SAM

		    You are the first woman I'm 

		    going out with.



				 VICTORIA

		    Oh.



				 SAM

		    So whatdya say? I'll get the 

		    check, and I'll call you in 

		    eight months.



	Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically.



				 VICTORIA

		    Oh, you are funny --



	We hear a CLICK as the image FREEZES.

		    Tell me he's living in squalor.  

		    Tell me everything he has is 

		    being repossessed, including 

		    his filthy, dented mobile home.



				 WHEEDLE

		    He's got a houseboat.



				 ANNIE

		    I hate boats.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It sounds nice.



				 ANNIE

		    Boats.  You go out in them.  

		    You come back in them.  I hate 

		    them.



				 WHEEDLE

		    Houseboats don't go anywhere.



				 ANNIE

		    Boats.  All anyone talks about 

		    is the wind.  Is it up, is it 

		    down.  I can't live with a man 

		    who only talks about the wind.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It's not a boat boat.  It's 

		    really a house.



				 ANNIE

		    But it's on the water.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It's on the lake right in the 

		    middle of Seattle.

			      (beat)

		    It rains nine months of the 

		    year in Seattle.



				 ANNIE

		    I hope I don't have to pay for 

		    that piece of information.



				 WHEEDLE

		    No, that's free.  He's an 

		    architect.  Used to do big 

		    high-profile projects.  He 

		    scaled it all back when his 

		    wife died.  Now he remodels 

		    people's homes.  He works in 

		    a small firm, makes a good 

		    living.



	He shows her a good picture of him.



				 ANNIE

		    He's real.



	She goes to the next shot.  Sees a picture of Sam and 

	Victoria in the restaurant, although all we see of 

	Victoria is her back and mane of blond hair.



	Hold on Annie's face.



	INT. SEATTLE MARKETPLACE



	With its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost 

	identical in design to the Baltimore marketplace.



	Sam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking 

	around, slightly distracted.



				 JONAH

		    I figure we could go to New 

		    York, catch the Knicks, and 

		    since we'd be there anyway, 

		    obviously we'd go to the Empire 

		    State Building --



				 SAM

		    There she is.



	As Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of 

	groceries.



				 JONAH

		    Why is she bringing that bag?



				 SAM

		    She's going to cook something 

		    for us?



				 VICTORIA

		    Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- 

		    you must be Jonah.



				 JONAH

		    Hi.

			   (back to the subject)

		    He should book now because we 

		    can get an excursion fare.  

		    Jessica's parents are travel 

		    agents and --



				 SAM

		    Not now, Jonah.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - LATER



	Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, 

	finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked.



				 SAM

		    We can't finish the job.  She's 

		    on her sixth painter, now she's 

		    thinking maybe she wants the 

		    fireplace rebricked --



				 VICTORIA

		    I know her pretty well.  Maybe 

		    I could call her --



				 SAM

		    I've already solved it.  I've 

		    hired a hit man.



	Victoria laughs a little too hard.



				 VICTORIA

		    Oh that is so funny, you are so 

		    funny.



	Sam smiles.  Jonah is appalled.



				 SAM

		    Every time she wants to change 

		    something, she talks in this 

		    little baby voice --

			   (in a little baby 

			    voice)

		    "Couldn't you just move the 

		    stairway a teeny tiny bit?"--



	Victoria almost dies laughing.  Jonah's eyes narrow to 

	slits.



				 JONAH

		    Do you like baseball?



				 VICTORIA

		    Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has 

		    box seats for the Mariners.  

		    Why don't we all go next week?



				 JONAH

		    What about camping?



				 VICTORIA

		    What about it?



				 JONAH

		    Do you like it?



				 VICTORIA

		    I went camping once.

			   (to Sam)

		    I love to brush my teeth in a 

		    brook and floss with a weed.



				 JONAH

		    We ought to start camping 

		    again, Dad.



				 SAM

		    Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.



				 JONAH

		    It's only ten o'clock.



				 SAM

			   (a little edgy)

		    Jonah!



				 JONAH

		    Okay.



				 SAM

		    Thank Victoria for dinner.



				 JONAH

		    Thanks for dinner.  I never saw 

		    anybody cook potatoes that way.



				 SAM

			   (gracious)

		    I'm glad you liked it.  Good 

		    night, Jonah.



	They watch as Jonah pads down the hallway.

	Jonah has snuck downstairs and is peeking out the window

	Victoria runs her finger down Sam's arm.



	Jonah is horrified.



	He dashes over to the phone and begins to dial.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	A sleeping Annie and Walter are startled awake by the

		    Turn on your radio!



				 ANNIE

		    What?



				 BECKY

			   (through filter)

		    The kid is on.  You've got me 

		    listening to this garbage.  

		    Go on, turn it on.



				 WALTER

		    Who is it?



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, it's just Becky, she's 

		    having trouble with Rich again.

			   (into phone)

		    Hold on, Becky, I'm going 

		    downstairs.



	She puts the phone on hold and gets out of bed.



	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT



	As Annie comes in and turns on the radio and picks up 

	the phone.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    This is a complete disaster.  I 

		    wanted him to find a wife, but 

		    he's got the wrong one --



				 ANNIE

		    How am I going to explain this 

		    to Walter?



				 BECKY (V.O.)

		    Shhh, listen to this --



	Annie takes the portable radio and the telephone 

	receiver, opens the broom closet and closes herself 

	inside.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Shouldn't your father be the 

		    judge of whether she's right 

		    or wrong?



	ON JONAH



	sneaking glances out at Sam and Victoria as he talks.  

	Victoria puts her arms around Sam's waist and clasps 

	them behind him.



				 JONAH

		    Please, please don't make me 

		    sick.  He's not sane enough to 

		    judge anything.  She's a ho.



	ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BROOM CLOSET, WITH THE TELEPHONE 

	CORD LEADING INTO IT.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

			   (muffled slightly)

		    My dad's been captured by a ho.



	Suddenly Sam happens to look over to the window.  Jonah 

	ducks down behind the desk before Sam sees him.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware 

	that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them.



				 VICTORIA

		    Is he there?



				 SAM

			   (turning back)

		    No.

			   (beat)

		    After he was born, every time 

		    we started to make love, he 

		    would cry.  He had an uncanny 

		    sense of timing.  We really 

		    shouldn't do anything here 

		    anyway.



				 VICTORIA

		    Absolutely.  Right.



	And she moves in to kiss him.



	ON JONAH



	Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the 

	coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a 

	kiss.



				 JONAH

		    Oh God, it's major.  He's 

		    kissing her on the lips.  I 

		    have to stop this.



	ON BROOM CLOSET



				 ANNIE

			   (muffled)

		    Come on, Jonah --



				 BECKY (V.O.)

		    Do something --



	ON JONAH



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Jonah, you can't butt in here.



				 JONAH

		    Yes, I can.



	He hangs up the phone and SCREAMS.



							CUT TO:



	ANNIE AS THE BROOM CLOSET DOOR OPENS.



	SHE SCREAMS.



	It's Walter.



				 WALTER

		    Miss Scarlett.  In the broom 

		    closet.  With the radio.



				 ANNIE

			   (to Becky)

		    I gotta go.  I'll see you at 

		    work.

			   (she hangs up, turns 

			    off radio)

		    Walter, you scared me.  Don't

	Sam looks at Victoria, shrugs.  Back to Jonah.



				 SAM

		    What are you doing up?



				 JONAH

		    I was thirsty.



				 SAM

		    There's a bathroom upstairs.



				 JONAH

		    The water tastes better in the 

		    kitchen.



				 SAM

		    That's true.  Why is that?



	INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT



	As she and Walter go upstairs to bed.



				 ANNIE

		    Becky heard this woman on the 

		    radio complaining about this 

		    guy she was sure was Rick, 

		    which meant he was cheating on 

		    her.  She was completely 

		    hysterical.  Then it turned out 

		    the woman lived in Duluth.



				 WALTER

		    That doesn't make any sense.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.  It makes no sense at 

		    all.  Thank God my life is in 

		    place.

				 JONAH

		    You think so?



				 JESSICA

		    It's Y. O. H.



				 JONAH

			   (agreeing)

		    Yeah.

			   (a beat)

		    What's that?



				 JESSICA

		    Your only hope.



	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY



	Annie, at her computer, talking to Becky.



				 ANNIE

		    I thought I would look into 

		    doing a story about those radio 

		    shows.



				 BECKY

			   (nods; after a beat)

		    You'd probably have to go 

		    somewhere to really look into 

		    it.



				 ANNIE

		    Definitely.



	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER



	Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox.  As Jonah opens the

				 SAM

			   (angry)

		    Get in the car right this

	Jonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica.

	Jonah gets in.



	INT. SAM'S CAR - CONTINUOUS



				 SAM

		    Did you call that radio station

				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    Everyone at work heard you.



				 JONAH

		    I just called for a second.



				 SAM

		    Long enough to call Victoria a 

		    ho.



				 JONAH

		    It's a short word.



				 SAM

		    This is not a joke.  Thank God 

		    Victoria doesn't know.  It 

		    would really have hurt her 

		    feelings.



				 JONAH

				 ANNIE

		    Not for the kind of place I

				 ANNIE

		    Do you believe that any lie is 

		    a betrayal? That's what Harold 

		    Pinter says, but it seems to me 

		    it's a very harsh way of 

		    drawing the line.



	Annie turns back to the window, leaving the seatmate, 

	who in any case doesn't speak English, completely 

	mystified.



	INT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



	Jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate, 

	watching Sam as Victoria checks in for a flight bound 

	for Minneapolis.



				 VICTORIA

			   (turning to Jonah)

		    Can I bring something back for 

		    you? A souvenir?

			   (to Sam)

		    Does he like those little snow 

		    scenes?

			   (to Jonah)

		    You know -- you shake them up 

		    and the snow floats down?



	Sam looks at Jonah, threateningly.  Be nice or else.



				 JONAH

			   (extremely polite)

		    Sure.  I'd really like that.  

		    Thank you so much.



				 VICTORIA

		    Well...



				 JONAH

		    I think they're announcing your 

		    flight.



	Sure enough, passengers are starting to board.



				 SAM

		    He's ten.



				 VICTORIA

			      (he's good at it)

		    He's good at it.



				 SAM

		    I read an article about this

		    ...



				 VICTORIA

		    I read the same article...



				 SAM

		    It takes time --



				 VICTORIA

		    Absolutely.  When I come back, 

		    maybe the two of us should 

		    spend some time together, on 

		    our own.  What do you think?



				 SAM

		    Sure.  Sure.



	Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway.  

	As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his 

	finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.



				 SAM

			   (impatiently)

		    Jonah, this isn't fair.  You 

		    don't know Victoria.  I hardly 

		    know her myself.  She is, in 

		    fact, a mystery to me.  She 

		    tosses her hair a lot.  Why 

		    does she do this? I have no 

		    idea.  Is it a twitch? Does 

		    she need a haircut? Should she 

		    use barrette so it doesn't 

		    keep falling in her face? 

		    These are things that I'm 

		    willing to get to the bottom 

		    of, and that is why I am dating 

		    her.  That is all I am doing.  

		    I am not marrying her.  Can you 

		    appreciate the difference? 

		    That's what single people do, 

		    they try people on and they see 

		    if they fit.  But nobody fits 

		    perfectly, everyone is an 

		    adjustment.



				 JONAH

		    Was Mom an adjustment?



				 SAM

			   (complete exasperation)

		    I'm never going to meet anyone 

		    who's going to measure up to 

		    your mom in your eyes? What do 

		    you think? There's a perfect 

		    woman walking around out there?



	At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next 

	to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us.



				 SAM

		    There's no such thing as a 

		    perf --



	Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by 

	her looks, her fluidity, her poise.



	Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches 

	from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit.  

	Sam continues to stare at her.



				 SAM

			   (to himself, referring 

			    to Annie)

		    God, she's beautiful.



				 JONAH

			   (unaware he's talking 

			    about Annie)

		    Victoria? She's okay.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to 

	lose sight of Annie.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, I was talking to Jessica 

		    about reincarnation, and she 

		    thinks that probably you knew 

		    Annie in another life.



				 SAM

			   (completely distracted)

		    Who is Annie?



				 JONAH

		    The one who wrote us.



	Sam is preoccupied with Annie.  She takes a turn that he 

	doesn't expect.  He's having trouble keeping up, because 

	he has to wait for Jonah.



				 JONAH

			   (continuing)

		    But Jessica says you and Annie 

		    never got together in that 

		    life, and your hearts are like 

		    puzzles with parts out of them 

		    and when you get together the 

		    puzzle's complete.



	He's lost Annie in the crowd.  She's nowhere in sight.



				 SAM

		    God dammit.



	A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.  Jonah follows.  

	As they walk into the distance --



				 JONAH

		    The reason I know this and you 

		    don't is that I'm younger and 

		    purer so I'm more in touch with 

		    cosmic forces.



				 SAM

		    I sincerely hope you are not 

		    going to marry Jessica.

	Annie driving through the streets of Seattle, referring 

	continually to a map she has spread out on the passenger 

	seat, trying to navigate her way to the Baldwin houseboat.

	Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the 

	Baldwins' marina.  She stops, blocking the driveway to 

	the marina.



	ON ANNIE IN HER RENTAL CAR



	checking the map.



	Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.  She looks 

	into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in 

	their van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into 

	their driveway.



	Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and 

	speeds away, tires squealing.



	EXT. SEATTLE GAS STATION - DAY



	Annie's car is parked just outside the rest room.



	INT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY



	Annie's in the Ladies' Room, splashing some water on her

	She settles on the matter-of-fact reading.

	ON ANNIE



	watching.  She's at a safe distance, across the street 

	and down some from the marina entrance.  She watches it 

	for a moment, then gains courage.  She starts to cross 

	the street to enter the dock.



	EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS



	Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat.  Nervously.  Goes up 

	to the door.  Adjusts herself quickly and knocks.  No 

	response.  Let down, she's just about to walk away when 

	she hears a motor REV UP.



	Annie peeks around the side of Sam's houseboat and spots 

	Sam and Jonah heading out in their dingy.



	EXT. STREET NEAR MARINA - CONTINUOUS



	Annie races back to her car, jumps in and follows the 

	boat along the seashore drive.



	EXT. SEATTLE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS



	As we see Annie driving along the water as Sam and Jonah 

	chug along in the water.



	EXT. ALKI BEACH - ON SAM AND JONAH



	They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken 

	clamshells, like stones, across the surface of the water.  

	They're laughing, pointing, counting out the number of 

	skips, arguing over the merits of each throw.



	ON ANNIE



	checking them out from a phone booth next to the Snak Shak.



							DISSOLVE TO:



	ANNIE'S POV - ON SAM AND JONAH - LATER



	They're throwing a football.  Jonah catches it and 

	starts to pretend to score a touchdown, dodging and 

	feinting.  Sam tackles him and they tumble together on 

	the beach.



	CLOSE ON ANNIE



	watching.  The purity and innocence of this little scene 

	-- a father and son at play -- is affecting her more 

	than she ever could have imagined.  Their LAUGHTER 

	filters up to her.  Right to her heart.



				 ANNIE (V.O.)

		    I watched him play with his son 

		    at the beach.



	INT. ANNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT



	Annie's on the phone with Becky.  We cut back and forth

		    I couldn't do it.  How did I 

		    get here?



	INT. BECKY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Becky on the phone in bed.  And cut back and forth.



				 BECKY

		    You told a lie and got on a

				 ANNIE

		    That's not what I mean.

			   (beat)

		    I'm going back over there 

		    tomorrow and talk to him.  I 

		    am.



				 BECKY

		    Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.



				 ANNIE

		    Becky?



				 BECKY

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    Is this crazy?



				 BECKY

		    No.  That's the weirdest part 

		    about it.



				 ANNIE

		    Thank you.  I love you.



				 BECKY

		    I love you, too.



				 ANNIE

		    Good night.



	Annie hangs up the phone.  She turns off the light.  

	Moonlight coming through the window.  Hold on her.



	EXT. STREET NEAR MARINA - DAY



	Annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out.



	Sam's van pulls into a parking space.  Jonah in the 

	front with Sam.  They're diagonally across a four-lane 

	street.



	ON SAM AND JONAH



	As they start to get groceries out of the car.



	Annie watching.  This is it.  No chickening out this time.



	She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole 

	thing.  It's now or never.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock.



	Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and 

	rightness with every step.



	But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES:



	SUZY



	who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at 

	the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide -- 

	beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose 

	boys have just come back from the front.  Sam and Jonah 

	are overjoyed to see her.  Jonah breaks into a run, 

	nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings 

	up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped 

	when he started running.



	ON ANNIE



	She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.  

	In shock.  The scene in front of her is too horrible to 

	bear.



	ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA



	Sam catches up.  Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious 

	than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam 

	and hugs them both.



	ON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY.



				 SAM

		    God, it's wonderful to see you.  

		    Where's Greg?



				 SUZY

		    He's over at the boat show.  

		    He'll be by later.

			   (she looks around)

		    It's so beautiful here.



	ANNIE



	There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about 

	this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the 

	middle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all 

	she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.  

	She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --



	A TAXICAB



	coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.  

	Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van 

	bearing down from the opposite direction.  She steps 

	back to the middle line.



	The cab goes into a skid.  Annie freezes.



	Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.  

	The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.



	Annie screams.



	The cab stops inches from her body.  The van in the 

	other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.



	ON SAM



	responding.  He runs from the gate toward the near-

	accident.



	ON THE CAB DRIVER



	getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the 

	sidewalk.



				 DRIVER

		    Lady, what the hell are you 

		    doing?



	Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, 

	hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she 

	turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their 

	eyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw 

	in the airport.



				 SAM

		    Hello.



				 ANNIE

		    Hello.



	Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything 

	that's happened, bolts for her car.



	Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is 

	coming past and he can't cross the street.  Annie gets 

	into her car, starts and pulls away.  Sam stands there, 

	deflated.

		    I love that dream.



				 ANNIE

		    That was nothing compared to

				 BECKY

		    But he saw you, right?



				 ANNIE

		    He said hello.



	EXT. TOWNHOUSE - ON ANNIE & BECKY - DUSK



	As Annie leads the way to her door, from Becky's car.

		    And what did you say?



	Annie takes the mail from the mailbox on her way to the

		    hello.

	INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



	Becky and Annie looking at the television.



				 BECKY

		    It's a sign --



				 ANNIE

		    It's a sign I've watched this 

		    movie too many times.

			   (beat)

		    I'm so stupid.  From the minute 

		    I listen to that stupid program 

		    on the radio, I've been a 

		    complete jerk.



	She starts absently going through the mail, throwing 

	almost all of it away without even opening it.



				 BECKY

		    You don't know who she was, 

		    Annie --



				 ANNIE

		    I saw her.  She looked just 

		    like this --



	She shows Becky the photo of Victoria and Sam having 

	dinner.



				 BECKY

		    This is a photo of hair.



				 ANNIE

		    Well, it's the same woman.  And 

		    he was crazy about her.

			   (looking at one letter)

		    What is this?

			   (beat)

		    This is from Seattle.



	She opens the letter.



	Reads it.



	Looks up at Becky.



				 ANNIE

		    Becky?



				 BECKY

		    So I mailed your letter.



				 ANNIE

			   (reading the letter)

		    "Dear Annie: Thanks for your 

		    letter.  It was great.  We're 

		    very excited about meeting you 

		    in New York on Valentine's Day 

		    and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. 

		    Sleepless in Seattle."



				 BECKY

		    M.F.E.O.?



				 ANNIE

		    Made for each other.



	A long beat.



				 BECKY

		    It's cute.  It's like a little 

		    clue.



	Annie looks at her balefully.



				 BECKY

			   (continuing)

		    So he can't write.  Big deal.  

		    I mean, verbal ability is a 

		    highly overrated thing in a 

		    guy, and our pathetic need for 

		    it is what gets us into so much 

		    trouble.



				 ANNIE

			   (with resolve)

		    I'm going to run back to 

		    Walter's arms, if he's still 

		    have me.



				 BECKY

		    What about the letter?



				 ANNIE

		    It doesn't mean anything.  It 

		    was written before I went out 

		    there.  Before the ho.



	She puts the letter on an ashtray, takes a match and 

	lights it.  They both watch it burn.



	CLOSEUP ON THE FIRE



	And pull back to reveal:



	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	A fire is blazing in the wood-burning stove.  Suzy is 

	sitting with her husband Greg and Sam.  Jonah is in 

	evidence, curled up on the couch under some blankets, 

	asleep.  On the table near the couch is red construction 

	paper for valentines, doilies, magic markers, etc.



				 SUZY

		    You saw her in the airport and 

		    then here?



				 SAM

		    I tried to talk to her...

			   (he shrugs)

		    It was like I knew her.  Weird.



				 GREG

		    Well, at least you're out there 

		    seeing people again.  That's 

		    terrific.



				 SAM

		    Well, just one really.



				 SUZY

		    How's Jonah taking it?



				 SAM

		    It'll take him a while to come 

		    around.  A month ago he called 

		    one of those radio call-in 

		    shows and told them I needed a 

		    wife --



				 SUZY

			   (charmed)

		    You're kidding --



				 SAM

		    Now that I'm seeing someone, 

		    it's a whole other thing.



	ON JONAH



	he's not asleep after all.  He's been listening all 

	along.



				 SAM

		    He's become obsessed with 

		    some woman who wrote me --



				 GREG

		    Are you serious?



				 SAM

		    She wants to meet me at the top 

		    of the Empire State Building.



				 SUZY

		    It's a little derivative.



				 SAM

		    What do you mean?



				 SUZY

		    "An Affair To Remember." Did 

		    you ever see it? Cary Grant 

		    and Deborah Kerr.  Before that 

		    it was called "Love Affair With 

		    Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."



				 GREG

		    Women love this movie.



	On Jonah, listening.



				 SUZY

		    They met at the Empire State 

		    Building, only they didn't.  

		    Never mind.



				 GREG

		    What kind of person would write 

		    to someone they heard on the 

		    radio?



				 SAM

		    I got hundreds of letters from 

		    women all over the country --



				 GREG

		    Desperate women --



				 SUZY

		    Just because someone's looking 

		    for a nice guy doesn't make 

		    them desperate.



				 GREG

		    How about rapacious and love-

		    starved?



				 SUZY

		    No.



				 GREG

		    It is easier to be killed by a 

		    terrorist --



				 SUZY

		    It is not --



				 GREG

		    Right, right.



	Suzy's irritated.



				 SAM

		    Anyway, Victoria's nice.



				 SUZY

		    Would you follow her through an 

		    airport?



				 SAM

		    Look, I met somebody.  She's 

		    good, and capable and smart.  

		    We hit it off.  We can't spend 

		    your life chasing after

		    I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I 

		    feel happy.  This is right.

		    You have to go to her, Jonah.  

		    You have to find her.



	Jonah nods.  But he isn't sure how he's going to do it.



				 JONAH

		    Do you know how much it costs 

		    to go to New York?



				 JESSICA

		    Nobody knows.  It changes 

		    practically every day.  How 

		    much money do you have?



				 JONAH

		    Eighty dollars.



				 JESSICA

		    I have forty-two.  So that 

		    would definitely cover 

		    taxicabs, I think.



				 JONAH

		    But how am I going to get 

		    there?

		    Honey, I'm going out for a few

			   (sticking her head in 

			    the door to the living 

			    room)

		    Could you keep an eye on things 

		    out front till I get back?



	Jessica looks over at Jonah.



				 JESSICA

		    Sure.



	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - TRAVEL AGENCY OFFICE - DAY



	Jessica is working on the computer.  She punches Jonah's 

	name into it.



				 JESSICA

		    Do you want an aisle or a 

		    window seat?



				 JONAH

		    Window.



				 JESSICA

		    Do you want a fruit plate?



				 JONAH

		    I don't know.  Do I?



				 JESSICA

			   (shrugs)

		    I'd rather die than eat on an 

		    airplane.

			   (beat)

		    I'm telling them you're twelve 

		    so you can fly unaccompanied 

		    and they won't make you be 

		    carried around by a stewardess 

		    and everything.



	Jonah nods.



	Now Jessica takes a ticket form out of the desk and 

	starts to fill it out for Jonah.



	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - TIFFANY'S - A SCULPTED GLASS HEART 

	- DAY



	formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in 

	pink light and spotlighted in white.



	Walter and Annie are among a few other people -- couples 

	mostly -- looking in the windows.  Each one a variation 

	on the heart motif.  They move to a window -- "Broken 

	Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out 

	of the wound in the middle.



	ON WALTER AND ANNIE'S REFLECTION



	in the Broken Heart window.



	They're both in their own worlds.  Then they both start 

	to speak at once.  They stop.  Annie looks at Walter.



				 ANNIE

		    You go.



				 WALTER

		    Ever since Christmas, you've 

		    been different.  Kind of 

		    distracted, distant.  But I 

		    feel like you're coming back 

		    from wherever you were.



				 ANNIE

		    I am.

			   (she smiles at him)

		    I was just... I just got... I 

		    think I got nervous.  It's 

		    normal, right? Don't you ever 

		    feel nervous about, you know?



				 WALTER

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    About forever.



				 WALTER

		    No.



				 ANNIE

		    Well, I did.  And you know what 

		    I think? I think that it was 

		    almost... too perfect.



	INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY



	As Annie and Walter walk through the jewelry department 

	to the elevator.



				 ANNIE

		    I started to wonder whether we 

		    were the human equivalent of 

		    two rights making a wrong, you 

		    know?



	Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely 

	good-natured about it.



	INT. THIRD FLOOR TIFFANY'S - DAY



	Annie and Walter are walking around the floor, followed 

	by a SALESWOMAN who is carrying a large white card on 

	which she is noting their selections.



				 ANNIE

		    It was like kismet but not, if 

		    you see what I mean.



	Walter's brow furrows slightly.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    You have to grow up.  You can't 

		    have all these adolescent 

		    dreams about how exciting your 

		    life is going to be --



	Walter starting to look puzzled.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    Don't hate me but I love this 

		    pattern.



			    	 WALTER

		    You couldn't.



				 ANNIE

		    I do.



				 WALTER

		    It's just like my grandmother's 

		    china.



				 SALESWOMAN

		    How many place settings should 

		    I put down?



				 ANNIE & WALTER

		    Ten.



	Walter beams at her.



				 WALTER

		    Exactly.  Eight is too few and 

		    twelve is too many.



	The SALESWOMAN writes a "10" on the big sheet of paper.



	INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY



	As Annie and Walter come out of the elevator on the 

	ground floor and WALTER stops for a moment at the 

	Jewelry Repair department, reappears with a little blue 

	Tiffany's box he gives to Annie.



	Annie opens it.



	Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring.



				 ANNIE

		    Walter.



				 WALTER

		    It was my mother's.



				 ANNIE

		    It's so beautiful.  It's just 

		    what I would have picked out if 

		    I'd had every ring in the world 

		    to choose from.

			   (as she slips the ring 

			    onto her finger)

		    You see what I mean.  There are 

		    people who would like a 

		    relationship to be full of 

		    surprises, but I am not one of 

		    them.

			   (as she starts out the 

			    door with Walter 

			    behind, thinking about 

			    what she has just 

			    said)

		    Surprises are highly overrated.



	As they go out the door to:



	EXT. FIFTH AVE.  - DAY



	As they start down the street and go off into the 

	distance.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    Promise me something, Walter.  

		    Promise me you will never have 

		    a surprise party for me.  Ever.  

		    You know what happens, you walk 

		    in the door in some horrible 

		    sweater you put on that morning, 

		    and there are hundreds of people 

		    in their best clothes shouting 

		    "Surprise!"



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Sam's got a suitcase on the bed, packing.  Jonah is 

	standing in the doorway, watching.



	He goes to his desk looking for something but can't find 

	it.  He tries a few drawers.



				 SAM

		    Have you seen my wallet?



				 JONAH

		    It might be in the kitchen.



	Sam doesn't remember leaving it in the kitchen.



				 SAM

		    I'm only going to be away one 

		    night, okay, and Clarise will 

		    be here.  You'll have a swell 

		    time.  You'll watch a little 

		    Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm 

		    Street 12, I'll never know.



				 JONAH

		    Are you going with her?



				 SAM

		    Yes.



	Jonah walks out of Sam's bedroom and we hear the door to 

	his bedroom slam shut.



	ON SAM



	Starting to boil.



	He walks into --



	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT



	And open the door to Jonah's room.



	INT. JONAH'S ROOM - NIGHT



				 SAM

		    I have to have a life.  I have 

		    to do things that I want with 

		    people my own age.  It's none 

		    of your business who I am going 

		    out with.  I don't give a good 

		    goddam if you're angry --



				 JONAH

			   (holding up Annie's 

			    letter)

		    This is the one I like.



	Sam starts back to his bedroom.



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS



				 SAM

		    I don't care who you like.  

		    It's who I like.  But the truth 

		    is you're never going to like 

		    anyone because it isn't your 

		    mother.



	Sam throws a pair of socks into the suitcase.



				 JONAH

			   (yelling)

		    Fine.  I won't say anything.  

		    You can marry Count Dracula.



				 SAM

		    Thank you, Jonah.  But the 

		    point is, I am not asking 

		    permission.



				 JONAH

			   (yelling)

		    What's wrong with Annie?



				 SAM

			   (emphasizing every 

			    word)

		    Shut up.



	Jonah appears at the doorway.



				 JONAH

		    Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never 

		    did that.  Mom never said shut 

		    up to me.  Mom never yelled at 

		    me.



				 SAM

		    This conversation is finished.



				 JONAH

		    You said we could go to New 

		    York.



				 SAM

		    Did not.



				 JONAH

		    Did too.



				 SAM

		    I can't know what I said, but 

		    we're not going.



				 JONAH

			   (crossing his arms 

			    across his chest)

		    I'm not leaving this room until 

		    you say yes.



				 SAM

		    Get out.



				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    Goddammit, I am sick of this 

		    --



	Sam picks Jonah up and carries him kicking and screaming 

	into:



	INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT



	and into:



	INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



				 JONAH

		    Put me down.  I hate you, I 

		    hate you --



	He throws Jonah on the bed.  Jonah in tears.



				 SAM

		    I'm sick of this phony 

		    melodramatic bullshit.  I'm 

		    sick of it.



	He leaves the room and slams the door.



	INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS



	Jonah weeping as Sam goes back to his bedroom.



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS



	The sound of Jonah weeping.



	Sam sits down on the bed, wiped out.  Hold on him.



	EXT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - MORNING



	As Clarise the babysitter arrives at the houseboat.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - MORNING



	Sam and Clarise in the hallway outside Jonah's door.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?  Clarise is here, okay? 

		    And I'm leaving.



	No response.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?

			   (to Clarise)

		    He's probably still asleep.



	He opens the door gently to the room.



	Jonah's gone.



	IN QUICK CUTS:



	Sam looks in the bathroom: no Jonah.  In the main cabin.  

	The back deck.  Out onto the docks.  Looking all up and 

	down.  Clarise coming down the deck -- she's apparently 

	been looking in the neighborhood.  As she shakes her 

	head no, Sam goes to the bicycle shed.  Jonah's bike 

	still there.  Sam stands on the deck.



	EXT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



	We see a group of people filing off an airport shuttle 

	bus.  The sign in front rotates from "Airport" back to 

	"Marina."



	Jonah comes down the stairs and steps off with his 

	Mariners backpack.  He just stands there a beat, looking 

	around.  Then he goes through the glass doors.



	INT. AIRPORT FIRST CLASS TICKET COUNTER - DAY



	The TICKET CLERK turns back to the counter.



				 TICKET CLERK

		    Next.



	Jonah steps forward, with his ticket.



	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - DAY



	Jessica is sitting defiantly in a chair in the middle of 

	the living room.  She is being interrogated but she is 

	not going to talk.  There's a clock on the mantel.  Sam 

	is in the room with Jessica's mother and father.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    Jessica, this is not 

		    acceptable.



				 JESSICA'S FATHER

		    If you don't tell us right now, 

		    right this minute, I'm going to 

		    kill you.



	Jessica rolls her eyes.



	She looks over the clock on the mantel.  As it ticks 

	to 8:30:



				 JESSICA

		    He's on his way to New York.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    What?



				 SAM

		    How?



				 JESSICA

			   (the child of travel 

			    agents)

		    United 597.



	Jessica's mother and father are horrified.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    Jessica!



				 SAM

		    When does it leave?



				 JESSICA'S FATHER

		    Eight-thirty.



	Everyone looks over at the clock.  It says 8:31.  

	Jessica smiles.



	INT. SAM'S CAR - DAY



	CLOSE ON SAM



	Driving to the airport.



	EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



	As his car takes the airport exit.



	INT. AIRPLANE - DAY



	A stewardess bends affectionately over Jonah, ensconced 

	in the first-class section.  He's got his backpack on 

	his lap and he's holding it.



				 STEWARDESS

		    Here you go... here's a nice pin 

		    for you, for flying with us.



				 JONAH

			   (completely unmoved, 

			    but polite)

		    Thank you.



				 STEWARDESS

		    You're welcome.  Can I take 

		    that for you?



				 JONAH

			   (clutching it even 

			    tighter)

		    No.



	INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER - ON SAM - DAY



	at the reservations desk.  Desperation.



				 SAM

			   (frantic)

		    He's about this high, 90 

		    pounds, never combs his hair, 

		    Mariner's hat --



				 AIRLINE CLERK

			   (to his colleagues)

		    Anyone check in a 

		    unaccompanied minor on the New 

		    York flight?



				 FIRST CLASS TICKET CLERK

		    I did.



	Sam closes his eyes.



				 SAM

		    I'll kill him.

			   (beat)

		    I have to get to New York as 

		    fast as I can.



				 AIRLINE CLERK

		    We can get you on a flight to 

		    Chicago and you can change 

		    planes --



	Starting to punch information into the computer.



				 AIRLINE CLERK

		    How will you be paying for 

		    this?



				 SAM

			   (taking out his wallet)

		    American Express.

			   (there's no American 

			    Express card in his 

			    wallet)

		    Visa.

			   (beat)

		    I really am going to kill him.



	INT. O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY



	As Sam comes out of the plane from Seattle and dashes 

	through the concourse, managing to arrive at the plane 

	for New York at the very last moment.



	INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY



	As Jonah comes out of the plane from Seattle and looks 

	up to see which way to go.  He looks very small.  Big 

	New York passengers in a hurry whiz by with their 

	carryons dangerously flying at their sides.



	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - A FEW MINUTES LATER



	Jonah stands in a taxi line.



	INT. TAXI - A FEW MINUTES LATER



	Jonah sits down in the back seat.  Looks up.  A big 

	bruiser of a CAB DRIVER leans back over the seat, sizing 

	Jonah up.



				 TAXI DRIVER

		    Where to?



				 JONAH

		    Empire State Building.



	INT. PLANE TO NEW YORK - DAY



	Sam is in an aisle seat.  He closes his eyes and 

	squeezes them tight.



				 SAM

			   (to himself)

		    Come on... come on... come on... 

		    COMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEON...



	EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - AFTERNOON



	It looks magnificent in the waning afternoon light.



				 CABBIE'S VOICE

		    There it is.



	We are watching from:



	INT. A TAXICAB



	where Jonah, with his head out the window, regards the 

	building with awe.



				 CABBIE

		    What are you gonna do there, 

		    spit off the top?



				 JONAH

		    No.  I'm gonna meet...

			   (trying to figure out 

			    what to call her)

		    my mother.



	INT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK



	Walter and Annie walking toward their table with the 

	MAITRE D'.



	Annie sits down, looks at the view.  Walter starts to 

	sit, revealing a spectacular view of the EMPIRE STATE 

	BUILDING directly behind him.  Annie's smile fades.



				 WALTER

		    Is something wrong.



	Annie shakes her head.



				 MAITRE D'

		    May I get you a drink?



				 WALTER

		    Some champagne?



				 ANNIE

		    Fine, fine.



	Walter glances back over his shoulder.



				 WALTER

		    Beautiful view, isn't it?



				 ANNIE

		    Walter, there's something I 

		    have to tell you --



	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DUSK



	As Sam rushes out of the terminal.  Desperate.



	A cab pulls up.  Sam bolts to the head of the line and 

	muscles his way into the cab.  The other people in line 

	are irate.



				 SAM

		    Sorry, this is an emergency.



	The cab pulls out to a chorus of verbal abuse.



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    Empire State Building.



	INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING LOBBY - DUSK



	Jonah, carrying his backpack, walks through the majestic 

	lobby and follows the arrow to the Observation Deck.



	EXT. TOP OF EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - HELICOPTER SHOT - DESK



	Looking down on the observation deck.  The city below.  

	The tiny figure of Jonah walks into the middle of the 

	deck.  Looks around.



	EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DUSK



	Sam's cab speeds across the bridge and into Manhattan, 

	heading for the Empire State Building.



	INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DUSK



	Jonah is going to take the bull by the horns.  He walks 

	up to a likely-looking WOMAN.



				 JONAH

		    Hi, I'm Jonah.  Are you Annie?



				 WOMAN #1

		    No.

			   (smiles at him)

		    I'm Cynthia.



	He spies another unattached woman.



				 JONAH

		    Excuse me, are you Annie?



	EXT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK



	A helicopter shot of Annie talking animatedly to Walter.



	And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is 

	actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in:



	EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - DUSK INTO 

	NIGHT



	Jonah is looking through the viewfinder.  He turns 

	around, forlorn.  He takes off his backpack and is about 

	to sit down next to it when Sam bolts into the 

	observation deck.



	Jonah leaps into his arms.



				 SAM

		    You're my family.  You're all 

		    I've got.  What if something 

		    happened to you?



	Sam's eyes well up.  Jonah starts to cry.



				 SAM

		    What if I couldn't get to you?



				 JONAH

		    I was scared of what you were 

		    gonna do.



				 SAM

		    When I found you?



				 JONAH

		    If I didn't go.



				 SAM

		    Listen, have I ever done 

		    anything really stupid?



				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    I mean, so far, have I screwed 

		    it up for you?



				 JONAH

		    No.



	The two of them hold each other tight.  After a beat:



				 SAM

		    I can't believe you flew first 

		    class.



				 JONAH

		    It was all they had.



	INT. RAINBOW ROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter.  There's champagne in their glasses, 

	but neither of them has drunk a drop.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know what to say about 

		    it, Walter.  It was a form of 

		    temporary insanity.  But I had 

		    to tell you about it because --



				 WALTER

			   (matter-of-fact)

		    -- it was a betrayal.



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It 

		    was just...



				 WALTER

		    So what happened?



				 ANNIE

		    I told you.  Nothing --



				 WALTER

		    At the top of the Empire State 

		    Building --



				 ANNIE

		    I'm not at the top of the 

		    Empire State Building.  I'm 

		    here.



				 WALTER

		    Not really.

			   (beat)

		    Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's 

		    leave that out of it.  I don't 

		    want to be someone you're 

		    settling for.  I don't want to 

		    be someone anyone settles for.

			      (beat)

		    I have a life insurance policy,  

		    I'm fully invested in growth 

		    stocks, I have a paid 

		    subscription to Home Rox 

		    Office, I have no sexual 

		    diseases, I have been steadily 

		    employed in a part of the 

		    economy that isn't soft, I have 

		    expectation in the way of 

		    inherited wealth, I dress 

		    nicely, I am a member of the 

		    private sector, an independent 

		    voter, I don't watch Monday 

		    Night Football, the only thing 

		    wrong with me is that I am 

		    allergic to wheat, 

		    strawberries, penicillin, 

		    pollen, nuts and wool.  There 

		    are plenty of women who see me 

		    as the brass ring.  If you 

		    don't -- marriage is hard 

		    enough without bringing such 

		    low expectations into it, isn't 

		    it?



	Annie is nodding.  She wipes a tear from her face.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve 

		    you.



				 WALTER

		    I think that's what I'm saying.



	Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off 

	her finger and hands it to Walter.



	No bitterness here.  Both of them trying to be gentle 

	with each other.



				 ANNIE

		    You okay?



				 WALTER

		    Yes.

			   (beat)

		    Some people will do anything to 

		    get out of going to a symphony.



	This breaks the tension.  Both of them smiles.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh!



				 WALTER

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    Look!



	Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie 

	sees:



	THE LIGHTS HAVE JUST GONE ON ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING 

	VALENTINE LIGHTS:



	A huge pink and white heart.



	Walter turns back to Annie.



				 WALTER

		    Go for it.



	And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. WEST 50TH STREET - NIGHT



	As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab.



	As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave.



	INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT



	The lights are on all over the city.



	The crowd has thinned out considerably.  Jonah and Sam 

	are among the last people left.  They gaze out at the 

	twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky.



				 ELEVATOR OPERATOR

		    Last call.  Closing time.



	Jonah looks at Sam.



				 JONAH

		    This is pretty dumb, wasn't 

		    it?



	Sam shrugs.



				 SAM

		    Big deal.



	After a beat.



				 SAM

		    Maybe we'll get a dog when we 

		    get back.



				 JONAH

		    Okay.



				 SAM

		    What do you mean, okay? 

		    Wouldn't you like a dog?



				 JONAH

		    Sure.



	Sam puts his arm around him, they start toward the 

	elevator.



				 SAM

		    Let's go home.



	EXT. FIFTH AVE - NIGHT



	Annie's cab stuck in traffic.



	As Annie gets out of the cab.



	She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State 

	Building.



	INT. LOBBY OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT



	Annie sprints in and over to Information Booth.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators

				 ANNIE

			   (out of breath)

		    No.  Please.  I really need to 

		    get up there.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    We're closing up.  No more runs 

		    tonight.



	Annie takes a deep breath.  She's hit the end of the 

	road.  She turns to go but then turns back.



				 ANNIE

			   (out of breath)

		    Listen, can I just take a look? 

		    Maybe... maybe... There's 

		    someone I was supposed to 

		    meet... He's probably not 

		    there, but if I don't at least 

		    look I'll always wonder about 

		    it.



	The Information Booth Person looks at her.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    Cary Grant, right?



				 ANNIE

		    You know that movie?



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    One of my wife's favorites.



	INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING



	After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very 

	empty platform.



				 ELEVATOR MAN

		    Sorry, ma'am.  Empty.



	Annie slowly walks out.



				 ANNIE

		    Can I take a minute?



				 ELEVATOR MAN

		    Go ahead.



	She sighs.  Heads for the telescopes.  Looks out at the 

	twinkling lights below.



	She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees 

	something on the floor.



	Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack.



	She picks it up.  She realizes that it might be... 

	could be... and opens it.  Inside is a toothbrush and 

	Jonah's teddy bear.  As she takes out the bear the other 

	elevator DINGS.



	Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator.



				 JONAH

		    I left it near the...



	And they stop.  There she is.  There they are.  Sam 

	can't believe it.  It's the mystery woman.



				 SAM

		    It's you.



				 ANNIE

		    It's me?



				 SAM

		    The one in the street.  I 

		    chased after you.



				 JONAH

		    Are you Annie?



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.



				 SAM

			   (confused)

	    You're Annie too?



	She smiles awkwardly.



				 ANNIE

			   (indicating the 

			    backpack)

		    Is this yours?



	Jonah walks over to her.  He puts his hand out.  She 

	shakes it solemnly.



				 JONAH

		    I'm Jonah.

			   (nodding back to Sam)

		    That's my dad.  His name is 

		    Sam.



				 ANNIE

		    Hi, Jonah.  Sam.

			   (indicating the teddy 

			    bear)

		    And who is this?



				 JONAH

		    Howard.



				 ANNIE

		    Howard.



	Sam nods.  Smiling.  Starting to put it all together.  

	Annie smiles.  Still nervous.  No one knows what to do 

	next.  Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS 

	HIS THROAT.



				 SAM

		    We better go.



	Annie nods.



	Sam holds out his hand.



				 SAM

		    Shall we?



	Annie slips her hand into his.  It feels comfortable, 

	natural, right.



				 ANNIE

		    Sam?



	He looks at her.



				 ANNIE

		    It's nice to meet you.



	On Annie.



	On Sam.



	On Jonah.  He makes a triumphant little double-fist 

	gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.



	EXT. THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT



	WE SEE THE BUILDING from above, all lit up, a romantic 

	confection, the world's largest Valentine.



	The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see the United States 

	spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere.

1   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 1

    An expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold
    taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes.
    Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of
    thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on
    the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other
    side.

                               JAVED O/S
              Salim! Salim!


2   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. DAY.                              2

    Darkness. Then, glimpses of faces. In the half-light,
    shadowy figures move with purpose. An implacable voice
    announces.

                            TALKBACK V/O
              Ten to white-out, nine, eight,
              seven...

                               PREM
              Are you ready?

    Silence. A hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly.

                            PREM (CONT'D)
              I said are you ready?

                               JAMAL
              Yes.


3   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 3

    The thumping at the door continues. The sound of
    mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand
    cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the
    chamber, snaps the chamber shut.

                            TALKBACK V/O
              ...three, two, one, zero. Cue
              Prem, cue applause...

    Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.
    A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...


4   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       4

    ...we are back in the studio, the gun-fire morphing
    into rapturous applause.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                2.

                                  TALKBACK V/O
                 Go, Prem.

    A wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage.
    Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On
    stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man
    stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for
    the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem
    Kumar.

                               PREM
                 Welcome to Who Wants To Be A
                 Millionaire!

    More applause.

                               PREM (CONT'D)
                 Please give a warm welcome to
                 our first contestant of the
                 night- a local from our very own
                 Mumbai!

    Under cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal
    towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.

                                  PREM (CONT'D)
                 Smile, dammit.

    The lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a
    tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him
    ferociously across the face. Then again and again.
    Blood trickles from his mouth.


5   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. NIGHT.                               5

    The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the
    harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung
    from the ceiling by his arms.

                               CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                 Your name, bhen chod.

    Constable Srinivas's hand pulls back Jamal's head by
    the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the
    lights.

                                  CONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D)
                 Your name!

                                  JAMAL
                 Jamal Malik.

    And seamlessly we are back....

                                                           3.


6   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         6

    ...on the set of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Prem
    leans back in his chair, a man at home in his
    surroundings. Jamal sits opposite, frozen.

                            PREM
              So, Jamal, tell us a bit about
              yourself.

    Close on Jamal's face. Without warning, it is shoved
    under water.


7   INT. BUCKET. NIGHT.                                         7

    We look up from the bottom of the bucket at the
    screaming face of a drowning man. His head shakes
    desperately, pointlessly. Then Jamal's face is dragged
    up again, roaring for breath. Close on his eyes.

                            JAMAL V/O
              I work in a call centre. In
              Juhu.


8   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         8

                            PREM
              A Phone-basher! And what type of
              call centre would this be?

                            JAMAL
              XL 5. Mobile phones.

                            PREM
              Aha! So, you're the man who
              rings me up every single day of
              my life with Special Offers,
              huh?

                            JAMAL
              No, actually, I'm an assistant.

                            PREM
              An Assistant Phone-basher?

    A raised eye-brow at the audience. Amusement ruffles
    through them.

                            PREM (CONT'D)
              And what does an Assistant Phone-
              basher do, exactly?

                            JAMAL
              I- I get tea for people and-

                                PREM
                  - a chi-wallah! Why didn't you
                  say?

     Laughter in the audience.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  So, ladies and gentlemen, Jamal
                  Malik from Mumbai, let's play
                  Who Wants To Be A
                  Millionaire...!

10   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.                          10

     Jamal's body dangles motionless from the ceiling. His
     head is bowed and he is moaning to himself. The ceiling
     fan thumps round slowly. In the corner, Constable
     Srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. Hot
     work. The door opens and the Inspector of Police walks
     in. A rumpled man in his late forties who has seen
     pretty much everything. He eyes Jamal, surprised.

                                INSPECTOR
                  Has he confessed, yet?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Apart from his name, I can't get
                  a word out of the runt.

                                INSPECTOR
                  You've been here all bloody
                  night, Srinivas. What have you
                  been doing?

     Srinivas shrugs.

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Tough guy.

                                INSPECTOR
                  A little electricity will loosen
                  his tongue.

     Constable Srinivas brings a box and a tangle of wires
     out of a cupboard and proceeds to put crocodile clips
     on Jamal's fingers. The Inspector stares, deep in
     thought. Sweat trickles down his face. He wipes it away
     with a handkerchief, seems to be talking to himself.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Every night I get home, "why
                  can't we have a/c like Bajan
                  Chacha?
                                (MORE)

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Why don't you care about your
                  poor family, dying in this
                  heat." Twenty-four years a
                  policeman and I can't afford
                  bloody a/c.

     Turns on Jamal.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  But you. You've got ten million
                  rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar?
                  And who knows how much further?
                  Fancy the twenty million, do
                  you?

     Jamal just stares.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  I think you probably do.

     The Inspector nods absently to Constable Srinivas who
     turns a handle. Jamal's body pulsates and jerks. He
     screams. His body goes limp again. The Inspector goes
     over to Jamal.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  So. Were you wired up? A mobile
                  or a pager, correct? Some little
                  hidden gadget? No? A coughing
                  accomplice in the audience?
                  Microchip under the skin, huh?

     Constable Srinivas hadn't thought of that. Grabs
     Jamal's arms and starts squeezing them all over until
     the Inspector has had enough.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Srinivas! Look, it's hot, my
                  wife is giving me hell, I've got
                  a desk full of murderers,
                  rapists, extortionists, assorted
                  bum-bandits...and you. Why don't
                  you save us both a lot of time?
                  Hmm?

     Jamal doesn't answer. The Inspector sighs and sits
     down. Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas
     again. Jamal's body jerks with electric current. When
     the shudders and screams have subsided, the Inspector
     goes over to Jamal's collapsed form. Clicks his fingers
     in front of Jamal's face to check for a response.

                                INSPECTOR OF POLICE
                  He's unconscious, chutiya. What
                  good is that? How many times
                  have I told you-?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Sorry, Sir.

     An excited Young Police Constable sticks his head
     around the door.

                             YOUNG CONSTABLE
               He's coming! Sir.

                             INSPECTOR
               Aré wa, Srinivas, we'll have
               Amnesty International in here
               next, peeing their pants about
               human rights. Get him down, tidy
               him up, for God's sake.

     Constable Srinivas goes over to Jamal and starts to
     undo the crocodile clips.

                             CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
               Maybe he did know the answers.

                              INSPECTOR
               Have you gone soft, Srinivas?
               Professors, lawyers, doctors,
               General Knowledge Wallahs never
               get beyond sixteen thousand
               rupees. And he's on ten million?
               What the hell can a slum dog
               possibly know?

     Jamal lifts his head.

                              JAMAL
               The answers.

     He lifts his head, spits blood out of his mouth and
     says again, straight into the Inspector's face.

                             JAMAL (CONT'D)
               I know the answers.

     Titles. Slum Dog Millionaire.


11   EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.                                  11

     Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present
     Mumbai dust. A group of children are playing cricket on
     a tarmac cricket ground. They are bare-foot, dressed in
     little more than rags, wiry-skinny and fast on their
     feet. Salim, a nine-year old, polishes the ball on his
     almost non-existent shorts, comes in with surprising
     speed and bowls. The batsman hooks it high in the air.
     The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield.

                             SALIM
               Jamal! Catch it! Catch it!

     The seven-year old Jamal stares up at the ball, jinks
     around trying to get into position.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            7.
11   CONTINUED:                                                  11

     He pays no heed to the rest of the children who are
     scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. The ball
     seems suspended in the blue sky. Shouts from the other
     children seem very far away. He doesn't notice that
     they are screaming for him to get out of the way. Jamal
     adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of
     nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as
     it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is
     knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The
     ball bounces away. Also flattened, Salim gets to his
     feet.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  How could you drop that? It was
                  a sitter.

     Then Salim's face turns to one of alarm.


12   EXT. AIRPORT PERIMETER. DAY.                                12

     At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of
     wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running
     for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly
     nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming
     abuse and wielding a long stick. The kids dash across a
     rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes
     that run in between the shacks of the slum.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Private-ka land! Private-ka
                  land! The planes won't kill you,
                  mader chod, I will!

     Jamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off,
     head down a separate lane. The Guard pursues them.


13   INT. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                        13

     The lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are
     three feet wide, with an open drain running down the
     middle. Many of the precarious upper floors of the
     shacks have been built right over the paths, turning
     them into black tunnels. Tunnels shot through with
     slivers of light. If you didn't live here, you would be
     lost and frightened in minutes.

     But these children are natives and with the practice of
     many years, Jamal and Salim zig-zag down the warren of
     lanes.

     They dodge past people cooking in the doorways,
     sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a
     naked four year-old, pissing into the drain. Salim
     shouts a warning.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          8.
13   CONTINUED:                                                13

                                SALIM
                  Vinod! Musketeers coming
                  through!

     Without breaking step, they both jump expertly over the
     stream of piss. Not so the Security Guard who gets it
     all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit.

     The two children charge past a shack filled to the roof
     with chickens in cages who all start squawking. They
     break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the
     slum lined with shops. It is packed: with people,
     stalls, bicycles and cows. All modern India is here,
     drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food,
     playing carom, video games. Leaving a trail of shouting
     and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new
     Mercedes almost blocking the lane. Beside it stands
     Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his
     two Minders. Jamal and Salim skid to a stop, put their
     hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so
     carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car.

     Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides
     carefully past the car with deprecating bows and
     smiles. On past the chi stall where a crowd has
     gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv
     rigged up overhead. The irate Security Guard gets
     tangled up in a bicycle. Jamal and Salim stop to give
     him a taunting, hip-gyrating parody of the dance on the
     tv before scooting down another tunnel. They break out
     into sunlight again.

                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                  Jamal!

     Jamal skids to a halt, bumping into Salim who is
     already frozen.

                                JAMAL
                  Shit. Mummy-ji.

                                JAMAL'S MOTHER
                  Don't you move a muscle.

     The Security Guard arrives and he too skids to a halt
     at the sight of Jamal's mother.

                                JAMAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Thank you, Mister Gupta. I will
                  deal with these two.

     The Guard puts his hands together in grudging respect
     as Jamal's Mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor
     by their t-shirt and marches them down the road.

                                                            9.


14   INT. SCHOOL. DAY.                                           14

     The two renegades are dumped by Jamal's Mother into
     their desks as Mister Nandha hands out ancient school
     books.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               So, the musketeers return. We
               are honoured. Salim. Or Porthos,
               isn't it?

     He crashes the heavy book down on his head. Salim opens
     the book. Jamal glances over and turns the book the
     right way round for Salim.

                             SALIM
               I know!

     Mister Nandha hovers over Jamal's head. He winces in
     anticipation.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               And Athos.

     The book comes down like thunder. Jamal blinks from the
     impact and suddenly we are back....


15   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               15

     ... in the Inspector's office. Jamal watches Srinivas
     fiddling with the video recorder, trying to get a
     picture. Through the pebbled glass, Jamal sees shapes
     moving along the corridor.


16   INT. CORRIDOR. POLICE STATION. DAY.                         16

     The Commissioner of Police is fawning along beside Prem
     as they walk. The Young Constable hurries behind.

                             COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
               It is so kind of you to visit
               our station, Sir. A great
               honour.

                             PREM
               Not at all, not at all. I hope
               you will visit us, Commissioner.

     Out of his jacket pocket comes a couple of tickets.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Bring the family. It's a lot of
               fun.

                             COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
               Oh! A thousand thanks, Sir.
               Missus Janda will be overcome.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             10.
16   CONTINUED:                                                    16

     He turns to the Young Constable.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                                (CONT'D)
                  chi, you lazy chutiyé, chi!

     The Inspector joins them in the corridor.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                                (CONT'D)
                  Ah, Inspector! Cracked it?

     The Inspector moves his head. Maybe yes, maybe no.

                                  INSPECTOR
                  Nearly, Sir.

     The Commissioner is just able to contain his apoplexy.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                  Nearly? Nearly? When Prem Kumar
                  himself has-

     Prem holds up a tolerant hand to the Commissioner who
     falls silent. Turns his laser-like charm onto the
     Inspector.

                                PREM
                  Inspector. How good to meet you.
                  Clearly the kid cheated.

                                  INSPECTOR
                  Clearly, Sir.

                                PREM
                  So, it is just a question of
                  how, no?

                                INSPECTOR
                  Indeed, Sir. The proof. That is
                  all we need.

                                PREM
                  We are lucky to have a man of
                  your obvious experience on the
                  case. This kid might run rings
                  around us filmi types, but he
                  won't make fools out of the
                  Mumbai Police Force, I can see
                  that.

     Forced laughter from the Commissioner.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  In front of sixty million
                  people.

     More laughter. And fear.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.
16   CONTINUED: (2)                                              16

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Which is what will happen if we
               don't get a result, Gentlemen.
               He goes back on the show to rob
               us all with the whole of India
               watching. But. I can rely on
               you.

     Prem walks away down the corridor. Stops and turns,
     apparently casual.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Has he- has he made any
               allegations?

                                INSPECTOR
               Allegations?

                             PREM
               He's a cunning one. A convincing
               liar. Don't be taken in,
               Inspector, don't be taken in.

     Walks off. The Inspector stares after him. Goes back
     into his office.


17   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE.                                    17

     Srinivas has finally got the recorder to work. We get
     snatches of filmi dancing- heroines singing on
     mountainsides surrounded by implausible numbers of
     flags- cricket and finally after some shouting by the
     Inspector, Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?.

                             INSPECTOR
               So, Mister Malik, the man who
               knows the answers. Talk.

     We close in on the tv screen where Prem is smiling his
     crocodile smile and find ourselves....


18   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         18

     ...as Prem asks the first question.

                             PREM
               So, are you ready for your first
               question for one thousand
               rupees?

                                JAMAL
               Yes.

                             PREM
               Not bad money to sit in a chair
               and answer a question. Better
               than making the tea, no?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           12.
18   CONTINUED:                                                  18

                                  JAMAL
                  No. Yes. No.

                                PREM
                  No. Yes. No. Apka final answer?

     Laughter from the audience. Jamal looks confused. Prem
     waves it away, switches on his serious face.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Remember, you have three
                  lifelines if you're not sure of
                  your answer- Ask the Audience,
                  50/50 and Phone a Friend. So,
                  the question:

     The lights go down, the portentous music rolls.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Who was the star of the 1973 hit
                  film Zanjeer. Was it A-

     Close on Jamal's eyes.


19   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                          19

     A tiny shack. A garland of dirty plastic flowers
     surrounds a torn flyer for one of Amitabh Bacchan's
     films.


20   EXT. JUHU SLUM. RUBBISH DUMP. NIGHT.                        20

     Salim is sitting on a chair at the end of a rickety
     wooden pier, though it is not water, but a sea of
     rubbish and sewage that lies below them. There are
     dozens of these piers protruding from the slum onto
     airport land, each with a toilet shack perched right at
     the end. Another man hurries up the pier and hands
     Salim a coin.

                                SALIM
                  Immediately, sir.

     Turns to the toilet door.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Bhai, get out of there. Prakash
                  wants a shit.

                                  JAMAL O.S.
                  Not finished.

                                PRAKASH
                  Stop your time-pass. This is
                  urgent.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          13.
20   CONTINUED:                                                 20

                                JAMAL O.S.
                  It's a shy one. Since when was
                  there a time limit on a crap?

                                SALIM
                  Since there was a customer
                  waiting, that's when.

     He flashes another placatory smile at Prakash.

                                JAMAL O.S.
                       (singing/ grunting)
                  Come on out, you beauty, unveil
                  yourself, my darling-warling....

                                PRAKASH
                  Look, kid, I got a bad stomach.
                  It's borderline....

     A disturbing combination of heaving and snake-charmer
     noises come from the toilet shack. Finally Prakash can
     stand it no longer.

                                PRAKASH (CONT'D)
                  I'm off to Devi's bog. Give me
                  that.

     He snatches the coin back from Salim and hurries off.
     Salim bangs on the toilet door.

                                SALIM
                  You just lost me good money, you
                  stupid idiot-

     Salim stops. In the distance, there is the faint sound
     of shouting, a crowd coming closer. Then the crowd
     bursts through the outer shacks of the slum, pour onto
     the rubbish dump and make for the airfield.

                                MAN
                  It's Amitabh! That's his
                  helicopter!

                                JAMAL O.S.
                  Amitabh? Amitabh Bacchan?


21   INT/EXT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                    21

     Jamal peers through one of the many cracks in the
     shack. He sees crowds surging around the pier, charging
     towards a landing helicopter. Salim shoves the chair
     under the door handle- effectively locking it- and runs
     down the pier to join the chase. Jamal pulls up his
     shorts.

                                JAMAL
                  No! Wait! Salim, sala! Salim!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

21   CONTINUED:                                                  21

     Rattles the locked door. Pulls a torn flyer from his
     pocket advertising an Amitabh movie.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Wait! Amitabh....

     He looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath
     him, the landing helicopter, the disappearing crowd. A
     final rattle of the door. There is only one way out. He
     jumps down the hole, sprawling headlong into a year's
     worth of human waste, managing to keep the flyer out
     the mire. He runs for the helicopter.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Amitabh-ji! Amitabh-ji!

     Salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a
     way through, but the adults shove him back. Not so for
     Jamal. The down-draft from the helicopter flicks bits
     of sewage from his clothes. Disgusted fans curse him
     and get out of his way. Suddenly, the red sea parts and
     there is nobody between Jamal and Amitabh Bacchan
     getting out of the helicopter.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Please. Amitabh-ji.

     Jamal holds out his flyer. Used to signing autographs,
     the movie star barely looks at Jamal. He takes the
     flyer and scribbles his autograph on it.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  A thousand thanks, Amitabh-ji.

     He hands the flyer back to Jamal as his bodyguards
     surround him and hustle him into a car. Jamal chases
     the flyer across the tarmac, grabs it. Kisses it.


22   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                      22

     From high up, the rickety tin roof-tops of the slum
     seem to stretch to the horizon. There is a distant
     shout, a figure waving an arm.

                                 MAN
                  It's coming!

     Then another shout and another, a chain of voices
     coming closer. People come out of their doorways with
     pails and buckets. The shouts come closer until we see
     a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and
     singing in the lane. Jamal is the happiest boy in the
     slum.

                                JAMAL
                       (singing)
                  Amitabh, Amitabh, oh Amitabh!

                  I have your autograph, oh, holy
                  Amitabh!

                                   MOTHER
                  Here it comes!

     Water comes bubbling through a hose and Jamal's mother
     hoses down her ecstatic son.


23   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                    23

     Not far away, Salim wanders to Mister Chi's stall. He
     glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the
     hindi film on Mister Chi's tv and surreptitiously slips
     Mister Chi the signed flyer. Mister Chi takes a look
     and gives Salim a small wad of rupees. He sticks the
     money in his pocket, slinks away.


24   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                    24

     A tear-stained Jamal is furiously trying to batter
     Salim, but Salim's extra strength and height means that
     he can keep Jamal at bay with one hand, Jamal's
     flailing fists punching thin air.

                                   JAMAL
                  Sala! Sala!

     Salim's laughter only makes Jamal cry harder.


25   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                           25

     Close on the tv screen in the Inspector's office. Prem
     ponders Jamal's choice. Presses a button on his
     computer.

                                PREM V/O
                  You chose A- Amitabh Bacchan.
                  Guess what? You just won one
                  thousand rupees!

     Applause on screen. The Inspector looks at Jamal. Jamal
     shrugs.

                                JAMAL
                  You don't have to be a genius.

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  I knew it was Amitabh.

                                   JAMAL
                  Like I said.

     Constable Srinivas twists Jamal's arm behind his back,
     evincing a squeal of pain from Jamal.

                  He's the most famous man in
                  India...!

     The Inspector stares at Jamal, turns back to the tv
     where Prem is asking the next question.

                                PREM O/S
                  For four thousand rupees....the
                  national emblem of India is a
                  picture of three lions. What is
                  written underneath? Is it...

                  B) Lies alone triumph. C)
                  Fashion alone triumphs. D) Money
                  alone triumphs.

     Prem shoots a mock puzzled look out to the audience
     eliciting giggles from them.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  What do we think, Jamal? The
                  most famous phrase in our
                  country's history. Maybe you
                  want to phone a friend?

     Laughter from the audience. The studio lights bear down
     on Jamal. a drop of sweat trickles down his forehead.
     Prem is loving his discomfort.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Or Ask the Audience? I have a
                  hunch they might just know the
                  answer. What do we think?

     He gestures expansively at his audience. Oh, they love
     him.

                                 JAMAL
                  Yes.

     Prem whistles. Raises his eyes at the audience.

27   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                             27

     The Inspector presses pause. Sighs.

                                INSPECTOR
                  So, Jamal. My five-year-old
                  daughter knows the answer to
                  that, but you don't. Strange for
                  a millionaire genius. What
                  happened? Your accomplice nip
                  out for a piss, did he? Or did
                  he just not cough loud enough?

     Silence. Constable Srinivas kicks Jamal's chair.

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  The Inspector asked you a
                  question.

                                JAMAL
                  How much is bhelpuri at Jeevan's
                  stall on Chowpatty Beach?

                                INSPECTOR
                  What?

                                JAMAL
                  One bhelpuri. How much?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                       (can't help
                        himself)
                  Ten rupees.

                                JAMAL
                  Wrong. Fifteen since Divali. Who
                  stole Constable Varma's bicycle
                  outside Dadar Station last
                  Thursday?

                                INSPECTOR
                       (amused)
                  You know who that was?

                                JAMAL
                  Everyone in Juhu knows that.
                  Even five year-olds.

     Despite himself, the Inspector laughs. Then leans in.

                  hundred percent would have made
                  me a little more reassured,
                  maybe....

     Prem shrugs, makes a show of examining his computer.
     Suddenly fixes him with his eyes.

31   EXT. DHOBI. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                 31

     Right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty
     water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are
     washing clothes. Trains flash past only feet away from
     them. Down the other end of the pond, nine-year old
     Jamal and Salim are splashing noisily with some other
     children. Jamal's mother pauses in her scrubbing, wipes
     sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky.

                                JAMAL AND SALIM'S MOTHER
                  It's going to come. Today. I can
                  feel it.

     The woman next to her nods.

                                WOMAN
                  Hope so. My head is exploding.

                                MOTHER
                  Yes. We need rain.

     Jamal is trying to intercept the ball that Salim and
     Krishna are throwing to each other. He's not having
     much success. The ball flies overhead again from Salim
     to Krishna. Jamal dives for it, misses and goes
     underwater. When he comes up for air, he shakes his
     head, clearing his ears of water. Then he stops,
     listens. Shakes his head again. Definitely something
     strange. Thunder? Salim and Krishna are trading
     catches, unaware that anything has changed. But Jamal's
     mother has heard it too. The faintest sound of
     shouting, roaring. The wave of noise is still faint but
     getting louder. A frozen moment broken by:

                                MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Run! Jamal, Salim, run!

     Everybody stares at her. A train speeds through as she
     continues to shout, her words lost beneath the
     thundering train.

                                MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Go! Run!

     The train goes through, the last carriage flying past
     suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men
     wielding clubs, scythes, metal bars. They come
     screaming across the railway tracks.

                                SALIM
                  Krishna, quick!

     Salim holds out his hand to Krishna who is wading with
     difficulty through the water.

                                KRISHNA
                  No way! You're a bloody Muslim.
                  Get away from me!

     The rioters leap the tracks and are upon them.

                                KRISHNA (CONT'D)
                  They're Muslims! Him and him!

                                MOTHER
                  Go!

     Salim and Jamal scramble out and retreat into the
     lanes. Salim turns to see his Mother felled by a
     rioter. She is surrounded by screaming, chanting men
     who rain blows down on her. Jamal runs back and drags
     Salim down an alley. As they head down the alley, they
     get glimpses of burning houses, fleeing women, a three-
     year old boy in a doorway, painted entirely in garish
     blue. He stares at them. In his hand, he is carrying a
     bow and arrow. An eleven-year old girl dressed only in
     a pair of pants runs after them.

                                                         21.

     She has two bleeding red gashes on her back. They turn
     a corner and head towards some vans full of police.
     Jamal sees Mister Nandha, the school teacher, stops.

                                JAMAL
               Salim!

     Then Mister Nandha starts walking towards him. An oasis
     of calm in the chaos. Jamal looks at him with relief.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
               Mister Nandha.

     Mister Nandha smiles, walks towards them.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               Ram nam satya hai, Babri Masjid
               dhvasth hai.

                                JAMAL
               Mister Nandha?

                             MISTER NANDHA
               We have destroyed your mosque.
               Now, the followers of Ram will
               drive you dogs out of our city.

     From behind his back he produces a knife and runs
     towards Jamal, screaming.

                             MISTER NANDHA (CONT'D)
               Ram has returned to his temple!
               Ram has returned!

     They flee, but Jamal turns, sees the girl, frozen. He
     chases back a few steps, hauls her arm. The spell
     broken, and they are off.


32   INT. STREET. EVENING.                                     32

     They reach the safety of the police vans. But inside
     the vans, the police are smoking, laughing, playing
     cards. Down the street, a man comes whirling out of a
     doorway, his hair on fire. He falls into the middle of
     the street and is engulfed by rioters. Unperturbed, the
     police continue to chat. Salim and Jamal look on,
     horrified. Then one of the police men turns, looks at
     them. Is interested. Motions to a colleague. Puts out
     his cigarette with purpose.

                             JAMAL
               Let's go, bhai.

     Salim and Jamal run. The girl follows.

                                                        22.


33   EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                     33

     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.
     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly
     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.

                              JAMAL
                We should go back.

     Silence.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                See if Ama-

     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a
     moment. But only a moment.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                What about Jeevan Chacha?

     Salim shakes his head.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                Maybe he-

     Salim shakes his head again.

                              SALIM
                - I saw him. He was with them.

                              JAMAL
                But he wouldn't hurt-

                              SALIM
                - he was with them!

                              JAMAL
                But-

                              SALIM
                - shut up, Jamal, can't you?
                Just shut up!

     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and
     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps
     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds
     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                Ja!

     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across
     the city. Rain begins to come down.

                              JAMAL
                What shall we do?



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           23.
33   CONTINUED:                                                  33

     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a
     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their
     faces.


34   INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                 34

     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes
     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,
     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,
     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap
     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the
     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.

                                SALIM
                  Go away. Ja, ja!

     The girl might not even have heard.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  She'll have the Security Guard
                  onto us, standing there.

                                JAMAL
                  Not if we let her in.

                                SALIM
                  No.

                                JAMAL
                  She could be the third
                  musketeer.

                                SALIM
                  I am the head of this family,
                  now. And I say no. Piss off,
                  you.

     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal
     follows suit.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  We don't even know what the
                  third musketeer's called.


35   EXT. JUHU SLUM. DAY                                         35

     A flash of Jamal's mother being clubbed to the ground.
     Her scream.


36   INT. BUILDER'S YARD. LATER.                                 36

     Jamal wakes with a jolt and a scream half-swallowed in
     his mouth. He shuts his eyes tight, trying to force the
     image out. His breathing slows and he sees the girl
     staring at him. Salim, too, is staring into nothing.
     The rain is still falling.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           24.
36   CONTINUED:                                                  36

     The girl goes back to drawing shapes in the mud with
     her finger. Jamal climbs out of the pipe. Looks at
     Salim for permission or refusal, but he just continues
     to stare. So, Jamal walks across to her. She looks up,
     wary.

                                JAMAL
                  Where's your Mother?

     Silence.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Father?

     The girl shakes her head slightly. Jamal takes the
     plastic sheet from around his shoulders. Gives it to
     her.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  I'm Jamal. He's Salim.

                                  LATIKA
                  Latika.

     Jamal goes back to his water pipe, climbs in. Watches
     her huddled under the sheet. Sighs, motions for her to
     join him. She darts across, jumps into the water pipe
     and huddles up next to Jamal.


37   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               37

     Jamal looks at the Inspector.

                                JAMAL
                  I wake up every morning wishing
                  I didn't know the answer to that
                  question? If it wasn't for Ram
                  and Allah, I would still have a
                  Mother.


38   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT                                          38

                  Final answer?

                                  JAMAL
                  Final answer.

     Prem stares at him for dramatic effect. Presses his
     computer.

                                PREM
                  Computer-ji, D lock kiya-jaye.

     The lights dim, the music swells.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Jamal Malik, you answered D? Ram
                  is depicted with a bow and arrow
                  in his hand. And guess what?
                  You've just won sixteen thousand
                  rupees! Well done, my friend.
                  Time for a commercial break-
                  don't go away, now.

     Music, applause. Prem switches off his professional
     smile. Gets up.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Got lucky, huh? I'd take the
                  money. You'll never get the next
                  one.

                                JAMAL
                  You're from the Juhu slum,
                  aren't you?

                                PREM
                  Hmm? Sure. Know where I live
                  now, kid? Pali Hill. Twelve
                  bedrooms, a/c in every room, two
                  kitchens, a gym and a screening
                  room. Steel balls is what it
                  takes, my friend, steel balls.

     The Floor Manager comes over and gives his head-phones
     set to Prem. Prem listens.

                                DIRECTOR V/O
                  Prem? Tone it down, for goodness
                  sake. You're making him a
                  laughing stock.

     Prem glances up at the gallery with contempt.

                                PREM
                  We're having fun here. They love
                  it...Where the hell do you get
                  them from?

     He makes no attempt to hide the conversation from
     Jamal.

                                DIRECTOR V/O
                  It's supposed to be a quiz show,

               one. Promise.

     He chucks the head-phones back at the Floor Manager.
     Glances in the wings. Sees Nita, the make-up woman.
     Gets up and goes over.


39   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                             39

     In the half-light, backstage, Nita dabs his face with
     powder.

                             PREM
               Meet me after the show. Please.

                             NITA
               No.

                             PREM
               Nita, I can explain.

                             NITA
               No need. I read it in bloody
               Stardust. Didn't even have the
               balls to tell me. "Prem's
               happiness with another baby on
               the way". After everything you
               said...

                             PREM
               Baby, it all happened before I
               met you. I swear to you.

                             NITA
               She's got the gestation period
               of an elephant, then.

     Prem is about to object. But instead, he laughs.

                             PREM
               You see? Amidst all this misery,
               only you can make me laugh.

     Scornful but hints of melting.

                             NITA
               All this misery...

                             PREM
               Her and I- nothing. You have to
               believe me, baby...

                  I can't. Without you, it's all
                  pointless.

     Clicks his fingers at the Floor Manager.

                               PREM (CONT'D)
                  You. Tell the Director.

     Nita shakes her head at the Floor Manager who by now is
     looking very worried.

                  Okay, Juhu boy, you've had a
                  good run. Take your Mother to
                  Khandala and eat some chiki.

                  Well, your girlfriend then. Even
                  better.

                                JAMAL
                  I don't have a girl-friend.

                  Yes.

                                PREM
                  Then, let's play.

     Portentous music. The lights dim.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  For sixty-four thousand rupees.
                  The British architect Frederick
                  Stevens designed which famous
                  building in India? Is it: A) The
                  Taj Mahal. B) Chhatrapati
                  Shivaji Terminus. C) India Gate.
                  D) Howrah Bridge. What do you
                  think, Jamal? Are you one of
                  those tea-boys with a penchant
                  for architecture?


41   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   41

     Known to everyone as VT station, this monument to
     Victorian railway architecture is a dangerous place to
     be at rush hour.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

     Even before the train has stopped, men are jumping from
     the open doors, or vaulting out of the windows or from
     the roof of the train to join the tens of thousands of
     Mumbaites streaming to and from work. A seventeen-year
     old Jamal squeezes himself out of a train and shoves
     through the crowds. He checks the time. The digital
     numerals flick to five O'clock. Looks around the tide
     of humanity.


42   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         42

                                PREM
                  So, what's it to be? Walk away
                  and this cheque for sixteen
                  thousand rupees is yours. Look,
                  it's even got your name on it.

     He produces a cheque and waves it at Jamal.

                                JAMAL
                  I don't have a bank account.

     Laughter from the audience. Prem is momentarily wrong-
     footed.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  But I'll take cash.

     More laughter, this time with Jamal, rather than at
     him. Prem gets up and starts rummaging theatrically
     through his jacket pockets and trousers.

                                PREM
                  Nope. Looks like the Producer's
                  stolen my wallet again-

                                 JAMAL
                  - I'll play.

     Nobody was expecting this. Least of all Prem who has to
     rearrange his features into one of surprised delight.
     He sits down.

                                 PREM
                  You'll play?

                                 JAMAL
                  Why not?

                  Well, well, well. We've got a
                  wild one, here.

     Prem tears up the cheque with theatrical slowness.

43   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   43

     The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the
     descending river of people out of his way, the eighteen
     year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps that cross
     the platforms. He pushes to the middle of the
     footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He scans
     the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her: the
     eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly beautiful,
     over the other side of the station. A world away. She
     is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

                                JAMAL
                  Latika! Latika!

     But though he is screaming her name, his voice is
     swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two
     thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Latika!

     Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one
     figure against an army of white-robed people.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Latika!

                  Sure?

                                JAMAL V/O
                  I think so.

                                PREM V/O
                  You think so. A brave man,
                  Ladies and Gentlemen, a brave
                  man.


44   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   44

     The commuters have mostly gone. Jamal is pacing the
     platform desperately. He stops, stares blankly at the
     statue in front of him- a proud, rather pompous figure
     in a Victorian frock coat. The plaque reads: Frederick
     Stevens.

                                                        31.


45   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                           45

     The Inspector, Srinivas and Jamal are staring at the
     video recorder.

                             JAMAL
               Yes. Final answer. Chhatrapati
               Shivaji Terminus.

                             PREM
               Is the right answer! Sixty-four
               thousand rupees to you, Sir!

     Applause and music. The Inspector presses pause. Stares
     at Jamal.

                             INSPECTOR
               And did she come back?

     Jamal smiles sadly.

                             JAMAL
               I wouldn't be here if she had.

                             INSPECTOR
               Pretty was she?

     Jamal stares down at his feet.

                             INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
               Guess not.

     Right in the eyes.

                             JAMAL
               The most beautiful woman in the
               world.

     Constable Srinivas snorts. Suddenly, Jamal is out of
     his chair and at Srinivas' throat. The combined force
     of the Inspector and Srinivas force him roughly back
     down. He is again handcuffed to the chair.

                             INSPECTOR OF POLICE
               Well, well. The slum dog barks.
               Money or women. The reason for
               most mistakes in life. Looks
               like you got mixed up with both.
               Srinivas, you need the exercise:
               a trip to VT Station to check on
               the statue. And lock your bloody
               bike up.

     Constable Srinivas swears under his breath but bumbles
     out.

                  Now, man to man. How did you

                  million rupees...the song Chalo

                  Tempted to use one?

49   EXT. MUMBAI STREET. NIGHT.                                49

     Jamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out
     numbers from it. There is something not quite right
     about Jamal- perhaps the fact that there are two feet
     by his ears. Salim is standing on his shoulders and
     spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a
     certain lack of confidence.

                  with the stick going down, Salim-
                  six- stick going up-

     Latika's head appears from around the corner.

                                 LATIKA
                        (whispered)
                  Oi!

     But they don't hear. Then she is running for her life
     past the pair of them.


                                JAMAL
                  Six, one, shit, let's go-

     Salim collapses off Jamal's shoulders and all three run
     off down an alley past a dozen of the gang's sprayed-on
     adverts all reading: "Beanbags- 989 4909661". A fat
     Security Guard with a long stick huffs round the
     corner. Chases them up an alley. Nowhere to go except
     through an imposing gate that clearly leads to a
     private house.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Got you now, little shits.


50   EXT. GARDEN. NIGHT.                                        50

     They charge across the lawn, down one side of the house
     where all the washing is hanging. The Guard gets caught
     up in drying sheets, towels. He fights his way through
     to see Salim, Latika and Jamal leaping over the wall to
     safety. But Jamal turns, jumps back and grabs a girl's
     dress from the line.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Aha! Little thief!

     The Security Guard lands a couple of blows on Jamal's
     back as he dodges around him and back across the lawn,
     dress in hand. The Security Guard gives up.

                                SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)

                  I tried to warn you.

                                JAMAL
                  It's okay, Salim.

     Latika slips on the dress. Spins. Both of them look up.
     Stare. She pulls her hair back, smiles, is transformed
     into a beautiful girl.


52   EXT. GORAI BEACH DUMPING GROUND. DAY.                     52

     Blazing sun. Diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of
     rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for
     ever. Oblivious to the dust kicked up by the trucks,
     Latika is picking up old plastic bags, examining each
     one and putting the less worn in a big sack. The dress
     is recognisable but dusty and torn. She stoops to dig
     another bag out of the dirt, but stops and stares.
     Shimmering in the heat, a rickety pick-up truck comes
     through the rubbish dump gates. Toots at the Guard who
     waves, pulls up in the dump. "Hope Orphanage is written
     on the side of the van. A man gets out. Looks around.


53   INT. `TENT'. DAY.                                         53

     Under sheets of plastic propped up on sticks, Jamal and
     Salim are sleeping out the hottest part of the day.
     Jamal wakes to see a figure standing over him- a
     silhouette with a halo of sun behind him. Out of his
     bag, the man produces a bottle of Thumbs Up. He uncaps
     it with an alluring hiss. It is almost an advert for
     thirst-quenching affluence. Almost instinctively, Salim
     and Jamal stir.

                                MAN
                  Hello.

     He hands the bottle to Salim, gets another from his bag
     and waves it questioningly at Jamal.

                                MAN (CONT'D)
                  Hot, huh? My name is Maman.


54   EXT. ORPHANAGE. EVENING.                                  54

     The hills on the edge of Bombay. Greenery and space,
     for the first time in the film. The pick-up truck pulls
     up outside a building with Jamal, Salim and Latika
     sitting on a bench in the back. Maman gets out. Drops
     the gate on the back of the pick-up.

                                MAMAN
                  Anyone hungry? Come on in.

                                                          35.


55   INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                         55

     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a
     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and
     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He
     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with
     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning
     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks
     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or
     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on
     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.

                             JAMAL
               He must be a very good man to
               look after these people.

                             SALIM
                    (glancing at them)
               A saint.

     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim
     overhears.

                             ARVIND
               We're not allowed to talk to
               them.

                                LATIKA
               Why not?

     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman
     who is looking right at them.

                             LATIKA (CONT'D)
               Well, if there are seconds,
               Maman is definitely a Saint.

     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he
     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.
     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out
     laughing.

                             LATIKA (CONT'D)
               I tell you, Lord Siva is with
               us.


56   INT. ORPHANAGE. EVENING.                                   56

     Salim, Latika, Jamal and a group of children are
     standing in a line singing a doha- ancient lyrics set
     to music. Maman is leading the singing, walking up and
     down the line listening to each one individually. He
     stops at one small boy, Arvind, and listens. Nods his
     head, pleased, and continues down the line until he
     stops in front of Jamal. Holds up his hand.

                             MAMAN
               Stop! You. Again.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          36.
56   CONTINUED:                                                 56

     Jamal starts singing again. He has the sweetest of
     voices. Untrained but pure. Maman smiles, ruffles
     Jamal's hair, impressed.

                                  MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Everyone.

     They all join in. Maman continues down the line. He
     stops at Salim whose octave-slipping singing is lusty
     and appallingly out of tune. Maman winces and moves on.
     Standing next to Salim, Latika giggles. Immediately,
     Salim is on her. Before a fight breaks out, Punnoose
     pulls Salim off Latika and hurls him across the room.
     Salim gets up and charges at Punnoose. For a second,
     Punnoose is back-footed, but then pins Salim's arms to
     his side. Maman laughs. Approaches Salim.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  You sing like one, and you fight
                  like one. I think you've found
                  your dog, Punnoose.


57   EXT. CENTRAL MUMBAI TRAFFIC. DAY.                          57

     A group of children are sitting in the jumble of
     concrete under a motorway flyover. Cars surround them,
     bumper to bumper. Latika and Jamal are playing an
     improvised hopscotch on concrete slabs. They are
     giggling, bumping into each other, tickling, laughing.
     Salim and Punnoose are sitting together, smoking. Salim
     is staring hard at Jamal and Latika until Punnoose
     grunts, a sign for Salim to clap his hands.

                                SALIM
                  Okay, let's go, let's go! It's
                  not a bloody holiday!

     The children get to their feet. Latika sighs, puts a
     patch over her eye and grabs a pair of crutches.
     Suddenly, the lame beggar. Salim goes over to one of
     the girls, who is carrying a sleeping baby. Puts out
     his hand.

                                  SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Give me that.

     The girl shakes her head. Salim grabs her by the hair
     in one hand and takes the baby with the other. He
     shoves her to the ground. The other children stare.

                                  JAMAL
                  Hey, Salim!

     He challenges Jamal.

                                SALIM
                  What, choté bhai? You got a
                  problem?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        37.
57   CONTINUED:                                                57

     He laughs and walks over to Latika.

                                   SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Here. For you.

                                LATIKA
                  I don't want it.

                                SALIM
                  You'll earn double. I'm doing
                  you a favour, Latika.

                                JAMAL
                  She doesn't want it.

                                   SALIM
                  Chup, Jamal.

     Latika turns away and begins to walk towards the cars.

                                   SALIM (CONT'D)
                  I'll drop it.

     He holds the baby up. Latika grabs the baby with a cry
     just as Salim releases it from his hands. Salim pinches
     the baby.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Triple if it's crying.

     Latika snatches it away. Salim laughs, goes back to
     sitting with Punnoose. The children scatter to the cars
     trapped at the lights, tapping plaintively on the
     windows and making the universal begging gesture.


58   INT. ORPHANAGE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                           58

     Surrounded by beer bottles, Punnoose is slumped asleep
     by the kitchen door. Latika edges past, avoids the cook
     sleeping under the table and goes to a shelf laden with
     vegetables. She pulls down a bunch of chillies still on
     the vine, strips a few off and tip-toes out with them.


59   INT. ORPHANAGE. DORMITORY. NIGHT.                         59

     Sleeping children, three or four to a mattress on the
     floor. Latika tip-toes around the mattresses. She
     pauses over one in particular where we see Salim,
     asleep. She carefully pulls up the sheet, delves
     underneath. Pleasant dreams cross Salim's sleeping face
     for a second. Then suddenly, he is bolt upright and
     screaming. He charges around the room clutching his
     genitals in agony.

                                SALIM
                  Madher chod...!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           38.
59   CONTINUED:                                                  59

     He sprints out of the room, wailing.


60   INT. ORPHANAGE. SHOWERS. NIGHT.                             60

     The lights are on and two dozen children are screaming
     with laughter as Salim stands under the make-shift
     shower directing the water down his pants to his
     burning genitals, his face a picture of agony. Latika
     wipes crushed chillies from her hands.

                                SALIM
                  You're dead, sala.

     She smiles and walks past Jamal with a shrug. Then
     Punnoose comes stalking in and the children scatter
     away.

                                PUNNOOSE
                  Get back to bed, dogs! What the
                  hell...

                                JAMAL V/O
                  They taught me every song in the
                  history of Indian music.

                                INSPECTOR V/O
                  And why would they do that, I
                  wonder?


61   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                          61

     In a shack, Arvind is singing one of Surdas' bhajans in
     front of Maman and an old man who by his ragged
     appearance must be a villager. Punnoose and Salim sit
     behind Arvind.

                                MAMAN
                  Very good, very good. I am
                  pleased, Arvind. He is ready.

                                ARVIND
                  Ready?

     Maman nods to Punnoose. Before Arvind can turn round,
     Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after
     the briefest of struggles, Arvind's body goes limp. The
     villager puts an old tin box on the table. Taking the
     lid from the tin, he brings out a cloth and unwraps it.
     Inside is a spoon. He checks the edge with his thumb.
     Sharp. Douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and
     passes it over a candle flame. The spoon whooshes with
     a high flame for a moment. The villager wipes it with
     the cloth nods to Punnoose.

                                PUNNOOSE
                  Salim!

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           39.
61   CONTINUED:                                                  61

     Utterly bemused, Salim nevertheless helps Punnoose lay
     Arvind on the table. The villager takes hold of
     Arvind's eyelid and pulls it open. He brings the spoon
     close. Suddenly, Salim is being sick in the corner of
     the shack. By the time he has turned back, the villager
     is wiping the spoon on a blood-soaked rag.

                                MAMAN
                  Okay. Take him out the back.

     Punnoose picks up Arvind and carries him out.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Now the other one. Salim, go get
                  Jamal.

     A frozen moment.

                                SALIM
                  What?

                                MAMAN
                  Gunfighter Number One, isn't
                  that right, Salim? The money,
                  the women, the cars...you want
                  them bad, huh? And why not?

     Maman gets out of his chair. Approaches Salim.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  The time has come to choose,
                  yaar. The life of a slum dog or
                  the life of a man. A real man. A
                  gunfighter, Salim.

     Maman holds Salim's head in his hands.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Your destiny is in your hands,
                  bhai. You can be me. Or nobody.
                  Understand?

                                SALIM
                  Yes, Maman.

     Maman nods.

                                MAMAN
                  So, brother, go get Jamal.

     Salim is frozen for another few seconds, then turns and
     walks out of the door. Punnoose appears at the door.
     Maman nods to him and he slips off after Salim.


62   INT. DORMITORY, ORPHANAGE. NIGHT.                           62

     All the children are asleep apart from Jamal who is
     crouched underneath a couple of wash-basins.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          40.
62   CONTINUED:                                                 62

     He is talking through a plate-sized hole in the
     crumbling masonry. Latika's eyes can be seen.

                                JAMAL
                  ...weddings, government things,
                  big parties. If Maman says my
                  voice is ready. Big money.

                                LATIKA
                  Enough for a room?

                                JAMAL
                  Easily. Maybe an apartment.

                                  LATIKA
                  Really?

                                JAMAL
                  That's what Arvind said. On
                  Harbour Road. You, me and Salim.
                  The three musketeers.

                                LATIKA
                  Harbour Road! We can have ice
                  cream from Babanji's.

                                JAMAL
                  Every day if we want.

     Salim appears at the door. Nods his head at Jamal.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  It's my turn.

                                LATIKA
                  Good luck, Jamal.

     Latika's hand comes through the gap. Jamal takes it for
     a moment. Salim hisses at Jamal. He lets go of the hand
     and heads out.


63   EXT. PATH. NIGHT.                                          63

     Salim and Jamal walk along the path, Jamal humming
     happily. Salim checks behind him, sees Punnoose
     following.

                                JAMAL
                  So, this is it, hey, bhai? The
                  good life, here we come....

                                SALIM
                       (conversationally)
                  Athos.

     Jamal is suddenly alert. Slows


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        41.

                  Porthos?

     Salim nods. Big smile. Puts a hand on Jamal's shoulder.

                                  SALIM
                  When I say.


64   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        64

     Salim guides Jamal into the shack where Maman and the
     Villager are waiting. Maman smiles. Punnoose slips in
     behind Salim.

                                MAMAN
                  Jamal, hello. You have done
                  well. It's time for you to- turn
                  professional.

                                  JAMAL
                  Really?

                                MAMAN
                  Sing me a song, yaar. How about
                  Chalo Ri Murali, huh? My
                  favourite.

     Jamal opens his mouth, then closes it again. Holds out
     his hand.

                                  JAMAL
                  Fifty rupees.

                                  MAMAN
                  What?

                                JAMAL
                       (shrugs)
                  I've turned professional. What
                  can I do?

     Maman laughs.

                                  MAMAN
                  Sala...!

     He throws some notes at him.


65   EXT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        65

     Outside, a giggle. Latika is peering through a gap in
     the wall.

                                                          42.


66    INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        66

      Jamal begins to sing. Maman waits a while, then nods to
      Punnoose. Behind Jamal, Punnoose hands Salim the bottle
      of chloroform and the rag. Salim approaches the back of
      Jamal. Salim waits until he has finished the song.
      Raises his hand with the rag in it. Maman smiles, nods.
      Salim flings the contents of the bottle in Punnoose's
      face. Punnoose screams and stumbles back clutching his
      eyes, knocking over the table.

                                SALIM
                Go!

      Salim and Jamal scramble for the door. The knocked-over
      candle catches the spilled chloroform and a curtain
      which whooshes up in flame.

                                LATIKA
                Jamal!

                                JAMAL
                Run!


66A   EXT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        66A

      They charge past the prone Arvind- a flash of bloodied
      bandages covering his eyes.


67    EXT. HILLSIDE. NIGHT.                                     67

      Heavy, desperate breathing. Feet stumble on roots. Fall
      into holes. The three children are running. Branches
      smack into their faces. But they are so scared, nothing
      will stop them. Behind them, torches scour the
      undergrowth. Men shouting. They break out of the woods
      and are confronted with a train goods yard.


68    EXT. GOODS YARD. NIGHT.                                   68

      They run over the tracks, between the trains, but the
      shouts are getting louder, the torches closer. A diesel
      engine is moving out of the station. Jamal, Latika and
      Salim sprint for the Guard's Van at the very back of
      the moving train. Punnoose is closest to them. Salim is
      fastest and first to jump the train. He holds out his
      hand. Jamal grabs it and is hauled in. Jamal holds his
      hand out to Latika.

                              JAMAL
                Come on! Faster!

      She reaches out to him. Their hands almost touch.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             43.
68   CONTINUED:                                                    68

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Take it! Take it! I can't
                  reach...

     Salim barges Jamal out of the way. Jamal      stumbles back
     as Salim reaches his hand out to Latika,      so he doesn't
     see Latika's hand grasp Salim's, nor see      their eyes
     lock onto each other, nor see Salim very      deliberately
     let go of her hand. Latika stumbles.

                                LATIKA
                  Jamal!

     Jamal scrambles to the rail. The train gains more
     speed. Jamal climbs on to the top rung, makes to jump,
     but Salim flings him backward. Jamal tries to scramble
     to his feet again, but Salim restrains him.

                                JAMAL
                  Got to go back. We've got to go
                  back.

                                SALIM
                  He'll kill us if we go back.
                  Jamal! He was going to take your
                  eyes out- with a bloody spoon!

     The train is speeding along. Jamal breaks free and
     stares back at Latika.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  She'll be alright. She always
                  is.

     Latika stumbles again and stops running. They watch as
     Punnoose catches up with her and stops running. He
     smashes Latika to the ground.

                  question on, if you get the

     The lights dim, the music swells. Prem presses a button
     on his computer: looks him straight in the eyes for an
     age.

     Applause, music, lights.


70   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                             70

     The Inspector is eying Jamal, weighing it all up.

                                JAMAL
                       (shrugging)
                  Blind singers earn double. You
                  know that.

                                INSPECTOR
                  And what happened to the girl?
                  They blinded her too?

                                JAMAL
                       (shakes his head)
                  They had other plans. Though it
                  took me a long, long time to
                  find out.


71   EXT. TRAIN. MORNING.                                      71

     Salim and Jamal are sitting on top of the train. Jamal
     is staring blankly down the track.

                                  SALIM
                  Aré, Jamal...

     Salim puts an arm around Jamal's shoulder. Jamal wipes
     the tears from his eyes, shakes his head furiously.


     Salim gets up. Holds out his hand.

                                  SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Come.

                                JAMAL
                  Where you going?

                                SALIM
                  First class, bhai. Where else?

                                                        45.


72   INT/ EXT. FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE. MORNING.                  72

     The ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline. A
     middle class Indian couple with their three children
     are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before
     them. Into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes
     Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is
     clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train
     roof. He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim
     who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open
     window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be
     hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed.

     Then Jamal appears again. This time one of the children
     spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave,
     she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand
     which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle,
     Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding
     onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting.
     Salim is losing the battle and his footing. He stumbles
     and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and
     tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion.
     Interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are
     images of Jamal and Salim on top of different trains-

     - huddled together against the freezing rain...

     - surfing the wind at the front of the train...

     - admiring the distant Himalaya....

                             JAMAL V/O
               We criss-crossed the country
               from Rajasthan to Calcutta.
               Every time we were thrown off we
               got back on again. This was our
               home for years. A home with
               wheels and a whistle.

     The final tumble as they crash onto flat ground.


73   EXT. RAILWAY EMBANKMENT. DAY.                             73

     Groggily, Jamal sits up and groans. Somehow in the
     tumble, he has been transformed into a twelve year-old.
     And Salim a strong fourteen year-old. Through the haze
     of pain and dust, Jamal sees something glinting in the
     distance- something impossibly beautiful.

                             JAMAL
               Salim? Is this heaven?

                             SALIM
               You're not dead, Jamal.

     Jamal clears his head. Sees Salim picking himself up
     from the ground. But the apparition is still there.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         46.
73   CONTINUED:                                                73

                                JAMAL
                  So what's that?

                                SALIM
                  Wow.

     They stare at the apparition. The unmistakable outline
     of the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the
     morning sun. Nothing could be more beautiful.

                                JAMAL
                  Some hotel, huh?


74   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY.                                      74

     Jamal and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj
     Mahal. Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive
     monument to love. It is a moment of genuine wonderment
     for them. Then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists
     flowing behind him.

                                GUIDE
                  ...there are five main elements
                  to the Taj. The Darwaza, the
                  main gateway, the Bageecha or
                  garden, the Masjid or mosque,
                  the Naqqar Khana, the rest house
                  and the Rauza or mausoleum. If
                  you would like to follow me, I
                  will show you the ninety-nine
                  names of Allah on Mumtaz's tomb.
                  As before, please remove your
                  shoes.

     Jamal follows the Guide and his entourage into the
     mausoleum. Salim meanwhile is studying the line of
     shoes. Tries a smart pair of women's court shoes,
     before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker. A
     smile crosses his face. His other foot quickly follows
     and he saunters away, all mock-innocence.


75   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY                                       75

     Jamal comes out of the mausoleum into the bright
     sunlight and looks around for Salim. No sign of him.
     Suddenly, a German couple approach.

                                ADA
                  Please, what time is the next
                  tour?

                  Err-

                                PETER
                  - so much waiting around in this
                  damned country.

     Jamal notices that he is standing next to a sign
     advertising guided tours of the Taj.

                                JAMAL
                  No, I-

                                ADA
                  - we're on a very tight
                  schedule, you see, young man.
                  Have to see the Red Fort this
                  afternoon. Would it be possible
                  to show us around now? Obviously
                  we understand it would cost more
                  for just the two of us...

     Peter waves a couple of thousand rupee notes at Jamal.
     His eyes widen.

                                JAMAL
                  But of course, Madam. Please
                  follow me.

     Jamal stalks off. The Germans follow. Jamal stops
     before the monument. Points a confident arm at it.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  This is....the Taj Mahal.

     A terrible pause as Peter and Ada stare at him. Clearly
     more is expected. He moves off at a pace.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  The Taj Mahal was built by the
                  Emperor Khurram for his wife
                  Mumtaz who was maximum beautiful
                  woman in the whole world. When
                  she died, the Emperor decided to
                  build this five star hotel for
                  everyone who wanted to visit her
                  tomb...but he died in- in
                  fifteen eighty-seven, before any
                  of the rooms were built. Or the
                  lifts. The swimming pool,
                  however, as you can see was
                  completed on schedule in top
                  class fashion.

     He waves confidently in the direction of the fountains.

                                ADA
                  It says nothing of this in the
                  guide book.

                                JAMAL
                  With respect, Madam, the guide
                  book is written by a bunch of
                  lazy, good-for-nothing, Indian
                  beggars.

               I thought she died in child-

                    (nodding sagely)
               Exactly, Sir. She was on the way
               to the hospital when it
               happened.

     Jamal moves on. Ada and Peter exchange a glance.

     Montage of Jamal authoritatively showing tourists
     around the Taj Mahal.

               It was the best-paid job I've

               This is the Princess Diana seat,
               Madam. Allow me.

     Jamal shows the tourist a battered postcard of Princess
     Diana, staring doe-eyed into the distance with the Taj
     behind. The tourist sits. Jamal adjusts her legs so
     that they match the postcard. Takes the photo....

     Jamal stands a Tourist on a wall and positions his
     hands to create the optical illusion that he is
     dangling the Taj from his fingers. Takes a photo for
     the Tourist. Behind the Tourist, Salim and a boy called
     Shankar pick up the Tourist's shoes and saunter
     casually across the grass.

     By the side of a busy market street Salim stands next
     to a row of stolen shoes. Sneakers, court shoes,
     sandals, high heels...he is busy bartering with a man
     over a pair whilst Jamal tries to shout up business.

                                JAMAL

79   EXT. BOYS CAMP, YAMUNA RIVER. DAY.                         79

     Hectares of drying clothes by the side of the river.
     Spectacular squares of red, saffron, white. Not far
     away from the dhobi ghat, there is a makeshift slum-
     camp where Salim and a gang of children are sitting,
     smoking. Jamal joins them, hands over a wad of rupees
     to Salim. Salim counts the cash, hands half to Shankar
     and slaps Jamal so hard on the back that he nearly
     falls over.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  And life was good.


80   EXT. SLUM. DAY.                                            80

     Jamal gets out of a new Mercedes driven by an Indian
     Man. A middle-aged American couple also get out. Jamal
     points them down a lane which opens out on India's
     largest dhobi where hundreds of women are beating
     clothes on stone slabs.

                                JAMAL
                  This is the biggest dhobi ghat
                  in the whole of India, Mister

                  They say that every man in Uttar
                  Pradesh is wearing a kurta that

                  Is that so? That's amazing.
                  Let's get a look at this, Adele.

     He gets out his video camera and wanders towards the
     dhobi ghat. Behind them a motor rickshaw pulls up.
     Salim, Shankar and a couple of the street kids from the
     Taj leap out. Within seconds, the Mercedes is up on
     bricks and the wheels are being removed. Salim takes a
     hacksaw to the Mercedes badge on the bonnet, whilst
     urging the others on.

                                SALIM
                  Aré, sala! Formula One, Formula
                  One! Pit-stop ka speed,
                  Schumacher ka ishtyle

     The crowds in the lane barely notice as the car is
     stripped of all its parts.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Go, go!

     A shout from the top of the lane and the boys scatter,
     bouncing the four wheels at speed down the lane. Jamal,
     the Indian driver and the two Americans return. They
     stop in front of the denuded car.

                                CLARK
                  Woah. What happened here?

     Suddenly the Indian driver is slapping Jamal
     ferociously around the head with one of his shoes.

                                DRIVER
                  I give you two tight slaps,
                  mader chod!

                  did I...? Nothing to do with
                  me...get off!

     But the beating continues, the driver kicking Jamal
     down onto the floor. The two Americans stare, uncertain
     what to do.

                                ADELE
                  Do something, Clark.

     Jamal sits up. He is bleeding from his nose and mouth.

               You okay?

               Well, here's a bit of the real

     Adele pulls out his wallet and rummages for dollars.


81   EXT. YAMUNA RIVER. NIGHT.                                     81

     A battered Jamal limps along the river bank towards the
     Taj. He stops, bathes his swollen face in the river.
     Then looks up. Strange lights appear to emanate from
     the base of the monument. And then strange sounds.


82   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. NIGHT.                                        82

     Jamal climbs   a crumbling   wall and is confronted with an
     opera taking   place right   under the dome. Gluck's Orfeo
     ed Euridice.   Hundreds of   India's smartest professionals
     are watching   from banked   seating on a scaffolding
     frame.


83   EXT. STANDS. NIGHT.                                           83

     Jamal and a couple of street kids slip under the
     scaffolding supporting the banked seats. The street
     kids are trying to reach the hand-bags of the women
     above them.

                             BOY
                    (hissing)
               Oi, Jamal! There's a woman with
               no panties on over here.

     Jamal reaches up and easily lifts a wallet from a man's
     trouser pocket. On stage, the actors start singing.
     Jamal seems to have forgotten the wallet and stares,
     mesmerised, at the stage.

                             WOMAN
               Why don't you put it back and
               listen to the music?

     Jamal starts, makes to run, but the woman who spoke
     holds out a cigarette. A Canadian back-packer is
     sitting, staring at the singers.

                                WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  It's called Orfeo. Orpheus and
                  Eurydice. Orpheus- that one
                  there- is looking for his lover,
                  Eurydice. She died, but he can't
                  live without her.

     She hands him a cigarette. He puts the wallet back. She
     smiles at him and they both turn to the stage.

                                WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  The pain is so bad that he goes
                  to the underworld- the place we
                  go when we die- to try to get
                  her back.

                                JAMAL
                  You can't do that. Can you?

                                WOMAN

                                   WOMAN
                  Watch and see.

     Jamal watches as Orpheus sings one of the most
     beautiful pieces of music a human is likely to hear.
     Tears are running down Jamal's cheeks.


84   EXT. YAMUNA RIVER. NIGHT.                                   84

     Salim, Shankar, Jamal and the Taj Gang are gathered
     around a campfire. All of them wear extraordinary foot-
     wear of one form or another, from elaborate high heels
     to walking boots five sizes too large. A home-made
     hooka pipe is being passed around the fire. The eyes of
     the children have long since stopped focussing. Salim
     is sporting a Mercedes Benz badge on a chain around his
     neck. Behind him, Jamal appears, his face swollen. He
     takes off his fake Guide's Badge and throws it in the
     fire.

                                SALIM

                  bills in your line of work,

                                JAMAL
                  The minimum tip for my services.

     Laughter from the audience.

                                PREM
                  Now I know why my cell phone
                  bill is so high...they pay the
                  chi-wallah in hundred dollar
                  bills!

                                JAMAL
                  It's C. Benjamin Franklin.

     A gasp from the audience. Prem is caught off-guard.

                                PREM
                  Woah! We haven't locked the
                  computer, man. You're going to
                  play?

                                JAMAL
                  I think I just have. Haven't I?

                                PREM
                  You certainly have. C. Right?

                                JAMAL
                  Right. C.

                                PREM
                  Not confusing your Franklins?
                  Benjamin for Roosevelt?

                                JAMAL
                  I've never heard of Roosevelt
                  Franklin.

                                PREM
                  There's a million rupees at
                  stake and he's never heard of
                  Roosevelt Franklin...I can't
                  bear to look.

     He gives this one to the audience who titter on cue.
     Jamal looks confused.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  No, no. Don't you worry, Jamal.
                  You were asked which statesman
                  is depicted on a hundred dollar
                  bill. You said C. Benjamin
                  Franklin. Ladies and
                  Gentlemen...

     He presses the computer, pretends to ruminate for a
     while with his finger pressed to his lips.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Jamal Malik- you chose to play
                  not pay. I'm afraid you no
                  longer have two hundred and
                  fifty thousand rupees....

     Prem leans over and tears up the cheque. There is a
     sigh of disappointment from the audience, a look of
     confusion on Jamal's face.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               ...you in fact have one million
               rupees!

     Wild applause from the audience. Jamal allows himself a
     genuine smile.


88   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               88

     The Inspector pulls out a note from his wallet. Glances
     at it.

                             INSPECTOR
               Who's on the thousand rupee
               note?

                               JAMAL
               I don't know.

     He waves the note at him.

                               INSPECTOR
               It's Gandhi!

                             JAMAL
               I've heard of him.

     The Inspector kicks his chair.

                             INSPECTOR
               Don't get clever or I'll get the
               electricity out again.

                             JAMAL
               They didn't ask me that
               question. I don't know why. Ask
               them.

     The Inspector stares hard at Jamal.

                             INSPECTOR
               Funny, you don't seem that
               interested in money.

     Then, Constable Srinivas stomps back into the office,
     sweat pouring from him.

89   EXT. BOMBAY. DAY.                                           89

     From a thousand feet in the sky, looking down on the
     limitless megatropolis of Mumbai. Half-built sky-
     scrapers, slums, factories, roads, trains.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  Bombay had turned into Mumbai.

     We descend, down until the lines of ants become people.

                                JAMAL V/O (CONT'D)
                  The orphanage had gone, the slum
                  had gone, the people.... all
                  gone. And everywhere was
                  building, building, building.

     Descending even further, we pick out a construction
     site and then Jamal....


90   EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE. DAY.                                90

     ..who is staring through a wire fence at the
     construction site.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  But I knew she was here.
                  Somewhere she was here.

     He turns away, then something catches his eye.
     Underneath all the scraps of flyers and posters on a
     broken wall is a corner of something that Jamal
     recognises. He tears back a poster. Underneath, faded
     but recognisable is one of their beanbag graffiti
     advertisements.


91   EXT. SLUM. NIGHT.                                           91

     Jamal asks a group of stall-holders on the slum main
     street. They shrug, aren't interested. The camera pulls
     up and up until Jamal is nothing but a dot wandering
     the maze of lanes, railways and highways, one among
     endless millions of people.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  Evenings, I searched. Days, I
                  worked.

                                                           58.


92   EXT. HOTEL. DAY.                                            92

     Jamal wanders up to the rickshaw drivers parked outside
     the hotel. He stops and asks a question. The drivers
     shake their heads. Jamal continues up the steps towards
     a door, exhausted face and grubby clothes walking
     straight towards camera. He goes through the door and
     immediately....


93   INT. HOTEL. FOYER. DAY.                                     93

     ....is, without breaking step in a slightly grubby
     white uniform. He walks across the echoing, marble
     floor of a struggling four-star hotel, goes through
     double doors....


94   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.                                   94

     ...into a corridor that is devoid of carpet, paint-
     anything except a phone on the bare wall and a stool.
     The phone is ringing. Jamal sits on the stool and
     answers the phone.

                             JAMAL
               Room service, good afternoon?...
               Yes, sir. Two chicken burgers,
               two fries, one cocoa-cola and
               one mango lassi and a large
               bottle of mineral
               water...Bisleri or Himalayan
               Spring, Sir?...Certainly, Sir.
               That will be with you in fifteen
               minutes, Sir. Thank you. Have a
               nice day.

     He hangs up and goes through another set of doors...


95   INT. HOTEL KITCHENS. DAY.                                   95

     ...to a cramped kitchen with definite hygiene problems.
     The cooks are playing carom on the table while under it
     Salim is dozing.

                             JAMAL
               Two chicken burgers, coke, mango
               lassi and a bottle of Bisleri.

     Dozily, Salim gets up and takes a look behind one of
     the fridges. He chases out a chicken with a desultory
     kick and sorts through some empty mineral water bottles
     until he finds a Bisleri bottle. Salim fills the bottle
     of mineral water from the tap and begins delicately re-
     sealing the tamper-proof lid with super-glue. Jamal
     collects cutlery and starts laying out a tray.

                  I'm going to Chowpatti again,
                  okay? Want to come?

                                SALIM
                  For God's sake. You got some
                  disease? You force me back to
                  this shit-hole, we leave our
                  friends, a good life, loads of
                  money- for this. Isn't that
                  enough?

                                JAMAL
                  We came back to find her.

                                SALIM
                  No, you did, Jamal, not me. Me,
                  I don't give a shit about her.
                  Plenty of pussy in Bombay for
                  Salim. Oh, yes, sir! You should
                  come down the Cages on Saturday
                  night instead of searching for
                  your lost love.

                                JAMAL
                  I'm going to Chowpatti.

                                 SALIM
                       (impersonating Ram)
                  "I'm going to Chowpatti". There
                  are nineteen million people in
                  this city, Jamal. Forget her.
                  She's history.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  But she wasn't.


96   EXT. BANDRA BANDSTAND. DAY.                               96

     Jamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction. He
     moves around the beggars who are working the cars. Then
     he hears singing. He looks around, suddenly panicked.
     It is a siren song drawing him across the road, not
     even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple
     of cars, to a traffic island underneath a flyover. He
     turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up
     against one of the struts of the flyover. Arvind. Older
     now, just like Jamal, a fourteen year-old boy. But eye-
     less. Jamal freezes. He approaches Arvind and waits
     until he has finished singing. Despite his eyeless
     sockets, Arvind appears to know somebody is there. He
     turns and bows low, putting his hands together.

                                ARVIND
                  Namaste, Sahib. Any kindness you
                  give will be repaid in heaven
                  many times.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           60.
96   CONTINUED:                                                  96

     Jamal gets a couple of notes out of his pocket and puts
     them into Arvind's outstretched hand. He feels the
     notes with his fingers.

                                ARVIND (CONT'D)
                  A fifty. And a hundred!
                  Blessings upon you, Sahib.

                                JAMAL
                  How do you know?

                                ARVIND
                  There are many ways of seeing.

     Arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again.
     Then, Jamal takes his shoe off and gets out a hundred
     dollar bill.

                                 JAMAL
                  Here.

     Jamal crouches down and puts the bill into Arvind's
     hand. His fingers feel it. He sniffs it.

                                ARVIND
                  Dollars. But how many?

                                 JAMAL
                  One hundred.

                                ARVIND
                  Now you are playing with me,
                  Sahib.

                                 JAMAL
                  No. I swear.

                                ARVIND
                  What is on it? The pictures.
                  Tell me.

                                JAMAL
                  A building. With a clock on it.
                  Trees behind it.

                                ARVIND
                  The other side. Turn it over.

                                JAMAL
                  A man- it doesn't say his name.
                  He is sort of bald, but has long
                  hair on the sides.

                                ARVIND
                       (smiling)
                  Benjamin Franklin. My God, my
                  God. Thank you, Sahib. You were
                  generous the first time. But
                  this...

               And without even a song?

     A long pause. Arvind keeps hold of Jamal's arm.

                             ARVIND (CONT'D)
               So you are rich, now, are you,
               Jamal? I am happy for you.

                             JAMAL
               I am so sorry, Arvind.

                             ARVIND
               You got away. I didn't. That is
               all. No, no tears. Tears mock me
               all the more.

                             JAMAL
               Arvind, I am looking for-

                             ARVIND
               - how's your voice, Jamal?

                             JAMAL
               I don't know. I haven't sung
               since- since then. Arvind, I-

                             ARVIND
               - and your eyes?

                             JAMAL
                    (surprised)
               My eyes? My eyes are fine.

                             ARVIND
               Then stay away, chutiyé, and
               count your blessings every
               morning you open them and see
               the sun rising. You owe Maman.
               He doesn't forget.

                               JAMAL
               I owe Latika.

     Arvind shakes his head angrily.

                             JAMAL (CONT'D)
               Please. Is she alive? Arvind, is
               she alive?

                             ARVIND
               Alive? Oh, she's alive alright.
               It's your life, Jamal. Pila
               Street. They call her Cherry,
               now.

                                JAMAL
               Thank you.

     Jamal heads off through the traffic. Arvind shouts
     after him.

                             ARVIND
               I will sing at your funeral,
               yaar.


97   EXT. PILA STREET. NIGHT.                                    97

     Dark, crowded streets. Gangs of women stand outside the
     doorways or lean out of upstairs windows. They are
     garishly-dressed prostitutes varying in age from 13 to
     60. Men wander past, eying the possibilities,
     exchanging lewd comments with them. Among the hordes on
     the pavement are Jamal and Salim. They pass doorway
     after doorway of narrow rooms where prostitutes wait
     for customers. Jamal and Salim stop at each group of
     women, Salim taking the lead, clearly asking them
     something, as the women either shrug or offer them
     something lewd- judging by the laughter that follows.
     But one woman in a narrow doorway points down the
     street. Jamal has to drag a reluctant Salim away from
     the group.


98   INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.                                        98

     They go into one of the tiny houses. Loud Filmi music
     comes from upstairs. They are confronted by a woman in
     her fifties watching tv. She is less than interested.

                             SALIM
               I'm looking for Cherry.

                             WOMAN
               No, kid. Not available. Plenty
               of others. Take a look.

     She indicates curtained cubicles behind him.

                             SALIM
               I'm Latika's brother.

     The Woman looks at him properly for the first time.

                             WOMAN
               She's still not on the menu.
               Choose someone else or piss off.

     Then, Jamal pulls out some rupee notes.

                             JAMAL
               Just two minutes to talk to her.

     She takes the money, counts it.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              63.

                                  WOMAN
                   Two minutes.

      She nods upwards. Salim and Jamal head up the dark,
      tiny staircase. The Woman picks up the phone on her
      desk.


99    INT. LANDING. NIGHT.                                          99

      On the tiny landing, Salim and Jamal pull back a
      curtain to reveal a humping couple. They move on, past
      more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex,
      not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. They
      reach the end of the landing. From the other side of
      the door comes the filmi music. Jamal puts his eye to
      one of the gaps in the slatted door. Through it he can
      see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. Latika;
      though not the rag-picker of before. Now fifteen, she
      is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing,
      turquoise, silk sari.

                                 SALIM
                   Is it her or not?

      He shoves Jamal out of the way and watches.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Shit, she's sexy, man....

      Then the music stops, an effeminate man steps into the
      limited frame Salim can see and snaps a stick down hard
      on Latika's hand.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   Smile! Flow, flow! You entice
                   with the hands not make
                   chapattis, you gawaar. Again.

      The man starts the music again and Latika's hands flow
      elegantly around her head.

                                 DANCE TEACHER (CONT'D)
                   Lift your feet, you lump. Stop,
                   stop!

      The stick is raised to hit her but Jamal opens the
      door.


100   INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.                                          100

      She can barely believe her eyes.

                                  LATIKA
                   Jamal?

      The Dance Teacher turns.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                          64.
100   CONTINUED:                                             100

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   What the hell do you want?

      He switches off the music.

                                   JAMAL
                   Come. Quick.

      But Latika remains fixed.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   You silly little boys. Get out
                   now while you can.

                                   JAMAL
                   Come with us.

      Latika runs to Jamal. But she freezes as she looks at
      the doorway. Maman, Punnoose and the Woman from
      downstairs stand there. The skin around Punnoose's eye
      bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago.

                                 MAMAN
                   Look who we have here, Punnoose.
                   Hello again, Jamal. Salim. Never
                   forget a face. Especially one
                   that I own.

                                 PUNNOOSE
                   Shall I take them to the
                   marshes?

                                 MAMAN
                   Whatever you like. Have fun.
                   Just make sure that you dispose
                   of them properly afterwards. No
                   traces, thank you.

      He turns to Jamal.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   You really thought you could
                   just walk in and take my prize
                   away? Have you any idea how much
                   this little virgin is worth,
                   bhen chod?

      He fingers Latika's hair.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   Get them out of here.

      Punnoose and the Muscle walk towards Jamal. Maman turns
      to the Dance Teacher as they grab his arms.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   Please continue, Master-ji.

      The Dance Teacher puts the music back on.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

100   CONTINUED: (2)                                         100

                                SALIM
                No.

      Suddenly, Salim is holding a pistol.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                Leave him. Get over there.

      Punnoose and the Muscle slowly release Jamal and join
      Maman.

                              MAMAN
                Let's not be foolish, Salim.
                Heavy, aren't they?

      Salim straightens up his gun arm.

                                SALIM
                Money.

                              MAMAN
                You can have money. Here.

      Maman gets out his wallet and throws all the money in
      it on the floor.

                              MAMAN (CONT'D)
                Take it. Go. Disappear with your
                friend and we'll forget all
                about this. Okay?

      Salim collects up the money.

                              SALIM
                Maman never forgets. Isn't that
                right?

                              MAMAN
                Oh, Maman can make an exception.

      Salim walks over to the music, turns it up. Picks up a
      cushion from the bed and walks right up to Maman.

                              SALIM
                Can't take that risk, Maman.
                Sorry.

      He wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the
      trigger. Or tries to. Nothing happens. There is a
      frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot.
      Everybody watches with surreal interest as Salim
      fumbles with the pistol. Eventually he looks up,
      giggles stupidly.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                Safety catch.

      Shrugs apologetically and shoots. Nobody is more
      surprised than Maman who crumples onto the floor.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                         66.

      Latika starts desperately gathering up the notes on the
      floor, grabs Maman's wallet. Jamal just stands.

                               SALIM (CONT'D)
                 Come on.

      They run out of the room and down the stairs as Maman
      dies on the floor in front of his frozen colleagues.


101   EXT. CHOWPATTY BEACH. DUSK.                             101

      Children are splashing in the sea, flying kites,
      digging sand, laughing. Salim, Latika and Jamal are
      crouched on the shore watching the sun sink into the
      sea. Latika is going through Maman's wallet, Salim is
      fingering the pistol, admiringly. Jamal is staring out
      to sea. Each in their own world, yet sharing swigs from
      a bottle of Johnny Walker.

                               LATIKA
                 Shit, there's thousands here.

                               SALIM
                 We should be celebrating.

                               JAMAL
                 You just killed somebody.

                               SALIM
                 He was going to kill us.

                               JAMAL
                 Where did you get the gun?

                               SALIM
                 Bought it. Now, I'm going to
                 have to throw this beauty in the
                 sea.

                               LATIKA
                 You didn't need to kill him.

                                SALIM
                 What? Typical. I save your life
                 and you're on at me. All you
                 ever do is mess us up. Whenever
                 you're around-

                               JAMAL
                 - shut up, can't you? Just shut
                 up.

      Silence.

                               SALIM
                 Why can't you just be happy,
                 huh?

                    You got what you wanted, didn't
                    you? So, let's celebrate.

                                  LATIKA
                    Yeah. Let's celebrate.

       She takes a long swig from the bottle.

                                    LATIKA (CONT'D)
                    While we can.

       She nudges Jamal and holds the bottle out to him.
       Smiles at him. He smiles back, shakes the black dog
       from his head and takes a long, long drink. Latika and
       Salim cheer.


101A   EXT. TULIP STAR. NIGHT.                              101A

       Latika, Salim and Jamal bend back a bit of the wire
       mesh fence that protects the deserted hotel. Crawl in.


102    INT. TULIP STAR. LOBBY. NIGHT.                           102

       A very wobbly Latika, Salim and Jamal walk up the
       frozen escalators of the empty hotel, lit only by
       security lights. Kick through the odd pile of rubbish
       and stacked-up chairs. Go to the dusty reception desk.

                                    JAMAL
                    Service!

                                    SALIM
                    Reception!

                                  JAMAL
                    We want a room, boy. Executive
                    Class with smoking. Third floor
                    with balcony.

                                  LATIKA
                    Sea-facing, yaar.

                                  SALIM
                    Have the bags brought up.

       And they scoot off, giggling into the dark.


102A   INT. TULIP STAR. KITCHENS. NIGHT.                    102A

       Jamal and Latika wander the vast, empty kitchens. Jamal
       searches the empty chillers and cabinets. Then,
       realises that he is alone.

                                     JAMAL
                    Latika? Salim?

       Where are they? Suddenly,

                                     LATIKA
                    Room service!

       She comes shooting out of the darkness across the
       kitchen floor riding a trolley with Salim pushing her
       at top speed. Jamal has to skid out of the way. He
       grabs another trolley and glides off in pursuit.


102B   INT. TULIP STAR. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                       102B

       The three stand by a mirror and play with their
       reflections.


102C   INT. TULIP STAR. HOTEL LOBBY. LATER.                    102C

       On top of the metal preparation counters, Salim and
       Jamal are fencing: Jamal with a fish slice and Salim
       with a large spoon.


103    INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.                                  103

       An empty, dusty hotel suite. Jamal is on the phone.

                                  JAMAL
                    307 here. I want a bottle of
                    Johnny Walker Red Label, beer,
                    wine-

                                     LATIKA
                    - chicken.

                                  JAMAL
                    Ah! Chicken....

       Jamal closes his eyes at the wonderful thought.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    What kind of chicken?

                                  LATIKA
                         (also dreaming)
                    Tikka Masala. With roti-

                                  SALIM
                    Naan, chutney, dal-

                                  LATIKA
                    - aloo gobi, rice-

       She stops. Change of mind.

                   Pop Tarts!

                                 JAMAL
                   Hold the line, chutiye.
                   Pop Tarts?

                                 LATIKA
                   On the tv. The commercial.
                   Everybody's happy when they have
                   Pop Tarts.

                                 JAMAL
                   Exactly! A bucket of Pop Tarts,
                   chutiye.

      Jamal slams down the phone.


104   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                  104

      Latika is clearly in the shower. Jamal wanders in
      carrying an old pair of lunghi. Shouts through the
      door.

                                 JAMAL
                   Found some lunghi!

                                 LATIKA V/O
                   Stay there. Look away.

      The shower stops.

                                    JAMAL
                   Atcha, atcha.

                                 LATIKA V/O
                   I'll know if you're looking....

                                    JAMAL
                   I'm not!

      With a towel around her, Latika comes to the doorway
      where Jamal is holding out a the lunghi with his eyes
      tight shut.

                                    JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Where's Salim?

                                    LATIKA
                   Dunno.

      She watches this innocent a second with true fondness.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   You're a sweet boy, Jamal.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         70.
104   CONTINUED:                                            104

      She takes the lunghi from his outstretched hand and
      disappears into the bathroom, slamming the door with a
      giggle.


105   EXT. MUMBAI SLUM STREET. NIGHT.                          105

      Salim wanders the crowded streets of a slum. He stops
      uncertainly at a doorway where a group of men are
      lolling, smoking. Plucks up his courage.

                                 SALIM
                   I'm looking for Javed-bhai.

                                 MAN
                   Ja, mada chod. He's not looking
                   for you. Ja!

                                 SALIM
                   I need to see him.

      The group of men stir, irritated now. Salim begins to
      back away, then stops. Pulls the gun from behind his
      back.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   I killed Maman. I'll kill you
                   too. Easy.

      The group are frozen.

                                 JAVED
                   You killed him?

      Javed is standing in the doorway.

                                 JAVED (CONT'D)
                   My enemy's enemy is my friend,
                   no? So, come in, friend.


106   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                  106

      Jamal and Latika lie on the bed, drunk, though still
      coherent. Latika is dressed in the Bell-Boy's jacket
      and the old lunghi.

                                 LATIKA
                   Maman's gang will hunt us. You
                   know that?

                                   JAMAL
                   I don't care.

                                   LATIKA
                   Me neither.

      They burst into stupid laughter. The laughter subsides.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           71.
106   CONTINUED:                                              106

                                 JAMAL
                   That dance you were doing. In
                   Pila Street. Show me.

      Latika rolls over and switches off the light. Rolls
      back. In the half light, her hands begin to move for
      Jamal, the elegant, alluring hand movements of the bar-
      girl dancers. Jamal stares, mesmerised.

                                 LATIKA
                   You came back for me.

                                   JAMAL
                   Of course.

                                 LATIKA
                   I thought you'd forgotten.

                                 AMIR
                   I never forgot. Not for one day.
                   I knew I'd find you in the end.
                   It's our destiny.

                                   LATIKA
                   Destiny. Yes.

      Latika stops her hands. They stare at each other, their
      faces inches away from each other. Latika strokes
      Jamal's face.

                                   LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   Thank you.

      And face to face, they slowly fall asleep.


107   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                 107

                                   SALIM
                   Hey.

      Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,
      swaying with alcohol.

                                   JAMAL
                   Salim?

      He puts his hand out to Latika.

                                   SALIM
                   Come.

                                 JAMAL
                   No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a
                   lot to drink...

      Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his
      throat and pushes him down on the bed.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          72.
107   CONTINUED:                                             107

                                 SALIM
                   I am the elder. And I am the
                   boss. For once, you do as I say.

                                    JAMAL
                   No.

      Salim pulls Latika to her feet.

                                 SALIM
                   I saved your bloody life, didn't
                   I?

                                    LATIKA
                   Salim, please-

                                    SALIM
                   - chup, sali.

      As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps
      on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of
      course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches
      herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost
      delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the
      door, laughing.


108   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                            108

      Salim throws him out into the corridor, slams the door.

                                 SALIM
                   I am Number One now!

                                 JAMAL
                   Salim, no, no....!

                                 SALIM
                   Get yourself a room, bhai.

      Salim slams the door. Jamal gets up, bangs on the door,
      keeps on banging until the door opens and Salim stands
      there with the pistol pointing straight at Jamal's
      head.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   The man with the Colt 45 says
                   chup.

      He shoves Jamal hard down the corridor, the gun pointed
      at him all the while.

                                    JAMAL
                   Salim...

      Salim nods towards the fire escape door.

                   Now go. Or Gunmaster G-9 will
                   shoot you right between the
                   eyes. Boom. Don't think he
                   won't. You have five seconds.
                   One, two, three, four-

      Salim cocks the pistol. Jamal screws up his eyes for
      the inevitable. But Salim shoves him out with a roar
      and slams the door. Jamal bangs on the door.

                                 JAMAL O/S
                   Salim...

      Salim walks slowly back down the corridor as Jamal
      bangs and bangs on the door. Down the hall, Salim's
      door shuts.


109   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                            109

      The Inspector is staring hard at Jamal. Srinivas is
      desperately trying to get his attention.

                                 CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                   Sir, sir!

                                 INSPECTOR
                        (eventually)
                   Enlighten us Constable.

                                 CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                   Accessory to murder, Sir.

      The Inspector puts his hands in the air, palms up.
      Simple.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Only the finest minds in the
                   Mumbai Police Force.

      Untroubled by irony, Srinivas looks extremely pleased.

                                 INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                   Go check the files, Constable.

      Srinivas goes out.

                                 INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                   You puzzle me, Slumdog.
                   Admitting murder to avoid a
                   charge of fraud is not exactly
                   clever thinking. Now, why would
                   you do that?

      Jamal shrugs.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         74.

                   When somebody asks me a
                   question, I tell them the
                   answer.


110   EXT. TULIP STAR. MORNING.                                110

      At the gate, a Security Guard is sitting in his chair.

                                 JAMAL
                   Where are they?

      The Guard grunts.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Where did they go?

      A more impatient grunt from the Guard. He stands up,
      walks towards Jamal.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Please, Sir. Which way?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                   I don't know and I don't care.

      The Guard raises his stick and gives him a roar. Jamal
      backs away onto the street. The Guard slams the gate
      shut. Jamal looks despairingly up and down the street
      at the teeming traffic, the crowds.

                                 PREM V/O
                   Ready for another question.

                                 JAMAL V/O
                   Yes. I'm ready.

112   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      112

      We are back in the Studio.

                                 PREM
                   For two and a half million
                   rupees. Ladies and Gentlemen.
                   Cambridge Circus is in which UK
                   City. Is it A) Oxford, B) Leeds,
                   C) Cambridge, D) London.

      Jamal smiles.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   He's smiling. Why does that
                   worry me?

                                                         75.


113   EXT. MUMBAI. DAY.                                        113

      Leaden skies. Torrential rain is hammering on the tin
      roofs of the slum.


114   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         114

      Eighteen year-old Jamal's eyes open. Now with the
      beginnings of a beard and moustache, Jamal wakes in a
      tiny shack just big enough for a mattress on the floor.
      He pulls on a shirt, lifts the mattress and takes out
      his trousers which have been pressing there all night,
      puts them over his shoulder, picks up his shoes and
      goes down a ladder.


115   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         115

      He descends into a room and two feet of water that is
      eddying around the ground floor of the shack. Wades out
      of the door into the narrow lane of the slum.


116   EXT. SLUM. DAY.                                          116

      Jamal nods hello to a number of neighbours, also bare-
      legged, also with their shoes in hand. Together, they
      wade to higher ground, put on their trousers and shoes
      and trudge up to the main road.


117   INT. CALL CENTRE. NIGHT.                                 117

      Ultra-modern, glass-windowed office. The words Cultural
      Studies are written on the white board. Jamal walks in
      with a tray of glasses of chi. He puts a glass down on
      the young, hip, Teacher's desk and heads out again.

                              TEACHER
                Okay, guys, it's been a big week
                in UK. Kat is back.

      He holds up a copy of Radio Times showing Kat from East
      Enders smiling at them. A collective groan from the
      Trainees.

                              BARDI
                She's already back.

                                 TEACHER
                Bardi...Jamal?

                              JAMAL
                Oh. Well. She did come back,
                then she went away when Alfie
                split up with her and now she's
                back again.
                              (MORE)

117   CONTINUED:                                             117
                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   But it looks as if Alfie still
                   fancies Mo after all, so-

                                 TEACHER
                   - thank you, Jamal. Keep up,
                   Bardi. The chi-wallah knows more
                   than you.

      Bardi glares at Jamal. Jamal shrugs apologetically and
      goes out.

                                 TEACHER (CONT'D)
                   Okay, it's been super-duper hot
                   for UK this week, so there'll be
                   a lot of chat about that- they
                   love their weather- and there's
                   the festival in Edinburgh-
                   Edinburgh?

      He points at a young woman Trainee.

                                 NASREEN
                   Scotland. Kilts, castles, err,
                   haggis? Porridge, the Highlands,
                   mountains. Ben- Ben Nevis?

      The Teacher points at another Trainee.

                                 TRAINEE 2
                   Detective Taggart. Whisky, Sean
                   Connery!

                                 TEACHER
                   And lochs. Their word for lakes.
                   Good. It's also double bonus
                   time for an upgrade to the
                   `friends and family' package
                   this week, so remember to push
                   for an upgrade...

                                    EVERYONE
                   ...Every Call!

      Jamal walks out, turns a corner.


118   INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.                       118

      We are confronted with a room you could swing a Boeing
      in. Rows and rows of Operators in tiny booths stretch
      into the distance. On the walls are pictures of London,
      Tony Blair, red telephone boxes, the Yorkshire Dales,
      the Highlands- a snapshot of tourist Britain. Huge
      posters of soap stars and celebrities adorn the rest of
      the walls. Slogans hang from the ceiling. "When the sun
      comes up, you'd better be running", "you snooze, you
      lose", "Upgrade for a better, faster life." "Every call
      is a new opportunity".

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          77.
118   CONTINUED:                                             118

      Each section of the room has a banner with a British
      city's name on it and various mock sign-posts for the
      different aisles. A Manager under the banner
      "Bradford", is standing over an Operator, listening in
      on a call. The Manager leans over and presses a key.

                                 MANAGER
                   If they want an upgrade, a new
                   tariff or we're stealing them
                   from the other networks, you
                   take the call. Anything else-

      He mimes cutting his throat.

                                 MANAGER (CONT'D)
                   No time-wasters on Team
                   Bradford, kid. Leave that to the
                   homosexuals on Tunbridge Wells.

      Jamal stops by him. The Manager takes a glass of tea
      from Jamal.

                                 MANAGER (CONT'D)
                   Where've you been? Dave on
                   Cornmarket's virtually lost his
                   voice, there's two on Ilkley
                   Moor who've had their hands up
                   for hours. Come on, move it!

      Jamal hurries down the aisle signposted "Cornmarket",
      gets to a male trainee and hands him a tea. Dave
      glances around to check nobody's looking and slips off
      his head-set.

                                 DAVE
                   Two minutes, Jamal. I'm on
                   "Millionaire" duty.

                                  JAMAL
                   Rajneesh...

                                 DAVE
                   It's my turn, Jamal. I've had my
                   pee breaks. Please. If he comes
                   just keep your head down and
                   pretend you're doing an upgrade
                   on the-

                                 JAMAL
                   - `friends and family'. I know.

      Jamal still looks unwilling.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Two minutes.

118   CONTINUED: (2)                                        118

      Dave heads off towards a Rest and Recreation room,
      where a big plasma screen on the wall is showing "Who
      Wants To Be A Millionaire."Jamal grabs the jacket from
      the back of Dave's chair, puts the head-set on and
      hunches over the booth, just another Operative at work.
      We become aware that every operator down the Cornmarket
      aisle- and quite a few other aisles besides- is staring
      in the direction of the Rest and Recreation Room.


119   INT. REST AND RECREATION ROOM. NIGHT.                 119

      Dave is watching the screen.

                              PREM
                ...if you want a chance to be a
                contestant on Who Wants To Be A
                Millionaire, dial the number
                now.

      Dave dives for the doorway and waves.


120   INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.                    120

      Suddenly all the operators are dialling. Almost
      simultaneously, twenty or so voices say.

                              OPERATORS
                I'd like to be a contestant on
                Who Wants to be a Millionaire.

      Most of the Operators- including the man next to Jamal-
      suddenly lose their tension.

                              OPERATOR
                Bloody bastard. I never get it.

                              JAMAL
                You have to dial when Prem says
                "if". "If you want the chance to
                be a contestant on Who Wants To
                Be A Millionaire..." That's when
                they open the lines.

      The Operator looks at him. Jamal shrugs.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                That's what Anjum in Technical
                says. He put the system in.

                              OPERATOR
                So why don't you?

                              WOMAN V/O
                Hello? Hello? Have I been
                transferred again, for God's
                sake?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                          79.
120   CONTINUED:                                             120

      Jamal freezes with fear. The head-set speaks again with
      its broad Scottish accent.

                                 WOMAN V/O (CONT'D)
                   Hello? Jesus, God, will somebody
                   talk to me?

                                   JAMAL
                   Hello, Mrs...

      He stares at the computer.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   ...Mackintosh from King Gussie.

                   It's Kingussie, love. Pronounced

                                 WOMAN V/O
                   So where are you from? Abroad, I
                   bet. China or somewhere. What
                   good is-

                                 JAMAL
                   - just down the road from your
                   house, Mrs Mackintosh. Next to
                   the loch.

                                 WOMAN V/O
                        (suspicious)
                   Oh aye? Which loch?

      Jamal searches desperately around, spots a picture of
      Big Ben.

                                 JAMAL
                   Loch Big- Loch Ben. Next door to
                   Detective Taggart's flat.

                                 WOMAN V/O
                   Loch Ben? Och, no, hen, that's
                   one of the wee ones up in the
                   Highlands. You're all the way up
                   there? But I bet it rains, eh,
                   hen?

                                 JAMAL
                   Indeed yes, Mrs Mackintosh. I
                   have to wade through a metre of
                   water every morning.

                                   WOMAN V/O
                   No!

                Yes, yes, Mrs Mackintosh. In my
                kilt.

                                WOMAN V/O
                Och, no, hen.

      Jamal puts his feet on the desk.

                              JAMAL
                It's alright once I've had my
                porridge, my haggis and a few
                Scotch whiskies- and the
                monsoon's nearly over, so-

                              WOMAN V/O
                - and what monsoon would that
                be? I'd like to speak to your
                supervisor, son.

                              JAMAL
                I don't think that's a good
                idea. He is a very important
                man, Mrs Mackintosh-

                              WOMAN V/O
                - get me the supervisor on this
                line now-

                              JAMAL
                - and he doesn't like bloody
                time wasters.

      Jamal panics, presses the button he saw the Manager
      press earlier. The screen goes blank, then reboots
      itself. Jamal looks around. Where the hell is Dave? On
      the screen, Jamal is faced with the question: "what
      name do you require?" He looks around again, and then
      with one finger types in the word "Latika". He presses
      enter. Hundred upon hundred of Latikas with their
      surnames and phone numbers scroll down the page. He
      erases her name and enters the name Salim K. Malik.
      Presses enter. Fifteen numbers come up. He stares at
      the numbers for a long time, then types it into his
      computer and presses dial.

                                MAN V/O
                Yeah?

                                JAMAL
                Salim?

                              MAN V/O

                 I am calling from XL 5

                 you were dead or something...we
                 had to go, Jamal. Maman's guys.
                 They were searching the
                 hotel...Jamal, say something.
                 Please.

      There is another long silence.

      A flash of a sign post reading `Oxford Circus',
      pointing down one of the aisles. The banner above that
      section of the warehouse reads `London'.

                                                      CUT TO:

      Jamal hurrying down another `Kings Parade' carrying
      glasses of tea. He glances up to see a large banner
      that says `Cambridge'.

      Jamal comes back up an aisle named `Broad Street'. An
      Operator on the adjacent `The High' clicks his fingers
      for another cup. Jamal hurries under the sign marked
      `Oxford'.

                                                      CUT TO:

      The signposts of the aisles come faster and faster

      Jamal is sweating, his face scrunched up in thought.

                                 JAMAL
                   I can't remember.

                   I don't think it's Oxford.

                                 PREM
                   Based on your extensive

                        (almost to himself)
                   Well, Oxford has Broad Street,
                   Saint Aldates, Turl Street,
                   Queen Street, The High and
                   Magdalene Bridge- which is
                   pronounced Maudlin, so-

      He stops as he hears the surprised laughter of the
      audience.

                                 PREM
                   I thought you hadn't been to UK.

                                 JAMAL
                   Oh, I haven't. And it's not
                   Leeds, because that's Elland
                   Road, Kirkgate Market,
                   Commercial Street, St Peter's-

                                 PREM
                        (icy)
                   - what might it be then, Jamal?

                                 JAMAL
                   Well, I don't think it's
                   Cambridge.

                                 PREM
                   Cambridge Circus is not in
                   Cambridge? Dare I ask why?

                                 JAMAL
                   Too obvious. There's definitely
                   an Oxford Circus in London, and
                   there's a rowing race between
                   Oxford and Cambridge so there's
                   probably a Cambridge Circus too.
                   I'll go for D) London.

                                 PREM
                   That's the logic that's got him
                   this far, Ladies and Gentlemen.
                   Who are we to argue? So. Jamal.

                For five million rupees, my

                    It was self-defence.

                   You've got a cheque for five

                   Phone A Friend and 50/50. For
                   ten million rupees: pay, play,
                   or bail out. It's still an
                   option. Remember, if you get the

      The Indian tries to halt the other batsman with a
      shout, then succumbs to the inevitable and charges down
      the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball at the stumps. The
      bails fly off.


130   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                     130

                                 JAMAL
                   I'll play.

      Tense laughter from the audience. Prem holds up the
      cheque. Jamal nods. Prem tears it up slowly. Allows the
      pieces to fall to the floor.

                                 PREM
                   The dreams of so many. On the
                   floor.


131   EXT. TOWER BLOCK. DAY.                                  131

      Jamal is riding the construction lift to the top of a
      high building, still just a shell but buzzing with
      carpenters, bricklayers, cable-layers. The lift stops
      at the top. Jamal gets out. Looks around. He is miles
      up. Alone.

                                 SALIM
                   Jamal!

      Jamal looks around. There is Salim standing on the edge
      of the building. He saunters over to Jamal, his arms
      outstretched in theatrical greeting. He is groomed,
      expensively dressed with the best mobile money can buy
      dangling from a gold chain around his neck.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   God is good, bhai. God is good.

      He tries to embrace Jamal. With as much force as he can
      muster, Jamal punches him in the face. Salim takes it.
      Stands there. Wipes blood from his lip. Gets another
      punch. Then another and another, not even defending
      himself, until he is being beaten back by a raging
      Jamal towards the edge of the building. Finally, he
      tries to reason with Jamal

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Maman's boys were after us. Had
                   to skip.

      Jamal keeps on beating him back.

                                 JAMAL
                   Liar.

                                  SALIM
                    Left a message at reception.
                    Waited weeks for you in Nagpur.

                                  JAMAL
                    There was no message at
                    reception.

                                  SALIM
                    Bhai, I left a message.

       Salim opens his arms, defenceless. It would take one,
       small push to send him over the edge. There is a
       moment, when Jamal might. He even has his hands on his
       chest.

                                  JAMAL
                    I will never forgive you.

                                  SALIM
                    I know.

       The fury in Jamal subsides minutely. Finally, he turns
       away with a roar of frustration. Salim hangs his head.


131A   EXT. TOWER BLOCK. LATER.                              131A

       Jamal and Salim are sitting on the very edge of the
       building. They can see for miles across the city. Salim
       has rediscovered his attitude.

                                  SALIM
                    Can you believe it? This was our
                    slum. We lived just there, huh?
                    Now it is business, apartments,
                    call centres...Fuck USA, fuck
                    China. India is at the centre of
                    the world, now, bhai. And I am
                    at the centre of the centre,
                    Jamal. This is all Javed-bhai's.

                                  JAMAL
                    Javed Mehta? The Gangster from
                    our slum? You work for him?

                                  SALIM
                    Who else would protect us from
                    Maman's gang, huh?

                                  JAMAL
                    What do you do for him?

                                  SALIM
                    Anything he asks.

       Salim's mobile rings. Salim is immediately subservient
       on the phone. Rings off.

                    He is coming. You must go. My
                    card.

       He hands Jamal a card.

                                  JAMAL
                    What for?

                                  SALIM
                    You think I am going to let you
                    out of my sight again, little
                    brother? You stay with me now.
                    Ab phut!

                                  JAMAL
                    Salim, where's Latika?

                                  SALIM
                    Still? She's gone, Jamal. Long
                    gone. Now go. Quick.

       Jamal gets up, hurries away, hidden behind piles of
       building materials just as Javed appears in his flash
       suit and jewelry. Three of his young henchmen walk
       alongside.



132    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT.    NIGHT.                        132

       Jamal is asleep on a mattress on the floor of a smart
       apartment. A mobile phone rings. The muffled sound of
       Salim talking quietly next door. Then, Salim creeps
       into the room, checks to see Jamal is asleep, unlocks a
       desk drawer and brings out his pistol. He puts it in a
       hold-all and goes out the front door. Jamal's eyes snap
       open. He has seen it all.

                                  JAMAL V/O
                    Slum dogs never sleep, only nap.
                    He would disappear for a couple
                    of days and come back changed.
                    Sometimes elated-


133    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           133

       The door bangs open and a giggling-drunk, half-naked
       Bar Girl drags the sleeping Jamal up and into the
       bathroom.

                                  BAR GIRL
                    He has flipped! I can't do
                    anything with him....

       Salim is in the bath, bathing, literally, in money.

                                 JAMAL V/O
                   Sometimes the opposite.

      Jamal creeps towards Salim's bedroom door. He pushes it
      open a fraction to see Salim crouched on the floor in
      prayer, sobbing quietly.

                                 SALIM
                        (whispering)

                   But younger brothers don't
                   interfere. Mostly.


135   EXT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. DAY.                             135

      Salim comes out of his apartment block. Gets into his
      jeep. Drives off. Doesn't notice Jamal in the motor
      rickshaw that pulls out and follows him.


136   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              136

      Salim approaches a gate-house to a large bungalow. The
      Door-Keeper nods to him, rings a bell. From the
      rickshaw, Jamal watches a woman come to the door.
      Latika. Eighteen, completely beautiful and rich. She
      hands Salim a package and goes back inside. Salim gets
      in his jeep and drives away.


137   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              137

      Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.

                                 JAMAL
                   Baba, I am the new cook from the
                   agency. A thousand apologies, I
                   am late for the Memsaab.

      The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief
      pause, he returns.

                                 DOOR-KEEPER
                   She doesn't know anything about
                   any cook. There's supposed to be
                   a dishwasher being delivered.
                   Know anything about that?

      The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.
      Latika appears at the gate.

                                 LATIKA
                   Haven't I told you, don't
                   interrupt when I'm watching-

      She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   - come inside. I'll show you the
                   kitchen.


138   INT. KITCHEN. DAY.                                       138

      Latika and Jamal go into the kitchen. Who Wants To Be A
      Millionaire plays on the tv in the background. She
      turns and hugs him tight. They laugh with happiness.

                                 LATIKA
                        (delighted)
                   Jamal, Jamal, look at you...!

      Their heads are close, they might kiss. Then Latika
      turns away, stares out of the window.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   Aré wa, Jamal....

      Jamal smiles hopefully at her. But there is sadness in
      her now. She takes her sunglasses off, rubs her eyes.
      There is a bruise there.

                                 JAMAL
                   You've hurt your eye.

                                 LATIKA
                   Why are you here?

                                 JAMAL

                                 LATIKA
                   Well. You see me.

      She stands there, challenging. On the tv, somebody is
      winning money.

                                 JAMAL

                   on the street. From where we
                   come from, Jamal, that is
                   happiness.

                   You don't look so happy with a

                   You turn up here out of nowhere,

      Voices at the gate-house.

                   Javed? You are with him?

      She throws him an apron. He gets it on just in time for
      Javed to walk in. Jamal turns away.

      Javed stares at Jamal a moment, trying to place a face
      he vaguely recognises. Then the Bookie comes on the
      line and he turns back to the television.

      Latika hurries around the kitchen getting out bread and

                Come away with me.

                what? What can you provide? What
                have you got, Jamal?

                              JAMAL
                Love.

                ..yeah. He's on eighty-five. I
                want four lakh on him making a
                century. What are you
                giving?...Okay, make it five
                lakh.

      Javed pours himself a glass of whisky, never taking his
      eyes from the television.

                We are watching history unfold
                today at the Wankhedé Stadium as
                Sachin Tendulkar carves his way
                towards another magnificent
                century and the record books.
                His thirty-eighth century- the
                most by any Indian cricketer
                ever...

                It won't buy you a new

                You and me. That is the real
                world. Come away with me.

      Latika snatches the sandwich from him and gives it to
      Javed. Goes back to Jamal, whispers under cover of
      putting condiments away.

                                LATIKA
                You're crazy.

                              JAMAL
                Salim will help us.

                Straight bat, straight bat,

      Then the batsman at the other end calls to take a
      second run.

                                JAVED (CONT'D)
                No! A single!

      Tendulkar seems to agree, tries to halt the other
      batsman with a shout, then succumbs to the inevitable
      and charges down the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball
      at the stumps. The bails fly off.

                              JAVED (CONT'D)
                No, no, no! stupid ben chod
                idiot...

      He flings his glass of whisky at the television.
      Suddenly tastes what he has been eating.

      Javed throws the sandwich at him and slams out of the
      room. His footsteps can be heard stomping into another
      room.

                              LATIKA
                Now go, before he kills us both.

      She leads Jamal to the door.

                Latika, where's my bloody shirt?
                The Armani.

      Latika shouts over her shoulder.

                              LATIKA
                Coming!

      Back to Jamal.

                     (whispered)
                You want to do something for me?

                              JAMAL
                Anything.

                              LATIKA
                Then forget me.

                              JAMAL
                I'll wait at VT station. Five
                o'clock every day until you
                come.

      She shakes her head.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                I love you.

                              LATIKA
                So what, Jamal? So what?
                (loudly)
                Now, get out and tell your no-
                good agency not to send anybody
                else until they've learnt to
                cook. You hear?

      She slams the door. Hurries back into the kitchen,
      throws Javed's plate into the sink. The Door-keeper
      comes in.

                              DOOR-KEEPER
                Madam, your dishwasher has
                arrived.

      Leaning over the sink, Latika weeps silently.

                                                         96.


139   INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           139

      Salim has his hand around Jamal's throat.

                              SALIM
                Why can't you let it alone? You
                want money, I'll give you money.
                Girls? I can get you girls.

                              JAMAL
                You know what I want.

                              SALIM
                You're like some crazy man-
                you're obsessed.

                              JAMAL
                She is my destiny, Salim.

                              SALIM
                Know what your destiny is, crazy
                boy? A bullet between the eyes.
                And after that, he'll kill her.
                Is that what you want? Huh?

                              JAMAL
                Me, I don't care. Latika? She's
                already half dead.

      Salim takes his hand away from Jamal's neck.

                              SALIM
                Yes. About that, you are right.

                                JAMAL
                You sold her.

                              SALIM
                     (fierce)
                I didn't sell her. Javed wanted
                her. He gets what he wants.

      He turns away bitterly.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                She's doing alright. Get it into
                your thick head, Jamal. She's
                not yours and she never will be.

      chair.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   You've got the luck of the

                   Oh, the toilet. Sure. Naveed,
                   Jamal wants the bog.

      The Floor Manager and a Security Guard usher Jamal off-
      stage. Prem looks up at the gallery, raises his eyes at
      the Director. Some show. Then he gathers himself and
      heads off-stage.


141   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 141

      The clock reads five oh three. Jamal stands on the
      footbridge. Humanity washes around him. His eyes dart
      around, frightened to miss her. Checks the clock again.
      Six. The platform is almost deserted. He wanders away.


142   INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                                   142

      Prem wanders down the corridor followed by a Security
      Guard. Another Security Guard is waiting at the
      entrance to the toilet. Prem goes in, leaving the two
      Guards in the corridor.


143   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 143

      Jamal stands on the footbridge gazing down at the
      hordes of commuters. Five o'clock, five fifteen, five
      thirty. Six. Jamal rests his head against the railings.


144   INT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                     144

      Jamal is in one of the cubicles. Prem goes to the
      urinal. Unzips.

       Prem finishes pissing. Goes over to the washbasins,
       runs the taps and washes his hands.

                                  JAMAL O/S
                    No, I really don't.

                    me, you're going to win.

       Prem leaves. Jamal flushes and comes out of the
       cubicle. Goes to the washbasins. In the mist on the
       mirror above the taps is written the letter "B". Jamal
       stares at it. Gradually it fades, leaving only the
       growing fury on his face staring back at him.


145    INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      145

       Jamal stalks back onto the set. Sits down in his chair.
       Stares at Prem who looks unconcernedly back.

145A   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 145A

       The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the
       descending river of people out of his way, the
       seventeen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps
       that cross the platforms. He pushes to the middle of
       the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He
       scans the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her:
       the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly
       beautiful, over the other side of the station. A world
       away. She is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

                                  JAMAL
                    Latika! Latika!

       But though he is screaming her name, his voice is
       swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two
       thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.

                    Latika!

       Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one
       figure against an army of white-robed people. He gets
       to the bottom of the steps, is making progress against
       the tide. But so are the two men. Jamal is now on the
       same platform. Shouts her name again. She turns with a
       smile. But the two Thugs leap through a train onto her
       platform. She sees them, starts running, is lost in the
       crowd. Jamal runs off along the platform after Latika.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    Latika! Latika!


       By the time Jamal has fought himself to where Latika
       was- she is gone. He whirls around, mad with
       frustration.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    Latika! Latika!

       Latika is jumping the tracks, crossing in front of
       trains. But the Thugs are gaining on her. He brings her
       down and drags her across to Javed's waiting Mercedes.
       Salim is standing by the car. Jamal pushes through the
       crowds just in time to see Salim bundling her into the
       car.

                                   JAMAL
                    Salim!

       Salim spits disgustedly on the ground. Gets in. Latika
       twists her head to see Jamal as the car skids off.
       Jamal screams with hopeless fury.

                   Welcome back to Who Wants to Be
                   A Millionaire? In the chair
                   tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we
                   don't know! In an amazing run,
                   Jamal has already five million
                   rupees but, not content with
                   that, has chosen to gamble for
                   one Crore- that's ten million
                   million rupees. What a player!
                   The question one more time:
                   Which cricketer has scored the
                   most first class centuries in
                   history. Was it A) Sachin
                   Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)
                   Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.

                                 JAMAL
                   I know it isn't Sachin
                   Tendulkar.

                                 PREM
                   That's a start. So, it could be
                   Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or
                   Michael Slater.

                                 JAMAL
                   I'll use a life-line. Fifty-
                   fifty.

                                  PREM
                   Okay. Computer, take away two
                   wrong answers.

      Music swells, lights dim.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                Well, you were right about
                Sachin Tendulkar. The computer
                has taken away A) Sachin
                Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.
                That leaves you a fifty-fifty
                choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting
                or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you
                think? Decision time. For half a
                million rupees. Your answer: B)
                Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.

      A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into
      Prem's eyes.

                                 JAMAL
                D.

      A barely perceptible jump from Prem.

                              PREM
                You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?
                The Australian? Great cricketer.

                                 JAMAL
                D. Jack Hobbs.

                                 PREM
                Do you know?

      Jamal shakes his head.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?

                              JAMAL
                Or D. Jack Hobbs.

                                 PREM
                Final Answer?

                              JAMAL
                Final Answer. D.

      A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.

                              PREM
                Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.

      Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                With one hundred and ninety-
                seven first class centuries, the
                answer is...D. Jack Hobbs!

      The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.

                Jamal Malik, Crorepati!

      The camera goes off Prem for a second. He mimes a
      disgusted spit. Then he is back on.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                I cannot believe what I am
                seeing here, tonight, Ladies and
                Gentlemen....So, are you ready
                for the final question for two
                Crore rupees- twenty million
                rupees?

                              JAMAL
                Not really, but...maybe it is
                written, no?

                              PREM
                Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For
                twenty million rupees, the final
                question on Who Wants to be a
                Millionaire?

      The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.
      Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into
      nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I
                would need a pacemaker fitted,
                we're out of time! What a show,
                Ladies and Gentlemen, what a
                show. Join us tomorrow night to
                see if Jamal Malik has made the
                biggest mistake of his life or
                has just won the biggest prize
                in the history of Indian
                television....Same place, same
                time. You wouldn't dare miss it.
                Goodnight!

      Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off
      his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up
      and pulls out his mobile.


149   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              149

      Waving a kitchen knife in on hand, a desperate Jamal
      slams through the gates of Javed's bungalow, the
      objecting Doorkeeper running along behind. He bangs
      open the front door.

                              JAMAL
                Latika!

                                                         103.


150    INT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              150

       Stops dead. The place has been stripped of everything.
       Not a single thing remains. Jamal runs into another
       room. As empty as the first. He stops in his tracks.

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 Told you.

                               JAMAL
                 Where? Where is she?

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 Dunno.

       He grabs the Door-keeper by the shirt-collar, slams him
       up against the wall. Holds the knife against his
       throat.

                               JAMAL
                 Where?

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 I don't know! Wouldn't say,
                 would they? They had to get out
                 fast. The police. Honestly.

       Jamal lets go of the Door-keeper. Goes hopelessly to
       the window. On the window sill is a phone. He picks it
       up. There is a dial tone. Jamal rummages in his trouser
       pocket. Gets out the battered card with Salim's details
       on. Dials. Salim picks up.

                               JAMAL
                 Where are you? Where is she?


150A   INT. JAVED'S SAFE HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. DAY.             150A

       Salim is stalking around his room in Javed's new house.
       Hold-alls of clothes and possessions lie around the
       room. A chest of drawers sits with its drawers open,
       still empty.

                               SALIM
                 Where you'll never find her. Or
                 me. You could have joined us,
                 you bloody idiot, been one of
                 us. You've lost everything now.
                 Everything.

       Cuts the call off and slings the phone in a drawer.
       Takes the gun from his waist, and throws that in too.
       Slams the drawer shut with as much force as he can.

                                                          104.


150B   INT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                           150B

                                 JAMAL
                 Salim...!

       The line goes dead. Jamal slides to the floor...


151    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                            151

       ...the camera pulls out from Jamal's face revealing
       that Jamal is sitting on the floor of Salim's
       apartment. In the background can be heard the sound of
       the television. Jamal looks at the knife in his hand,
       wonders what he might do with it. The sound of Prem's
       voice on the tv.

                               PREM O/S
                 ...if you want a chance to play
                 Who Wants to be a Millionaire,
                 call now...!

       Jamal looks up. Stares at the tv.


152    INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            152

                                PREM
                 This way, Jamal, this way. Great
                 show, my friend. See you
                 tomorrow, huh?

       In the half-light, Prem guides him to a stage door.


153    EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            153

       Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the
       rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is
       thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into
       the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at
       the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens
       screaming.

                               DIRECTOR
                 What's going on?

                                 PREM
                 He's a cheat.

                               DIRECTOR
                 This was you? You called them?

       Prem shrugs.

                               DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                 How d'you know he's cheating?

                                 PREM
                   Oh, come on! Of course he is.
                   He's a bloody village boy. Even
                   when I fed him the wrong answer
                   the little shit got it right.

      Director stares at him.

                                 DIRECTOR
                   You gave him an answer?

                                 PREM
                   Well, I didn't exactly-

      The Director walks away shaking his head. In the
      doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   Nita?

      But she too turns and walks away.


154   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                            154

                                 INSPECTOR
                   It is all bizarrely plausible.
                   And yet...

                                 JAMAL
                   Because I am a slum dog, chi-
                   wallah, I am a liar, right?

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Most of you are.

      Srinivas comes hurrying in carrying a file, very
      pleased with himself.

                   Shooting at Pila Street, October
                   19th...Maman Hossani....Victim
                   pronounced dead at scene.
                   Suspects absconded: two males,
                   early teens, one female, early
                   teen.

      The Inspector takes the file. Stares at it. Shakes his
      head.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   But you: you're not a liar,
                   Mister Malik, that is for sure.
                   You are too truthful.

      He turns to Srinivas.

                    Thank you, Constable. All that
                    remains is to work out whether
                    it was manslaughter or murder.
                    Ten years, or life.

       The Young Constable sticks his head around the door.

                                  YOUNG CONSTABLE
                    The Commissioner's here, Sir.

       The Inspector sighs. Gets up. Accompanied by Srinivas,
       he leaves the room. Jamal sits there. Lets his head
       drop. The camera floats from the room, down the dingy
       corridor and out through a window...

                    all of India is talking about.
                    Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated,
                    eighteen year-old boy from the
                    slums of Mumbai win one Crore
                    rupees by fair means or foul?
                    And in the crowds all around me
                    there is an even bigger
                    question. Will he be back on the
                    show tonight to play for twenty
                    million rupees...

156A   INT. POLICE OFFICE. DAY.                                  156A

       The Commissioner is waiting in the outer office.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    So? Have you charged him yet?

                                  INSPECTOR
                    I- progress is being made sir.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    Progress? Have you charged him?

                                  INSPECTOR
                    No, Sir.

156A   CONTINUED:                                                156A

       The Commissioner dumps a copy of the Times of India
       down on the desk. Then the Hindustan Times, the Amar
       Ujala and the Afternoon Dispatch thump down after them.
       All have photos of Jamal on Who Wants to be a
       Millionaire on the front page.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    And if that isn't enough for
                    you...

       He motions the Inspector to come over to the window.

       Lifts the blind. The Inspector hurries over. Looks
       alarmed.

                                   INSPECTOR
                    That's-?

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    - yes, yes! The boy's a bloody
                    hero with every beggar and thief
                    in the city. We're in danger of
                    looking very stupid, here,
                    Inspector.

                                  INSPECTOR
                    Whilst I'm not convinced he
                    actually cheated, I have got-

       The Inspector brandishes the file.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    - Prem Kumar himself- a man of
                    great standing and integrity-
                    said the kid was a liar and a
                    cheat. What more do you need?

       The Inspector pauses.

                                   INSPECTOR
                    A liar.

       Then he puts the file behind his back. Srinivas frowns.

                                   INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                    Indeed, sir.

       Srinivas coughs pointedly. Gets a steely look from the
       Inspector. The Commissioner has been staring out of the
       window at the crowds. Turns back to them.

                                  COMMISIONER OF POLICE
                    He's in for fraud, so you charge
                    him for fraud. Fast. Or you'll
                    find yourself on traffic duty at
                    the Gateway of India.
                    Understand?

                 Yes, sir.

       The Commissioner walks out.

                               CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                 Sir-?


                               INSPECTOR
                 Not a word, Srinivas.


157    INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.            157

       A cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars. Pulling
       back we see it is Latika, staring frozen at Jamal on
       the television news. A palatial living room. Dealing
       cards to Salim, is Javed Khan. A couple of Bar Girls
       giggle next to Javed and a couple of his Thugs. Pouring
       drinks at a sideboard is Latika. Javed glances up at
       the screen, clearly not recognising Jamal on a clip
       from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is
       staring, wide-eyed at the tv. Javed picks up the
       remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a
       music channel. Latika hurries out.

                               JAVED
                 What about my bloody whisky,
                 woman?

       But she has already gone. He growls after her.

                               JAVED (CONT'D)
                 Hey, Salim.

       He motions Salim to get him a drink. Javed's mobile
       rings as Salim goes over to the sideboard. Shifts a
       bottle to the back.

                               SALIM
                 We're out. I'll just get- Syed.

       Salim smiles faintly at the image of Jamal and hurries
       out.


158    INT . JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. NIGHT.           158

       A drawer opens. Inside is Salim's pistol. And a phone-
       the same one he threw in there months ago. Salim stares
       at both for a long time. Finally, picks up the gun and
       phone.

                               SALIM
                      (to himself)
                 Final answer?

       He finds this faintly amusing.

                                                        109.


159   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                 159

      Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears
      running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front
      of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away
      the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door
      behind him. Stares at the tv.

                              SALIM
                That boy. He will never give up.
                Never.

      He shakes his head.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                Crazy chutiyé.

      Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks
      towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                Ja. Go.

                                 LATIKA
                But-

                              SALIM
                - just drive. There won't be
                another chance. Go.

      Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.

                              LATIKA
                He'll kill you.

      Salim smiles, shakes his head.

                              SALIM
                It is not written.

                                 JAVED O/S
                Salim!

      Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for
      her.

                              LATIKA
                Salim, I....can't.

      Salim points at the television.

                              SALIM
                You have to. It'll take you two
                hours if you drive fast. Here.

      He holds out his mobile phone.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                For God's sake, hold on to it.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

      Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her
      head for a moment.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   For what I have done, please
                   forgive me.

      Salim releases her.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Go. Have a good life.

      Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.
      Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.


160   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                          160

      Jamal is dozing in the chair. He wakes with a shout.
      Srinivas has just thrown a bucket of water in his face.
      He unlocks the handcuffs. Jamal looks up at him.
      Srinivas shrugs.

                                 CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                   You're back on the show.

      police. Mobiles are being confiscated and put in bags.

      Gaffers make last-minute adjustments to the lights
      shining on the empty chairs in the middle of the set.
      Camera positions are checked by the Floor Manager.


163   INT. POLICE OFFICE. NIGHT.                               163

      Srinivas walks Jamal through the police office, past
      the Inspector sitting at his desk, his arms behind his
      head, pondering. He watches Jamal go and then asks:

                                 INSPECTOR OF POLICE
                   What happened? To the girl?
                   Latika?

      Jamal stops.

                                 JAMAL
                   Who knows?

      Jamal walks on. The Inspector watches him all the way.

                                                          111.


164   INT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                   164

      Jamal sits in the back of the police jeep. It pulls out
      of the police station car park into a sea of people all
      cheering and shouting at the jeep. Jamal looks
      terrified.


165   INT. CAR. NIGHT.                                           165

      Latika drives through the slums of Mumbai. She hoots
      her horn furiously at a cart-driver ambling across the
      road.


166   INT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                   166

      The jeep stops at the lights and a beggar wanders up,
      tapping on the windscreen. The beggar studies Jamal's
      face for a second, then starts shouting and pointing at
      him.

                              BEGGAR
                Crorepati! Crorepati!

      Other beggars- just like the one Jamal used to be- join
      him and start cheering and applauding. The jeep pulls
      away.

      the back and runs to the tv in the café.

      everyone crowded around the tv in the Recreation Room.
      Stalks over.

                              MANAGER
                Oi! Get back to work.

      Then he sees Jamal's face on the tv.

                   You should be.

      runs to it.

                 that tonight is the biggest
                 night of both of our lives,
                 Ladies and Gentlemen. Jamal
                 Malik, the Call Centre worker
                 from Mumbai has already won one
                 Crore rupees, a cool ten
                 million. Tonight, he can walk
                 away with that in his pocket or
                 make the biggest gamble in
                 television history and go for
                 the final question and a
                 staggering twenty million
                 rupees! Jamal, are you ready for
                 that question?

                               JAMAL
                 Yes.

       The lights dim, the music rumbles. Prem pushes the
       button on his computer. Pauses. Gets conversational.

                               PREM
                 Big reader, are you Jamal? A
                 lover of literature?

       Nervous laughter from the audience. Jamal just shrugs.

                                 JAMAL
                   I can read.

      Even more nervous laughter.

                                 PREM
                   Lucky! In Alexandre Dumas' book,
                   The Three Musketeers, two of the
                   musketeers are called Athos and
                   Porthos. What was the name of
                   the third musketeer. Was it A)
                   Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,
                   C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.

      An involuntary laugh comes out of Jamal's mouth.


178   INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                              178

      In the shack, sitting on an upturned oil drum,
      surrounded by puzzled Indians in rags, a slow smile
      comes to Latika's face.

      Camera on Prem.

                                 PREM
                   The final question, for twenty
                   million rupees: and he's
                   smiling. I guess you know the
                   answer.

                                 JAMAL
                   Would you believe it? I don't.

      Jamal laughs. There's nothing else to do. The audience
      groan.

                                 PREM
                   You don't? So, you're going to
                   take the ten million and walk?

                                 JAMAL
                   No.

                                 PREM
                   No?

                                 JAMAL
                   I'll play.

      A gasp from the audience.

                                 PREM
                   You just said you don't know the
                   answer. I heard that, right? You
                   do understand that if you get
                   the answer wrong, you lose
                   everything? Ten million rupees.
                   A fortune, Jamal.

      A terrible pause.

                                 JAMAL
                   I'd like to phone a friend.

                                  PREM
                   We're going to the wire, Ladies
                   and Gentlemen, we are going to
                   the wire. The final Life-line.
                   Here we go....


181   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      181

      Prem presses his computer. Ominous rumble of drums. The
      lights dim. A phone can be heard ringing, the amplified
      sound echoing around the studio.

                                   PREM
                   It's ringing.

      The phone continues to ring.


182   INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                              182

      Latika is staring at the television. Then an electric
      current seems to shoot through her and she is running,
      dodging the static traffic, street vendors, the odd
      cow, heading for her abandoned car. Hooting horns,
      shouting drivers. The phone rings on...


183   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      183

      And on...

                                 PREM
                   Doesn't look as if your friend
                   is in, Jamal. Who is it?

                                 JAMAL
                   My brother's number, but-

                                 PREM
                   - the sort of brother who'd go
                   for a walk on the twenty million
                   rupee question?

                                 JAMAL
                   It's the only number I know.

                                                           116.

      continues to ring...

                              PREM
                You're on your own, Jamal.

      Prem looks up at the gallery. The Director shakes his
      head, mimes cutting his throat.


186   INT. CAR. NIGHT.                                            186

      Latika wrestles the door open, grabs the phone.


187   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         187

      Prem opens his mouth to speak. Then, out of the
      darkness of the studio,

                                LATIKA V/O
                Hello?

      A gasp from the audience.

                                LATIKA V/O (CONT'D)
                Hello? Jamal?

                              PREM
                Wow! That's cutting it fine. I'm
                guessing this isn't your
                brother. This is-

                              LATIKA V/O
                My name is Latika.

      The first real smile of Jamal's adult life.



188   EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                              188

      A small smile spreads across the Inspector's face.

                              INSPECTOR
                That's why he's on the show.

      He picks up his hat and hastens out of the room.

                                                         117.


189   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. NIGHT.                           189

      Javed pulls the Bar Girl from him, stares open-mouthed
      at the television.

                               JAVED
                 What the bloody-?

      He pushes the girl off him. Gets to his feet.

                                  JAVED (CONT'D)
                 Latika! Salim!

                               PREM
                 Okay! So, Latika, you want to
                 hear the question one more time?
                 And let's be clear about this.
                 Twenty million rupees ride on
                 your answer. You have thirty
                 seconds. Jamal, please read out
                 the question to Latika.

                               JAMAL
                 Is that really you?

                                  LATIKA V/O
                 Yes.

                               PREM
                 The question, Jamal.

                               JAMAL

                 Three Musketeers, two of the

                 Where are you?

                                  LATIKA V/O
                 I'm- I'm safe.

                               PREM
                 Ten seconds. So, Latika, what do
                 you think?

      Silence.

                   Time's up! Your answer.

                   I don't know.

      The audience groan.

                                   PREM

                                 LATIKA V/O
                   I've never known.

                   Jamal. Your answer: for twenty
                   million rupees.

      Jamal shrugs.

                                   JAMAL
                   A.

                                   PREM
                   A. Because?

                                 JAMAL
                   Just...because.

                   Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.

      The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs
      around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his
      computer. Stares hard at Jamal.

                                 PREM
                   Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                   Musketeer was in the novel by
                   Alexandre Dumas. You used your
                   final life-line to phone a
                   friend. You answered A.
                   Aramis.....which is...I have to
                   tell you...the correct answer!

      Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal
      to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is
      smiling, but disorientated.

      To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

      The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at
      the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like
      an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic
      on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,
      faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.


192   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                192

      A small tv in the bathroom. Salim smiles.

                              JAVED O/S
                Salim! Teri ma ki chute! Salim!

      Javed is banging on the door. Salim gets up from where
      he has been praying. He climbs into the bath which is
      full of bank notes and lies down amongst the money. He
      reaches across for the pistol and picks it up. Smiles
      slightly as Javed smashes down the door, pulls the
      trigger and shoots Javed. He falls onto the floor,
      dead. But the Thug right behind him shoots Salim in the
      chest. He lies back in the bath, the faintest trace of
      a smile on his face as he stares at the pictures of
      Jamal on the tv.

                               SALIM
                God is good.

      Salim dies.

      Prem and Jamal are being posed by photographers. A
      giant-sized cheque for twenty million rupees is
      manhandled onto the floor by the Floor Manager and an
      Assistant amidst much cheering and laughter. Jamal is
      snapped next to a scowling Prem. The Inspector appears
      next to them.

      He takes Jamal by the arm, leads him backstage.



194   INT/EXT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                 194

      Jamal sits silent in the back seat next to the
      Inspector as he drives through the traffic. Then:

                                 JAMAL
                   Truth alone triumphs? I should
                   have known better.

      The Inspector stops the jeep. Unlocks the handcuffs.
      Holds the back door open for Jamal.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Thought you might need a lift,
                   Sir.

      He nods towards the outside world. Dazed, Jamal gets
      out.


195   EXT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    195

      Jamal finds himself    gazing up     at VT station. Slowly, he
      wanders inside. The    Inspector     takes the contents of the
      file and tears them    slowly in     half. Lets the pieces
      fall on the ground.    Gets back     in the jeep and drives
      away.

197   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    197

      VT station is awash with the evening commute. Thousands
      of people crowd the platforms, jostling the only still
      figure who is sitting at the base of the statue of
      Frederick Stevens. Jamal. Then there is a gap in the
      wall of bodies that swirls around him. Jamal gets to
      his feet.

                                   JAMAL
                   Latika?

      Then she is gone in the melee again. Only to reappear.


                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                        121.
197   CONTINUED:                                            197

                                 LATIKA
                   Jamal?

      Jamal forces himself through the people. Nothing will
      stop him. Latika too is shoving them aside until they
      are face-to-face. They stop, look at each other, hold
      each other's hands tight. The whole station seems
      frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being
      Jamal and Latika.

                                  LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   I thought we would meet again
                   only in death.

      He shakes his head.

                                 JAMAL
                   I knew you'd be watching.

      Jamal puts his hand on Latika's chin, turns her head
      gently so that she is facing him. He sees the knife
      scars on her cheek for the first time. She tries to
      turn her head, but he won't let her. Runs his hand
      slowly down the scar. Rests his hand there.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   This is our destiny.

      He gently kisses the scarred cheek.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   This is our destiny.

      The camera pulls back and back, rising above the
      station. The music starts and the frozen station comes
      alive, two thousand kurta-clad men and saree-clad women
      dancing in and out and on top of the trains, an unbound
      celebration of hope and humanity that has at its
      centre, Jamal and Latika.

               MONTAGE OF VARIOUS SHOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK

               Over this we hear a recording of Jack Kerouac's poem, San 
               Francisco which is accompanied by a BE-BOP trio. Kerouac's 
               poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco. We 
               come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street. We PAN OVER to "THE 
               CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE" and continue along to the ALLEYWAY 
               where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign 
               depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous "I'm looking into the 
               distance, having a brilliant thought" pose...

               CHARLIE MACKENZIE, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel 
               shirt and torn jeans, walks INTO THE FRAME, right in front 
               of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the 
               exact same pose. We PULL BACK to reveal that Charlie has a 
               bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the 
               alleyway. We FOLLOW Charlie into...

               INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE

               We FOLLOW him through the store. By day he is the Assistant 
               Manager, by night he is a poet.

               A MAN in his fifties, wearing a beret and a goatee is reading, 
               Charles Bukowski's, Playing The Piano Like a Percussive 
               Instrument, Until Your Fingers Begin To Bleed A Bit.

               Charlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes 
               writing in his handsome leather-bound poetry journal.

                                     CHARLIE

               CUSTOMER approaches.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Do you have the book On The Road by 
                         Jack Kerouac?

               Every day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in 
               to get copies of On The Road. Charlie is use to this and 
               without looking up he points to a huge, well marked display 
               of thousands of copies of On The Road. Another TOURIST COUPLE 
               approach.

                                     TOURIST
                         Do you have a copy of On The Road by 
                         Jack Kerouac?

               Again not looking up, Charlie just points.

                                     TOURIST
                         Thanks.

               EXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

               Charlie puts the "CLOSED" sign on the door and proceeds to 
               walk home.

               EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS

               The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the 
               BEBOP as he sees life, warts and all. As the streets become 
               less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own 
               FOOTSTEPS and, a COUPLE BICKERING. The streets become even 
               more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts 
               out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace. 
               RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger. 
               Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance. 
               Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto:

               HIS STREET

               He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an 
               apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his 
               window. A CRASHING sound from within.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HANDS

               taking papers out of a desk drawer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CHARLIE

               carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing 
               it. He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand. 
               Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               SHATTERED PICTURE FRAME

               with a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               CHARLIE

               finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of 
               his apartment, bat raised above his head ready to swing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HANDS

               clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them 
               into a dufflebag; the jewelry is followed by CD's.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CHARLIE

               pushing open his apartment door in a mock SWAT maneuver, 
               then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in 
               the bedroom. He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop 
               making a loud metal VITTSWINGGGG's sound. He freezes, 
               terrified.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BEDROOM

               where the HANDS, freeze.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               CHARLIE

               Like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce, waits two beats... 
               then springs Samurai style into...

               THE BEDROOM

               He freezes.

               REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL

               that the HANDS belong to the angelic blonde in the broken 
               picture. It's Charlie's girlfriend, SHERRI.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sherri! What are you doing?

                                     SHERRI
                         I'm leaving you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, thank God... I thought you were 
                         robbing our own home, because frankly, 
                         that's insane. I mean, what could 
                         you possibly gain by robbing your 
                         own home? I don't mean to meddle, 
                         but isn't it better to rob other 
                         peoples' homes? Start accumulating 
                         their wealth as opposed to just 
                         reaccumulating your own wealth.

                                     SHERRI
                         That's not funny, Charlie. I'm really 
                         leaving.

               She continues to pack. Charlie tries to unpack her things.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?! Just because we had a fight 
                         last night?

                                     SHERRI
                         We've had a fight every night for 
                         two months. Ever since I brought up 
                         the subject of marriage, you've found 
                         fault with everything I do. Why 
                         couldn't we have gotten married, 
                         Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (beat)
                         I'm too young to get married.
                              (begins putting her 
                              things back)
                         I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We 
                         love living together.

                                     SHERRI
                         It's been two years now. I need 
                         something more.

                                     CHARLIE
                         See, Sherri, this is frustrating for 
                         me, okay. When we first started going 
                         out I thought we agreed that we 
                         weren't the sort of people who got 
                         married.

                                     SHERRI
                         That's like saying we're not the 
                         sort of people who are going to grow 
                         old. We're not going to fall into 
                         that "growing old" trap. Face it, 
                         you've got a problem with commitment, 
                         Charlie. Take a look at your other 
                         girlfriends. Every time you get close 
                         to a commitment there's something 
                         wrong with them.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, I broke up with them for good 
                         reasons.

                                     SHERRI
                         What about Sandy?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sandy was an alcoholic.

                                     SHERRI
                         No-no-no. You thought she was an 
                         alcoholic. She just drank more than 
                         you drank. What about Jill?

                                     CHARLIE
                         She hated my family.

                                     SHERRI
                         You thought she hated your family. 
                         Nobody hates your family. Everybody 
                         loves your family. What about Julie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         She smelled like soup.

                                     SHERRI
                         What does that mean?

                                     CHARLIE
                         She smelled exactly like Campbell's 
                         Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty, 
                         physically dirty.

                                     SHERRI
                         Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're 
                         gonna say were my problems? Are you 
                         gonna tell your friends that I was a 
                         junkie, that I wasn't supportive 
                         enough or that I smelled like relish? 
                         Charlie, I loved you. It could have 
                         worked out.
                              (she goes to the door)
                         Think about it.

               She leaves.

               EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - CHARLIE'S CAR - DUSK

               Charlie and his best friend, TONY SPILETTI, are out for a 
               night on the town.

               Tony is second generation Italian-American with very 
               Mediterranean features. They're listening to Teenage Fan 
               Club. They pass Ghierardeli Square.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're 
                         Scottish you know?

                                     TONY
                         Oh.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I had that dream again.

                                     TONY
                         Oh, is that the one where you suspect 
                         that a fat man in a diaper, on a 
                         lazy susan has interfered with your 
                         plans for the evening?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, but I have had that one. No, in 
                         this one I'm in love...

                                     TONY
                         Yeah.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And I say to myself, 'I've finally 
                         found somebody that I'm truly 
                         comfortable with.' You know when 
                         you're so comfortable that you'll 
                         let them put makeup on you to see 
                         what you would look like if you were 
                         a girl. Anyways you know what I do 
                         in the dream next?

                                     TONY
                         You propose?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (after a pause)
                         No. I die.

                                     TONY
                         But Charlie, you're a normal suburban 
                         guy at heart, from a normal suburban 
                         family. Didn't you tell me you always 
                         wanted to get married and have a 
                         family.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There 
                         are seven main rites of passage in a 
                         man's life. Birth, first day of 
                         school, last day of school. Marriage. 
                         Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at 
                         marriage. I'm two rites of passage 
                         away from death.

                                     TONY
                         I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

               Tony is doing three-sixties, scoping out beauties, when 
               suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind 
               them. He slouches down into his seat.

                                     TONY
                         Christ. It's the cops.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tony, you are a cop.

                                     TONY
                         I know. Isn't it awful? I work with 
                         those guys. They're assholes.

               The police car passes.

               INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

               Tony and Charlie enter. There is a poet on stage. The club 
               is full of art tarts and college bohemians. They are greeted 
               by the club's owner, GIUSEPPI, an Italian man in his fifties.

                                     TONY
                         Salve zio mio.

                                     UNCLE
                         Allora? Che catzo fai, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi, Uncle Giuseppi.

                                     UNCLE
                         Tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa 
                         e' in galera per la terza volta.

               Tony's uncle shows them to a table.

                                     UNCLE
                         I'll have the waitress bring you 
                         cappuccino.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What did your uncle say?

                                     TONY
                         He says my Dad's back in jail again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ah, I'm sorry, man.

                                     TONY
                         You know, it's funny I don't even 
                         feel related to my parents anymore. 
                         I feel like your mom and dad are 
                         more like my parents. I feel more 
                         Scottish than Italian.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tony Spiletti, I don't think you 
                         could get more Italian than that. 
                         Unless of course your name was Tony 
                         Italian Guy.

               Charlie checks out the girls in the coffee bar.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm so bummed. Sherri was great, 
                         wasn't she? I'm an asshole, aren't 
                         I?

                                     TONY
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You've got to help me get through 
                         this night.

                                     TONY
                         You've just got to get back on the 
                         horse.

               The waitress arrives with two cappuccinos in extremely large 
               cups like they have in France.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Waitress, I'm sorry, there seems to 
                         be a mistake. I ordered the large 
                         cappuccino.

               Two girls at a nearby table, laugh. Charlie and Tony exchange, 
               "This could be promising." looks.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to the girls)
                         Do you think these cups could be 
                         larger? They're practically bowls.

               The girls laugh again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I feel like I'm having Campbell's 
                         Cuppuccino.

                                     TONY
                         Join us in a cup of coffee? There's 
                         enough room?

                                     GIRLS
                         Sure!

               The girls come over.

                                     SUSAN
                         My name's Susan and this is June. We 
                         think you're funny.

                                     TONY
                         My name's Tony. This is my friend 
                         Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Look, Tony, I'm going home. See you 
                         later, girls.

               Tony grabs him and pulls him aside.

                                     TONY
                         You really don't understand, do you? 
                         When a girl comes over to your table 
                         and says, 'I think you're funny.' It 
                         means you've pretty much been given 
                         the keys to the city. Charlie, this 
                         is big.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Perhaps you've confused me with 
                         someone who gives a shit. Here's 
                         what's gonna happen, Tony. We'll end 
                         up going out with them tonight, maybe 
                         even home with them. Well go out for 
                         two months. Soon she'll move in, 
                         we'll be happy, She'll want more of 
                         a commitment. I'll be terrified and 
                         I'll do something to ruin it. Just 
                         like I did with Sherri.

               He leaves. Tony is left with the two girls.

                                     JUNE
                         Poor, guy... He seemed so nice.

                                     TONY
                              (talking, choked up)
                         I just broke up with somebody as 
                         well. She left me high and dry.

               The girls try to comfort him.

               INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

               Three quarters of the furnishings and items have disappeared 
               with Sherri. Charlie sits dejectedly on the floor over his 
               Poetry Journal. He is missing Sherri. We see...

               CHARLIE'S FACE

               He looks out and is struck by an idea and begins to write.

               ANGLE ON THE JOURNAL

                                       I AM LONELY

               CHARLIE'S FACE

               Again he looks out, finds his inspiration and continues to 
               write

               IN THE JOURNAL

                                     IT'S REALLY HARD

               CHARLIE'S FACE

               A gentle tear rolls down his left cheek. He pauses, then 
               finishes off the stanza.

               IN THE JOURNAL

                                     THIS POEM SUCKS

               After the last line he scratches out the entire poem. He 
               closes the book and turns on the TV set to CNN to veg out. 
               The show is "What's Cooking! With Burt Wolf."

               EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET

               Charlie is driving in his car. He drives slowly looking for 
               an address. Finds it, slips in to a parking spot in front.

               EXT. BUTCHER'S SHOP - MEATS OF THE WORLD

               Adorning the front are a "GRAND OPENING" sign and miniature 
               flags of the world. Charlie goes inside.

               INT. BUTCHER'S SHOP

               It's a small, hip shop selling specialty meats from around 
               the world. Charlie looks around. Suddenly, an attractive 
               woman in her late twenties, wearing a blood-stained smock 
               enters. It is HARRIET MICHAELS. She has a cleaver in one 
               hand and something bloody in the other.

                                     HARRIET
                              (angry)
                         Goddamn shoplifter.
                              (conscious of Charlie's 
                              presence; holding up 
                              bloody meat)
                         But I got him!
                              (smiles)
                         You're next.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (backing out the door; 
                              terrified)
                         I've come at a bad time.

                                     HARRIET
                         No stay!

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, no, really... Obviously you've 
                         got things you have to do. You've 
                         got to dismember the rest of his 
                         bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow 
                         grave. Cover the body with quick 
                         lime. Really so much to do, so little 
                         time and I'm only in the way here, 
                         I'm just gonna go. Good luck.

                                     HARRIET
                              (referring to meat in 
                              hand)
                         Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he 
                         stole. This isn't a piece of him or 
                         anything. This is Icelandic Shank.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I bet it goes well with a nice 
                         Chianti. Fittfittfitt.

                                     HARRIET
                              (laughs)
                         Can I help you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes. Do you have haggis?

                                     HARRIET
                         Yes, we do. It's over here in our 
                         Scottish Cuts section. One?

               This is a section under glass flying a Scottish flag, with 
               haggis and various cuts of Scottish meat.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes! I've never been able to find 
                         haggis anywhere, except at my parents' 
                         house. They're Scottish.

               Harriet rounds the counter and wraps up the haggis. Behind 
               her is the large "PRUSSIAN VENISON" sign.

                                     HARRIET
                              (ringing up his order)
                         That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine. 
                         Will there be anything else?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes. I know it's a long shot, but 
                         you wouldn't by any chance happen to 
                         have any Prussian Venison?

                                     HARRIET
                         Now where in the world would I get 
                         Prussian Venison?

               Charlie's charmed.

               EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET

               Charlie is driving along listening to Kerouac. We absorb the 
               flavor of San Francisco as he drives down Lombard Street.

               EXT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               An old crappie apartment building in San Francisco. Charlie's 
               car pulls up. We hear "SATURDAY NIGHT" by the Bay City 
               Rollers.

               INT. OUTER HALLWAY OF CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Charlie approaches a door.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (calling up)
                         Mom, Dad, I'm here.

                                     STUART (O.S.)
                         We're in here, son.

               The apartment is a shrine to Scotland. Scottish paraphernalia, 
               miniature Scotty dogs, shortbread tins and, on wall, framed 
               pictures depict famous Scotsmen, Sean Connery, Jackie Stewart, 
               Alexander Graham Bell, James Doohan (Scottie from "Star 
               Trek"), Sheena Easton, Billy Connolly.

               CHARLIE'S POV - AS WE ENTER THE LIVING ROOM

               We see STUART, MAY, TONY, and little WILLIAM, Charlie's 
               fourteen year old little brother all singing:

                                     ALL
                              (singing)
                         S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... NIGHT

                                     STUART
                              (noticing Charlie)
                         Come give your old man a kiss or 
                         I'll kick your teeth in.

               The group are eating dinner on TV trays. Charlie walks over 
               and turns off the record.

                                     MAY
                         Charlie, put on Charlie Pride, would 
                         ya? Oh, I love Charlie Pride.
                              (begins singing; in 
                              thick Scottish accent)
                         HEY, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE MOST 
                         BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD...

                                     STUART
                         May, shut it.

               STUART MACKENZIE is in his late fifties, a butcher, with 
               Coke bottle glasses and thick head of black hair. His red-
               haired wife, MAY, is in her fifties, attractive with a soft, 
               but tough appearance. Little WILLIAM, has a very large head 
               and a skinny neck. Like Charlie, he was born in America.

               Charlie gives his Mom a hug, his father a kiss.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, William.

                                     WILLIAM
                              (on his stomach on 
                              the floor; watching 
                              TV)
                         Hey, Charlie.

                                     STUART
                         SCORES! MAGIC GOAL!

               On the television, Stuart's team, Glasgow Celtic, has scored.

                                     TONY
                         Aye -- magic.

                                     STUART
                         Let's have a look at the re-play. 
                         William, move your head. Look at the 
                         size of that ooy's heed. I'm not 
                         kidding. It's like an orange on a 
                         tooth pick.

                                     MAY
                         Stuart, you're going to give the boy 
                         a complex.

                                     STUART
                         I'm not kidding. That's a huge 
                         noggin'. It has it's own weather 
                         system. It's a virtual planetoid.
                              (shouting to William)
                         Heed! Move!

               We see the re-play of the goal on TV. Tony sits down and May 
               brings over a plate of stew and three types of potatoes, 
               piled very high.

                                     MAY
                         Is that enough potatoes, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Enough to recreate Devil's Tower in 
                         "Close Encounters".

                                     STUART
                              (sniffs the air)
                         Do I smell haggis?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Aye, you do.

                                     MAY
                              (taking it)
                         I'll put it in the frig.

               Charlie notices Tony reading some papers. He realizes it's 
               literature from the Lyndon H. LaRouche Society.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dad, what are you doing to Tony now? 
                         Why do you abuse his mind like this?

                                     STUART
                         That's the latest report from Lyndon 
                         H. LaRouche, outlining how the Queen 
                         and the Rothschilds masterminded the 
                         Soviet overthrow, so that they could 
                         reclaim lands they had annexed during 
                         the Holy Roman Empire.

                                     TONY
                              (goading Charlie)
                         You know a lot of this makes sense.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think you're suffering from the 
                         Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages 
                         start to relate to their captors.

                                     STUART
                         Listen, Sonny Jim, it's a known fact 
                         there's a society of the five 
                         wealthiest people in the world, called 
                         the Pentaverate, who run everything 
                         and meet three times a year at a 
                         secret country mansion in Colorado, 
                         known as "The Meadows."

                                     CHARLIE
                              (sarcastic)
                         And that's obviously why we haven't 
                         heard about it in the newspapers.

                                     STUART
                              (inappropriately angry 
                              & loud)
                         That's right. They fuckin' own the 
                         papers, smartass. And everything 
                         else. Why do you think Scotland's 
                         not been able to get independence? 
                         Because the Queen the Pentavirate 
                         and those English dome heads in West 
                         Minster won't have it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who are the other members of this 
                         pentaverate?

                                     STUART
                         The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys, 
                         the Vatican, and Colonel Sanders 
                         before he went tits up. Oh, I hated 
                         the Colonel with his wee beady eyes. 
                         And that smug look on his face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dad how can you hate "the Colonel?"

                                     STUART
                         Because the Colonel puts an addictive 
                         chemical in it that makes you crave 
                         it fortnightly.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Interesting... coo-coo

                                     MAY
                         Would anyone like a juice? Charlie, 
                         did I tell you, we bought a Juice 
                         Tiger?

                                     CHARLIE
                         A Juice Tiger?

                                     MAY
                         Aye, it's a juicer. It's part of my 
                         National Enquirer, Garth Brooks diet. 
                         Would you like potato juice?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Thank you, no.

                                     MAY
                         Sherri's late.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up.

                                     MAY
                         Oh, you didn't. Sherri was the 
                         daughter your father was never able 
                         to give me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm just not ready for marriage. I'm 
                         twenty-nine and my poems haven't 
                         even been published yet.

                                     STUART
                         But it's not just the poetry is it 
                         son? You're afraid if you get married 
                         you'll lose your muse. Look at me, I 
                         was a strapping young butcher, at 
                         the height of my creative powers. 
                         When it came to de-boning a side of 
                         beef, there was nobody that could 
                         touch me. Then I married your mother. 
                         And people would still stand in awe 
                         as I filleted a shoulder of lamb.

                                     MAY
                         Maybe it's just as well not to get 
                         married, look at the news. Where did 
                         I put it?

                                     STUART
                         Heed. Move that melon of yours into 
                         the bathroom and get the paper for 
                         your mother.

               William gets the National Enquirer and brings it back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's not news, Dad. That's bullshit. 
                         I wouldn't wipe my ass with that 
                         paper.

                                     STUART
                         What are you talking about? It's the 
                         fifth highest circulating paper in 
                         the United States, I'll have you 
                         know.

                                     MAY
                         Oh, here it is. Mrs. X. The Honeymoon 
                         Murderer. She marries men under fake 
                         identities, and then murders them. 
                         She killed some German martial arts 
                         expert, and some plumber named Ralph 
                         Elliot. Her whereabouts are unknown.

               There's another goal on the TV set.

                                     STUART

                         Ah, beautiful goal. We HOLD on the 
                         TV set.

               Time passes. The TV set

                                                               CROSS FADES:

               TO THE END OF THE GAME

               The two teams are shaking hands. And the final scores chyron 
               shows Celtic beating Rangers three nothing. We see Charlie 
               and Tony are leaving. Stuart is blind drunk.

                                     STUART

                              song)
                         YOU'RE IN MY EYES, YOU'RE IN MY 
                         DREAMS...
                         YOU'RE CELTIC, UNITED 
                         AND BABY I'VE DECIDED...

                         Ah, you're steaming.

               She meets Charlie and Tony at the door and kisses him good-
               bye. She turns to kiss Tony, and holds on the kiss far too 
               long.

                                     TONY
                              (pulling away)
                         See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie.

                         Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian 
                         bastard.

                                     CHARLIE
                         See you later, mom.
                              (calling out)
                         See you later, Dad.

                                     STUART
                         Fine. Go! You've stayed your hour.

               Charlie and Tony leave and enter...

               THE HALLWAY

               where they find William sitting on the stairs waiting for 
               them.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Take me with you.

               EXT. MEATS OF THE WORLD - LATE AFTERNOON

               Charlie's drives by and notices Harriet, who's unwinding the 
               store awning in Dutch national costume. The banner announces 
               "DUTCH WEEK." "MEATS OF THE WORLD SALUTES DUTCH MEAT."

               Charlie slows down to look at her. She looks great in her 
               little Dutch costume.

               INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - DAY

               Charlie is again writing at the counter. Another PERSON 
               enters.

                                     MAN
                         Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to 
                         have...

               Charlie again points to the Kerouac section without looking 
               up.

                                     MAN
                         Thanks.

               ON THE PAD

               Charlie writes...

               OH MEAT MAID, 
               IF THE CATTLE HAD HAD A CHOICE, THEY WOULD HAVE SLAUGHTERED 
               THEMSELVES 
               WILLINGLY 
               FOR A CHANCE 
               TO BE TOUCHED

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CHARLIE'S FACE

               She's on his mind.

               EXT. MEATS OF THE WORLD

               Charlie's car pulls up. The sign reads, "WELSH WEEK" "MEATS 
               OF THE WORLD SALUTES WELSH MEATS"

               INT. MEATS OF THE WORLD

               The store is very busy. There is a line at the meat counter 
               seven people deep. Charlie takes his place at the end of the 
               line.

               We see a montage of a persons hands chopping a rack of lamb 
               into lamb chops, and carving meat with surgical efficiency.

                                     HARRIET
                              (spotting Charlie in 
                              the crowd)
                         Oh, hi haggis, right?

                                     CHARLIE
                         It was a big hit.

                                     HARRIET
                              (finishing up with a 
                              customer)
                         I remember you told me you were 
                         Scottish, but do you really like 
                         haggis.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No. I think it's repellent in every 
                         way. In fact, I think most Scottish 
                         cuisine is based on a dare.

               Harriet laughs.

                                     HARRIET
                              (to the next customer)
                         Can I help you?
                              (to Charlie)
                         Sorry, I'm really busy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Look, um, my dad's a butcher, do you 
                         need a hand?

                                     HARRIET
                         Well, actually, Yes.

               Charlie puts on a very stylish butcher smock and crosses 
               behind the counter.

                                     HARRIET
                         Can you get me four Belgian 
                         porterhouses? Do you know what a 
                         porterhouse looks like?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm meat literate.

               Time passes we see a montage of Harriet and Charlie serving 
               customers. Ending on a customer's POV of Charlie.

                                     CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                         Yes, do you have any fresh blubber?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll check.
                              (pause)
                         You want blubber, right?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Yeah.

               We see Charlie's POV of an Eskimo with a "lower forty-eighth" 
               accent.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         My parents are coming to town. You 
                         know how parents are. They'll drive 
                         you nuts.

               The Eskimo exits, there are no customers left.

                                     HARRIET
                         Look, I'm really grateful. Can I 
                         offer you some meat as payment? 
                         Please, help yourself to some meat.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm trying to be a vegetarian.

                                     HARRIET
                         Trying to be a vegetarian?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, the problem is I really love 
                         hot-dogs.

                                     HARRIET
                         I think the meat industry invented 
                         hot-dogs to stop people from becoming 
                         vegetarians. There's got to be 
                         something I can do to repay you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You could take me to a nice romantic 
                         dinner.

               EXT. PIER - NIGHT

               Charlie and Harriet are eating hot-dogs. As Charlie puts the 
               relish on, he smells the relish.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (sniffing the relish)
                         This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.

                                     HARRIET
                         I hate talking about old 
                         relationships.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then let's not and say we did.

                                     HARRIET
                              (she laughs)
                         That was easy -- What a nice guy. 
                         You've probably never done a mean 
                         thing in your life.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You'd be surprised.

                                     HARRIET
                         I'd like to hear.
                              (to his confused look)
                         Name me something bad you've done in 
                         your life.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you kidding me?

                                     HARRIET
                         No. Did you ever steal anything? You 
                         ever hit someone?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, I've been in fights. Let me 
                         think.

                                     HARRIET
                              (as Charlie thinks)
                         Not one bad thing, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tell me something bad you've done. 
                         And it better be bad. I mean, evil.

                                     HARRIET
                         How evil?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Really evil.
                              (thinks)
                         Like how many people have you brutally 
                         murdered?

                                     HARRIET
                         "Brutal" is such a subjective word. 
                         I mean, what's brutal to one person 
                         might be totally reasonable to 
                         another.

               Next to them is a German couple, speaking German, looking 
               through a coin-operated binocular. He says something which 
               causes her to cry.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This just reminded her of that scene 
                         in "Brian's Song".

                                     HARRIET
                         Actually, he just proposed to her. 
                         Those are tears of joy.

               She lifts her soda to toast them.

                                     HARRIET
                         Prost.

               The man and woman smile and nod.

                                     MAN
                         Danke, Fraulein.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're very smart. It's a shame I'm 
                         going to have to destroy you.

                                     HARRIET
                         Do bright women intimidate you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, not at all.

                                     HARRIET
                         Really, what do you look for in women 
                         you date?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (thinks)
                         Well, I know everyone always say 
                         "sense of humor", but I'd have to go 
                         with breast size.
                              (she laughs)
                         How about you? In a guy.

                                     HARRIET
                         Income of course, and then...
                              (thinks)
                         ...savings.

               He smiles at her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Me likey how you thinkey.

               INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The lights turn on, and then they enter a very bohemian 
               apartment. There is artists paraphernalia strewn around. A 
               small bar separates the living area from the kitchen. She 
               smiles and walks off into the kitchen.

                                     HARRIET
                         I'll make us some tea.

               He checks out her apartment. On the wall there is a huge 
               poster of the BOARDWALK IN ATLANTIC CITY.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, you know what this apartment 
                         needs? A really large oversized poster 
                         of Atlantic City.

                                     HARRIET
                         I used to live there. That's where I 
                         had my first supermarket job.

               On his way out, he peeks into the bedroom, where he finds a 
               bed that is facing neither parallel nor perpendicular with 
               the wall. It is just kind of "there".

                                     HARRIET (O.S.)
                              (coming into room)
                         I only have chamomile. I hope that's 
                         all right.

               He looks at her and then at the "Oddly-placed" bed.

                                     HARRIET
                         It's North-South.
                              (to his confused look)
                         For health reasons. See... I had 
                         this friend, he was a martial arts 
                         expert. Anyways, he used to sleep 
                         North-South. I don't know... It's a 
                         martial arts thing and it just sort 
                         of became a habit with me.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (walking into living 
                              room)
                         You know Scotland has it's own martial 
                         arts. It's called FUCKU. It's mostly 
                         head butting and kicking people when 
                         they're on the ground.

               Harriet starts laughing. Then so does Charlie. They lean 
               into each other. Pretty close. Too close even, and when it 
               seems like they're going to kiss, Charlie suddenly gets 
               uncomfortable and looks at his watch.

                                     HARRIET
                         Late?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No. No. Not for me.

                                     HARRIET
                         Who for then?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who for then what?

                                     HARRIET
                         Well, you looked at your watch and 
                         said it wasn't late for you... I 
                         wondered who it was late for.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not me. No, Sir. Not here.
                              (after a pause; 
                              checking watch)
                         Maybe it is late.

               She gets him his coat. He starts to leave.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Look, the truth is, yes, I had a 
                         great time, and I'd like to kiss 
                         you, but if we do kiss, then we'll 
                         kiss on the couch and if we kiss on 
                         the couch, then we'll kiss in the 
                         bedroom, and once you're in the 
                         bedroom -- Well, the thing is, I 
                         always rush it. And this time I feel 
                         like maybe I should wait. Maybe we 
                         should let it build naturally and 
                         grow, instead of just immediately 
                         spending the night together.

                                     HARRIET
                         I want to spend the night together.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (sold)
                         I have no problem with that.

               THE BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

               They are both fast asleep. She is curled up in his arms. 
               Suddenly, she begins to speak.

                                     HARRIET
                         Yes! Yes!

               Charlie's eyes open. He smiles.

                                     HARRIET
                         Yes Ralph. I will. Ralph.

               Charlie's smile fades. He sits up and looks at her. She is 
               lying completely still on the bed, her eyes closed, and still 
               sleep-talking.

                                     HARRIET (O.S.)
                         Now now Ralph!

                                     CHARLIE
                              (waking her)
                         Harriet...? Harriet...?
                              (as her eyes open)
                         You were having a dream, or...? You 
                         kept saying the name Ralph.

                                     HARRIET
                         Ralph?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ralph. I heard you say it.

                                     HARRIET
                              (sleepily)
                         That's odd. Just today I was thinking 
                         about, her. She's a friend.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (starting to leave)
                         Is she nice --? Ralph...

                                     HARRIET
                         Yeah. She's great.

                                                             DISSOLVE INTO:

               INT. HARRIET'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Charlie is sleeping alone in the bed, and the sound of RUNNING 
               WATER is heard off in the distance. His eyes slowly open, he 
               looks around, remembers where he is. He puts on his shorts 
               and walks towards the bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

               Through the steam we can just make out Harriet in the shower 
               washing her hair. Charlie walks over.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know... with this drought in 
                         California total strangers are urged 
                         to shower together.

               He opens the curtain. It's not Harriet. The woman, ROSE, 
               calmly looks at him and closes the curtain.

                                     ROSE
                         Go away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh God. I'm sorry. Jesus. Excuse me.

               He backs out of the room.

               INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT

               The door opens and a hurriedly dressed Charlie emerges. Before 
               he gets to the door he once again encounters Rose. She's 
               completely dressed. Even her hair is dry.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi. I'm really sorry. I must have 
                         scared the... I'm Harriet's friend, 
                         Charlie, and you must be...
                              (hopefully)
                         Ralph?

                                     ROSE
                         I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this 
                         is Harriet's note.

               He reaches for it, but she reads it aloud to him.

                                     ROSE
                              (reading)
                         'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake 
                         you, make yourself at home, thanks 
                         for making me smile.' Harriet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's a very nice note.

                                     ROSE
                         I'll make you some breakfast.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Gee, I'd love to but I'm running 
                         late.

                                     ROSE
                         What would you say to blueberry 
                         pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape 
                         juice and Kona coffee?

               INT. KITCHEN - LATER

               Charlie and Rose sit at the table each eating a bowl of dry 
               cereal.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm sorry I didn't have any of those 
                         other things.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, that stuff'll kill you while 
                         Fruit Loops are light and probably 
                         reasonably high in Fiber. I like 
                         Apple Jacks too.

                                     ROSE
                         Got 'em.

                                     CHARLIE
                         So this is your apartment?

               Rose starts sketching Charlie.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes. She's been here the past three 
                         months... ever since she came back 
                         from Miami. I used to visit her 
                         occasionally. She didn't speak of 
                         me?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (shakes his head, no)
                         She told me about a martial arts guy 
                         and there was some discussion about 
                         Ralph...

                                     ROSE
                         She spoke of them...?

                                     CHARLIE
                         She spoke of the martial arts guy 
                         and screamed about Ralph...

                                     ROSE
                              (affectionately)
                         Well, you know Harriet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Actually, I really don't.

                                     ROSE
                              (puzzled)
                         But you did have sex with her?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (taken aback)
                         Hello.

                                     ROSE
                         Yet you still don't know her.
                              (contemplates this)
                         See, that's the problem with sex. 
                         It's not very revealing.

                                     CHARLIE
                         My, look at the time.

               He stands up.

                                     ROSE
                              (after a pause)
                         You should be careful, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I am... usually. I just... You should 
                         know, this is very unusual that I 
                         would do this so soon, in this day 
                         and age particularly, but... We just 
                         really hit it off. We did. And...

                                     ROSE
                         I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet 
                         that anything happened.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But... nothing did happen.

                                     ROSE
                         Exactly. Or she would be jealous. 
                         And when she gets jealous, we both 
                         know what she's capable of.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, we don't. You do, like I said, I 
                         just met her.

                                     ROSE
                         You'll be okay, Charlie. Just be 
                         careful.

               She leaves. Charlie is baffled.

               INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - DAY

               As Charlie walks by, FRED, a lanky customer in his late teens 
               is buying a book.

                                     FRED
                         Hey, Charlie. How you doin'?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Good. Good. Look, Fred...
                              (leaning in)
                         You got a lot of girlfriends, right? 
                         You know any girls named Ralph?

                                     FRED
                         Ralph? Gee, Charlie. Isn't that a 
                         guy's name?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, not necessarily, but... Never 
                         mind. Thanks, Fred.

               Charlie catches the store manager, PENNY, on her way into 
               her office.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey Penny, I wanted to ask you -- 
                         you know some girls named Ralph, 
                         right? I mean, that's a girl's name 
                         also, isn't it?

                                     PENNY
                              (confused)
                         I don't think so, Charlie... Uh...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (walking away)
                         Forget it. Thanks.

               She walks into her office totally confused.

               EXT. DOCKSIDE - ALCATRAZ TOUR KIOSK - MAINLAND - DAY

               Tony and Charlie are waiting in line.

               as they travel to the island.

                                     TONY (V.O.)
                         You know I've lived in this city all 
                         my life and I've never been to 
                         Alcatraz.

               ALCATRAZ

               We open on the LOUD BANGING of a CELL DOOR. We find our tour 
               group in the holding area. The PARK RANGER is a beefy man in 
               his late fifties and talks with emotionless, military 
               precision.

                                     PARK RANGER
                         Hello, everyone I'm a park ranger 
                         and I will be leading you on the 
                         tour. All the park rangers here at 
                         Alcatraz were at one time guards, 
                         myself included. My name is John 
                         Johnson, but everyone here calls me 
                         Vicki. Will you please follow me?

               They are led out. We see that Alcatraz is a sinister place. 
               Cold and unforgiving. The Park Ranger leads them to the center 
               of a cell block.

                                     TONY
                         You're glowing, Charlie. The man's 
                         in love.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sssh... Stop it. I'm trying to listen.

                                     PARK RANGER
                         This is the main cell block area. 
                         Home to such famous criminals as Al 
                         Capone, Micky Cohen, Joseph "Dutch" 
                         Critzer, and Robert Stroud, the famous 
                         Bird Man of Alcatraz. Follow me, 
                         please.

               The Park Ranger leads them past the famous visiting rooms, 
               the mess hall, all the way to the solitary confinement area.

               A CELL

                                     PARK RANGER
                         This is the cell for solitary 
                         confinement, that over the years has 
                         come to be known as Times Square.

               Tony and Charlie are at the back of the tour group.

                                     TONY
                         So did you and Harriet?... you know...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (grinning)
                         Sssh I don't want to talk about it.

                                     TONY
                         With that look, you don't have to 
                         talk about it. The grin alone could 
                         get you five to seven years.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tony, get your mind out of the gutter. 
                         All you need to know is that she's a 
                         sweet, kind and loving person.

                                     PARK RANGER
                         Now this is something none of the 
                         other tour guides will tell you. In 
                         this particular cell block Machine 
                         Gunn Kelly had, what we call in the 
                         prison system, a "bitch." And one 
                         day, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a 
                         makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut 
                         out his "bitch's" eyes.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Look, what can I tell you. I'm 
                         smitten. I'm in deep smit. I dunno. 
                         I just don't wanna talk about it, 
                         because then I start analyzing and 
                         that's not good for me.

                                     TONY
                         Good. I think that's good. Just let 
                         it happen.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Exactly. That's what's gonna be 
                         different this time. Something strange 
                         happens, let it go. It's not my 
                         business... Like Ralph. She says 
                         Ralph in her sleep.

                                     TONY
                         Who's Ralph?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover, 
                         I don't want to know.

                                     TONY
                         Good.

                                     PARK RANGER
                         And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't 
                         enough retribution for Kelly, the 
                         next day he and four other inmates 
                         took turns pissing into the "bitch's" 
                         ocular cavity.

               Tony and Charlie look at each other. They're a little queasy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Exactly.
                              (beat)
                         Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw 
                         this one up.

               INT. EL TORO - IN THE MISSION - DAY

               They are eating Bay burrites.

                                     ROSE
                         Did you have a nice date last night?

                                     HARRIET
                         Rose, I don't really --

                                     ROSE
                         He disturbed me while I was naked in 
                         the shower this morning.

                                     HARRIET
                         Yeah, he stayed over?

                                     ROSE
                         I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed 
                         about it over breakfast.

                                     HARRIET
                         That's good.

                                     ROSE
                         He said you had great sex last night.

                                     HARRIET
                         He did?
                              (a beat)
                         Yeah.

                                     ROSE
                         He seems really stuck on you. I hope 
                         for you that it lasts.

                                     HARRIET
                         Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving 
                         person. We like each other, but I 
                         don't want to think any further. 
                         It's taken me a long time to get 
                         back to dating, and I want to take 
                         things real steady this time.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, you can trust me not to tell 
                         him anything.

                                     HARRIET
                         He was quite happy not to talk about 
                         the past.

                                     ROSE
                         I did a sketch of him.

               Rose shows the sketch to Harriet.

                                     HARRIET
                              (looking at the picture)
                         That's good.

                                     ROSE
                         Think I've caught him?

                                     HARRIET
                         The eyes are good.

                                     ROSE
                         Charlie really liked it.

                                     HARRIET
                         It's a good likeness.

                                     ROSE
                         Boy, I really hope it works out.

                                     HARRIET
                         Rose, I don't wanna screw this one 
                         up.

               EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Charlie enters the building, holding a handful of poetry 
               books. He passes a UNIFORMED DELIVERY GUY coming out. The 
               guy nods and Charlie nods back.

               INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

               Charlie gets three feet down the hallway. Stops in his tracks 
               and heads back to the front door. He opens it and yells to 
               the delivery guy:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, uh... Ralph...?

                                     DELIVERY GUY
                              (turning around)
                         I'm Gilbert.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Shit.

               HARRIET'S DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

               She opens the door enough to see that she is wearing only a 
               blouse that goes below her hips. She looks fantastic. He 
               hands her the poetry books.

                                     HARRIET
                              (teasing him)
                         Charlie, they're beautiful. I'll put 
                         them right in water.

               He follows her inside and puts the books on the bureau. He 
               goes over and kisses her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You look great.

                                     HARRIET
                         I was just getting dressed.
                              (picking up skirt off 
                              couch)
                         What do you think of this skirt?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Honestly?
                              (pulls her close)
                         I'd leave it off.

                                     HARRIET
                         So then you think I could go to a 
                         poetry concert like this?

               She drops the skirt and stands there. She's fantastic.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let's forget the poetry concert. 
                         It's already been nine hours since I 
                         last made love to you.

                                     HARRIET
                              (smiling; walking 
                              away)
                         Come on we're meeting your best 
                         friend. I wanna look good. The second 
                         I go to the ladies room he's gonna 
                         tell you what he really thinks of 
                         me.

               He follows her to the bedroom door, constantly trying to 
               kiss her.

                                     HARRIET
                         Come on, Charlie. We have to be there 
                         in fifteen minutes.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (following her into 
                              bedroom)
                         Fifteen minutes. Perfect.

               She closes the door on his face.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (through door)
                         Maybe later.

                                     ROSE (O.S.)
                         I thought of calling you.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (startled)
                         Aaaahhh!

               Charlie turns on his heel. Rose has appeared out of nowhere.

                                     ROSE
                              (after a pause)
                         To warn you, Charlie.
                              (after a pause)
                         There are just some things you should 
                         know, about Harriet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         About Harriet?

                                     ROSE
                         About her past.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't wanna know. I mean, look 
                         everyone has some skeletons in their 
                         past. I only care about the future. 
                         Not the past.

                                     ROSE
                         Here's the thing. I may have to tell 
                         Harriet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tell her what?

                                     ROSE
                         That we're lovers.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're not lovers.

                                     ROSE
                         I know, and it's a damn shame.

               Harriet walks in the room, fully dressed, and fully dazzling.

                                     HARRIET
                         I hope I'm not interrupting.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (feeling weird)
                         No, not at all. We were just talking 
                         about... Rose and I met yesterday, 
                         so...

                                     HARRIET
                         So I heard.

               Harriet hugs Rose and then stands right next to her.

                                     HARRIET
                         So, don't you think we look alike?

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, we do not. Harriet was always 
                         prettier than me. And a heck of a 
                         lot more popular. She always had 
                         boyfriends. The only thing I ever 
                         got was good grades.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (slightly uncomfortable)
                         Good grades are good.

                                     HARRIET
                         She's just being kind. Show Charlie 
                         one of your photographs, Rose. Rose 
                         is a great artist.

                                     ROSE
                         No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're 
                         not good.

                                     HARRIET
                         You're so modest. If I weren't here 
                         to brag for you, I just don't know...
                              (taking out a 
                              posterboard from 
                              cabinet)
                         Show it to him, Rose. Do it.

               He turns it over and there is a picture there. A collage of 
               unrelated images put together. And it is beautiful.

               But it's very abstract. Violent perhaps. Confused definitely. 
               He likes it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's beautiful...

                                     ROSE
                         Thanks.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What is it?

                                     ROSE
                         I dunno.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you call it?

                                     ROSE
                         I dunno.

                                     CHARLIE
                         A lot artists don't like to title 
                         their work. They feel it biases the 
                         viewer.

                                     ROSE
                         It is titled. It's called "I dunno".

               Charlie looks at it again, then at Rose, then at Harriet. 
               It's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for 
               Rose. A hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty.

                                     HARRIET
                         We should get going, Charlie. Thanks, 
                         Rose... See you later.

                                     ROSE
                         Bye, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Rose, great to see you. We should 
                         all go out together some time. The 
                         three of us. That would be great. 
                         That would be... interesting.

               Charlie and Harriet walk out.

               EXT. POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT

               Charlie and Harriet wait in line with bohemian types and 
               poetry lovers from the suburbs, and all walks of life. 
               Directly behind them are TWO OLD LADIES. The marquee reads: 
               "POETRY FESTIVAL - TONIGHT ALLEN GINSBERG."

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think you're going to love Alan 
                         Ginsberg. He's great.

                                     HARRIET
                         Oh, I know all about him.

                                     TONY (O.S.)
                         Hey Charlie!

               Tony is getting out of a cab accompanied by Susan, the girl 
               from Spiletti's Coffee House. He approaches Charlie.

                                     TONY
                         Sorry we're late.

               Tony throws his arms wide open and hugs one of the Little 
               Old Ladies on the other side of Charlie.

                                     TONY
                         You must be Harriet. I've heard a 
                         lot about you.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Tony; re: Harriet)
                         This is Harriet.

                                     TONY
                         Oh. Sorry. Of course.
                              (whispering to Harriet)
                         I apologize. Charlie described you 
                         as much older. And heavier.

                                     HARRIET
                              (smiling)
                         Oh, he did...?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Thank you, Tony. This is my best 
                         friend.

                                     TONY
                         And this is Susan. Charlie, you 
                         remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes, I do.

                                     SUSAN
                         You're funny...

               Then she GIGGLES. The girls start inside, Tony lags back 
               with Charlie.

                                     TONY
                              (whispers to Charlie)
                         I give Susan one night.

               INT. POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT

               ALLEN GINSBERG is on stage. He is brilliant. Tony, Charlie, 
               and Harriet are all amused. Susan is bored stiff. Charlie is 
               looking at Tony. Tony glances over at Susan and gives Charlie 
               an "Oh, well." look. Then he looks at Harriet and nods in 
               approval of her.

               EXT. FISHERMAN'S WHARF - NIGHT

               The four of them walk along the wharf. Charlie is at one of 
               those arcade games where you throw bean bags at the puppets 
               and try and knock them down. Charlie knocks two down.

                                     ARCADE MAN
                         One more and you get your pick.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Harriet)
                         You do it.

                                     HARRIET
                         No, Charlie. I'm the worst.

                                     TONY
                         Come on, you'll be great...

               The arcade man turns around to watch. Harriet winds up and 
               throws the bean bag directly into his neck.

                                     ARCADE MAN
                         Hey!

                                     HARRIET
                         Sorry... I told you Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, no, you're okay, you're just 
                         having control problems.

               They both start laughing. He puts his arm around her. In the 
               b.g. the wounded arcade man is being led away by a co-worker.

               They continued down the boardwalk stand in front of a House 
               of Horrors.

               It looks somewhat run down and Harriet looks questioningly 
               at Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know this is really, really cheesy, 
                         but in a way this is one of the places 
                         in San Francisco I'm most proud of.

                                     HARRIET
                         Yeah, let's go in.

               Tony nods agreement. Susan looks bored. They go inside the

               HOUSE OF HORRORS

               it's as low rent as Charlie described. The "KEEPER OF THE 
               THRESHOLD" so described in a poorly written sign, is an 
               overweight man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a 
               denim jacket and a little bit of scary makeup. He looks like 
               a roadie for the band, KISS. He stands at a podium, smoking 
               and reading a paper. As Charlie, Tony, Harriet and Susan 
               pass the Threshold Keeper, he takes a casual drag of his 
               cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment 
               utters:

                                     THRESHOLD KEEPER
                         Boo.

               INT. WAX MUSEUM - DAY

               Harriet and Charlie enter Bill's Wax Museum. The OWNER of 
               the wax museum greets them.

                                     OWNER
                         Hi. I'm Bill, welcome to my wax 
                         museum.

               They walk over to the exhibits. There are exhibits of Abraham 
               Lincoln, Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton. As they look more 
               closely they notice that the faces are exactly the same as 
               Bill's. They laugh.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Pouring rain. THUNDER. Charlie and Harriet, wrapped in each 
               others arms, walking through the rain.

                                     HARRIET
                         I feel so safe with you right now. 
                         You're never going to leave me, are 
                         you? I feel like I could be here 
                         forever.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TIGHT SHOT OF RAIN HITTING CHARLIE'S PANIC-STRICKEN FACE

                                                         MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

               THE REFLECTION OF RAIN ON CHARLIE'S PANIC-STRICKEN FACE

               PULL BACK to see Charlie in bed. He lies awake on his side, 
               his back up to Harriet's. She is sound asleep. Suddenly:

                                     HARRIET
                              (sleeptalking)
                         Ralph! No, Ralph!

               Charlie sighs, then just shrugs and tries to fall asleep. 
               What can he do.

               FADE IN:

               INT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Charlie and Harriet wait outside his parents' door.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, this is it.

                                     HARRIET
                         It'll be fine.

               They enter the door.

               INT. CHARLIE'S PARENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               We again move along the hallway. We pass the Scottish wall, 
               of fame, Scottie from "Star Trek", Sir Walter Scott, Sir 
               Harry Lauder, Sheena Easton, Al Pacino, Billy Connolly, then 
               the CAMERA BACKTRACKS to Pacino, where it HOLDS MOMENTARILY.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mom, Dad, we're here.

               May comes up, wearing a fancy country and western outfit.

                                     MAY
                         Ah, Charlie is this the wee Harriet. 
                         Ah, she's beautiful.

                                     HARRIET
                         Thank you.

                                     MAY
                         She's so sweet. I hope you keep her.
                              (calling)
                         Stuart, come out here. You tube.

               When he comes up, Stuart is wearing only a shirt with his 
               boxer shorts.

                                     STUART
                         Ah, it's the wee Harriet.

                                     MAY
                         Stuart, put your pants on.

                                     STUART
                         Hold your horses.
                              (calling to William)
                         Heed! Pants!

               William comes around the corner with his pants.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dad, what's Al Pacino doing on the 
                         Scottish wall of fame?

                                     STUART
                         Oh, that's for Tony. So, Charlie 
                         tells me you're a butcher. Let's 
                         talk meat.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dad, no one wants to talk shop. 
                         Especially butcher shop.

                                     STUART
                         Come here.

               Stuart gets him in a half-Nelson.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ah! Dad, dad I have a back zit, man 
                         it kills.

               Charlie struggles to free himself. Stuart turns to greet 
               Harriet. As he reaches out his hand.

               Totally instinctively, Harriet grabs Stuart's hand and twists 
               it behind his back. Charlie is startled, as his date has 
               just gotten Stuart into a Half-Nelson.

                                     HARRIET
                              (releasing his hand)
                         I'm sorry. I just... You just 
                         surprised me. I'm sorry.

                                     STUART
                         I like this one Charlie. She's quite 
                         a filly.

                                     HARRIET
                         I'm really embarrassed.

                                     STUART
                         Don't be embarrassed about having a 
                         good strong butcher's grip. Do you 
                         link your own sausage?

                                     MAY
                         Oh, ignore him. Come have a look at 
                         some photos of Charlie when he was a 
                         wee'n.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh Mom, don't start with the pictures.

                                     MAY
                         Ah, Charlie, lighten up. You've got 
                         a pickle up your ass.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (whispering to Harriet)
                         I'm gonna use the bathroom. You be 
                         okay alone with them?

                                     HARRIET
                              (kissing)
                         Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry.

               They smile as he leaves the room.

                                     STUART
                         Make sure there's paper, Charlie.

               Charlie picks up the pace, scared of what he might hear next.

                                     MAY
                         Make sure you leave the seat down.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (shutting her up)
                         Ma, just show her the pictures.

                                     STUART
                         And light a match.

                                     MAY
                              (to Harriet)
                         He always leaves the seat up. He's 
                         gotta learn.

               INT. BATHROOM AT PARENTS' - NIGHT

               He closes the door, and shakes his head. What can he do? 
               Those are his parents. On the wall opposite the toilet is a 
               well-used dart board with pictures of the Queen Mother and 
               Colonel Sanders. Hooked to the magazine caddie is a small 
               container of darts.

               INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               May excitedly shows Harriet family photo albums.

                                     MAY
                         This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky. 
                         He's a policeman in Canada. And our 
                         cousins Ruth and Jack. He's just got 
                         a restraining order from his wife. 
                         She's a lovely girl. This is Billy. 
                         He's a member of parliament. He 
                         drinks.

                                     HARRIET
                         What a nice family you have.

               CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM

               He doesn't seem in any hurry to leave either. He listens 
               through the door to Harriet enthusiastically looking through 
               old photos.

               Charlie glances down at a stack of National Enquirers on the 
               magazine rack. He flips through a few.

               He sees one of the absurd headlines: "ALIEN UFO SEX DIET" 
               Charlie shakes his head.

                                     HARRIET (O.S.)
                              (through door)
                         Charlie was the cutest baby.

                                     STUART (O.S.)
                              (through door)
                         You okay in there, Charlie? You didn't 
                         fall in, did you?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (through door)
                         Jesus...

               Charlie then looks down at another article in the Enquirer 
               and reads:

               "WHO'S NEXT FOR MRS. X - THE HONEYMOON KILLER?"

               It is the article about Mrs. X -- the axe-murderer who kills 
               her husbands on their honeymoons and then marries again under 
               a different identity.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM

               May is quickly flipping through a photo album, pointing out 
               pictures of relatives as she goes:

                                     HARRIET
                         I can't believe the resemblance 
                         between you and Charlie, Mrs. 
                         MacKenzie.

               INT. CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM

               With Harriet speaking in the b.g., Charlie continues reading, 
               now absorbed in the article about the 3 victims:

                                     HARRIET (O.S.)
                              (through door)
                         You have the same smile. It's so 
                         incredible.

               "VICTIM #1 - THE GERMAN MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT FROM MIAMI"

               "VICTIM #2 - THE LOUNGE SINGER FROM ATLANTIC CITY"

               "VICTIM #3 - THE SAN FRANCISCO PLUMBER - RALPH ELLIOT"

               INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - NIGHT - C.U. - HARRIET'S FACE

               Sitting in the front seat of Charlie's car, smiling, content, 
               a great meal, a great night out with Charlie and a nice 
               evening with his parents.

               Slowly PAN across the front seat to Charlie. A nervous anxious 
               "what the hell am I getting myself into" look on his face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         So, that was some move you put on my 
                         Dad, there. Did you study Karate, 
                         or...?

                                     HARRIET
                         No. Not officially. I dated a guy 
                         for a while who ran a studio.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, the martial arts expert. The 
                         north-south guy. Here in San 
                         Francisco?

                                     HARRIET
                         Actually, Miami.

               He looks straight ahead, trying to act unfazed. But, he's 
               very phased -- his expression is covered in it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Was that before Atlantic City, or 
                         after?

                                     HARRIET
                         Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic 
                         City was recent. I didn't care for 
                         Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers 
                         and lounge singers.

               He keeps driving.

               INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

               Charlie walks through the precinct towards Tony's office, 
               holding the National Enquirer in his hand.

                                     DESK SERGEANT
                         Hey Charlie!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is Tony back there?

               The Sergeant nods and Charlie heads back to the office.

               INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

                                     CAPTAIN
                         O.K., Tony. Do you have the K673 
                         form completed yet, that street vendor 
                         incident on Powell Street?

                                     TONY
                              (really bummed)
                         Yes, Captain.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Tony, do you mind my saying that you 
                         seem a little down?

                                     TONY
                         Captain. It's about my work. About 
                         being a policeman.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm 
                         here to listen.

                                     TONY
                         I know. And that's what's irritating, 
                         you're too nice.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Too nice!?

                                     TONY
                         Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes. 
                         You should be constantly on my case, 
                         like the captain on Starsky and Hutch. 
                         Once a week you should routinely 
                         haul my ass into your office, accuse 
                         me of being a maverick and complain 
                         to me that you're sick and tired of 
                         defending my screwball antics to the 
                         commissioner.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't 
                         report to a commissioner. I report 
                         to a committee, some of whom are 
                         appointed, some elected and the 
                         remainder co-opted on a bi-annual 
                         basis. A quorum --

                                     TONY
                         Police work should be all about 
                         running around, following up crazy 
                         hunches that turn out to be right, 
                         going out on a limb.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Well Tony, I've never seen it that 
                         way. For me police work is all about 
                         following procedure and remaining 
                         accountable to the general public.

                                     TONY
                              (exasperated)
                         Captain! When I joined the police 
                         force, I thought I was going to be 
                         Serpico and unfortunately I ended up 
                         being Toma. I would have settled for 
                         Beretta.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed 
                         that you should be so disillusioned.

               Charlie enters.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the 
                         way here. You guys probably have 
                         something you want to talk about, 
                         and Tony, if you've still got stuff 
                         you want to sort out, please, you 
                         know where the suggestion box is.

               The Captain exits.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nice guy. Hey, what's up?

                                     TONY
                         I'm having doubts about being a cop 
                         again. It's not like how it is on 
                         cop shows. All I do is fill out papers 
                         and reports.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let me get this straight, your Captain 
                         hasn't threatened to have you up on 
                         charges so fast you won't know what 
                         hit you?

                                     TONY
                         No! He's never once said to me that 
                         he was going to "throw the book at 
                         me so hard it'll knock my ass from 
                         here till Tuesday." Anyways what's 
                         up?

               Charlie pulls out the National Enquirer (the one on MRS. X, 
               the Honeymoon Killer).

                                     CHARLIE
                         Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X? 
                         She murders her husbands on their 
                         honeymoons and then changes her 
                         identity and marries again.

                                     TONY
                         I never heard of it. So what?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Curious, that's all. I read about 
                         it, and...
                              (after a pause)
                         I think I'm dating Mrs. X.

                                     TONY
                              (after a pause)
                         Two words, Charlie. Get therapy. 
                         They have doctors that deal 
                         specifically with this illness.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Everything's adding up, Tony. One of 
                         the victims was a martial arts expert. 
                         Last night at dinner, she put a 
                         martial arts move on my dad.

                                     TONY
                         There about twenty thousand people 
                         in San Francisco who are martial 
                         arts experts. Should I arrest all of 
                         them too?

                                     CHARLIE
                         If they also say Ralph in their sleep 
                         I think it'd be a good start.
                              (showing him paper)
                         Ralph Elliot. A plumber from San 
                         Francisco. Missing since his 
                         honeymoon.

                                     TONY
                         You're just getting scared. Like the 
                         dream, you feel Harriet could be the 
                         one, so you start to suspect her of 
                         things, 'cause deep down you're scared 
                         that if she is the one, you'll marry, 
                         and marriage to you is death.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay? 
                         They're my dreams. Analyze your own 
                         dreams.
                              (a beat)
                         It's not a marrying thing, Tony. 
                         It's a murdering thing.
                              (showing him paper)
                         Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right? 
                         Well so did this guy, right around 
                         the same time she left town.

                                     TONY
                              (reading article)

                         name for himself for being able to 
                         sing in six different languages the 
                         song "Only You".
                              (putting paper down)
                         Does she know the song "Only You?"

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know. It hasn't come up yet.

                                     TONY
                         Charlie, move past it. You're running 
                         your life by the National Enquirer.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (defensively)
                         What? It's the fifth highest 
                         circulating newspaper in the United 
                         States.

                         Mrs. X. Please. Look it up.

               COMPUTER ROOM AT POLICE STATION - MINUTES LATER

               Charlie and Tony are in the back with KATHY, a stocky black 
               woman in uniform, who works in the files department.

                                     KATHY
                         There's no record of any deaths. All 
                         three of these guys were reported 
                         missing around the time of their 
                         honeymoon, but so were the wives. No 
                         pictures of any of the brides. For 
                         all we know they just picked up and 
                         moved away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And Ralph Elliot, too?

                                     TONY
                         Charlie, you're talking about three 
                         guys over a seven year span. That's 
                         hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in 
                         this state, as of this day, is still 
                         not illegal.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (re: the article)
                         Yeah well murder is. And this article 
                         says that these men were murdered by 
                         the same woman.

                                     KATHY
                         Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that, 
                         most National Enquirer articles are 
                         actually based on our own police 
                         reports. They take the facts and 
                         fabricate a story around them.

                                     TONY
                         It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize 
                         that. I mean, personally, I would 
                         lie to you, but Kathy... has this 
                         crazy notion of always telling the 
                         truth.
                              (patting his back)
                         You feel better now?

                                     CHARLIE
                         It guess so. It's just... if I had a 
                         photo of Harriet, I could show it to 
                         the relatives or friends of Mrs. X's 
                         victims to identify her.

                                     TONY
                         Charlie, listen to me! There is no 
                         Mrs. X! Drop it! Okay?

               INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - EVENING

               Charlie knocks on the door. Rose answers.

                                     ROSE
                              (thrilled)
                         You're back. But Harriet's not here 
                         yet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Maybe I could wait.

                                     ROSE
                         Sure. That would be fine.

               She then starts to slowly close the door. He props it open 
               with his hand.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Inside? I was hoping...

                                     ROSE
                              (letting him in)
                         I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to 
                         be so forward. I mean, if you're 
                         waiting inside, then you feel 
                         obligated to entertain me and keep 
                         up the conversation just to be polite, 
                         and really your head might be totally 
                         elsewhere and then there's the chance 
                         that you would really want to talk 
                         and it's me who'd be busy, but in an 
                         attempt not to be rude, I sit there 
                         and listen to some story that you 
                         don't really want to tell and I don't 
                         really have time to hear. You know?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I couldn't agree with you more.

                                     ROSE
                         I think about a lot of things.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Look, if you have work to do, you go 
                         right ahead.
                              ("ah, here's an angle")
                         I mean, to tell you the truth, I'd 
                         love to see your work.

                                     ROSE
                         Okay! What would you like me to do?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, I don't want to see you work. I 
                         was talking about your work. Your 
                         photographs. That one that I saw was 
                         so, wonderful, and...

                                     ROSE
                         Harriet's far more talented than I 
                         am.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, I'm sure it's so subjective 
                         anyway and...
                              (out of patience)
                         Rose, show me your photos.

               CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS

               There are two kinds. Beautiful travel pictures and very erotic 
               black and white portraits of young men and women. All with a 
               slight sadomasochistic quality. At the bottom of every photo 
               is says: "Seasons Greetings".

                         Hey, these are some interesting photos 
                         here. Very impressive. Nice shots of 
                         Sauselito and... some good bondage 
                         shots. A lot of people wouldn't think 
                         to mix the two subjects, but they're 
                         really a natural together.
                              (new thought)
                         Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any 
                         pictures of Harriet by chance, would 
                         you?

                              (re: her cards)
                         Well, I don't think she'd wanna do 
                         this sort of...

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, no, not that. Just, in general 
                         some photos. Any little snapshot 
                         would do.

                                     ROSE
                         I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates 
                         being photographed.

               The sound of a key in the door as Harriet enters the 
               apartment.

                                     HARRIET (O.S.)
                         Rose -- did I see Charlie's car out 
                         in front?

                                     ROSE
                         We're in here, Harriet.

                                     HARRIET
                              (walking in)
                         What are you guys doing?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (covering up)
                         Oh, nothing. Just looking through 
                         some of Rose's work.

                                     ROSE
                         ...Charlie wanted a photo of you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And that. That too.

                                     HARRIET
                         Why of me, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, sentimental reasons. Something 
                         to remind me of you when we're not 
                         together.

               She takes him in her arms and gives him a knee buckling kiss.

                                     HARRIET
                         There, can you remember that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay, it's just, I was gonna give 
                         one to my parents, too, and...
                              (getting nowhere)
                         Another time would be fine. It's 
                         hardly a matter of life and death.

                              (ON TV)
                         In the news tonight, regarding a 
                         Beverly Hills Jeweler, Morris Cohan, 
                         who died last week, police are now 
                         suspecting that Morris's partner, 
                         Lawrence Sachs, may have murdered 
                         him with an untraceable poison.

               Reveal: we are in...

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Charlie is on a Stair Master, as Harriet walks in wearing a 
               robe. The TV is on in the b.g.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Where you been?

                                     HARRIET
                         Downstairs. I have a surprise for 
                         you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Great. I just wanna do a quick twenty 
                         minutes on the Stair Master before 
                         bed.

               Harriet drops her robe, and from over her shoulder we see 
               that Charlie prefers what he sees to working out.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll do forty tomorrow.

                                     HARRIET
                              (getting into bed)
                         I got something much healthier for 
                         you than that.

               She pulls out a milkshake from behind her back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What is it?

                                     HARRIET
                         It's a health shake. Eggs, malt, 
                         cinnamon, oranges. It's great. I 
                         mixed it up downstairs.

               THE TV SET

               continues on about poisons and poisoners. Charlie glances at 
               it.

                              (ON TV)
                         Poisoning has become the second 
                         leading method of murder in recent 
                         years, due to...

               Charlie watches the TV, looking a bit disturbed. Harriet 
               offers him the shake.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, look, I'm full. Dinner and... 
                         No...

                                     HARRIET
                         You'll like it Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, really, thanks.

                                     HARRIET
                              (putting it up to his 
                              lips)
                         You won't try it. I spent twenty 
                         minutes making it.

               He takes it. Lifts it to his mouth... then puts it on the 
               table.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (sniffing it)
                         Ummm. Smells good. Maybe I'll take 
                         some to the office tomorrow.
                              (running into bathroom)
                         I'm gonna brush my teeth. Be right 
                         back.

               Charlie goes into the bathroom.

               CHARLIE'S BATHROOM

               Harriet comes into the bathroom and lays the empty glass 
               down on the counter.

                                     HARRIET
                         I'm gonna take a quick shower.

               Charlie notices the empty glass on the counter.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Harriet, where did the shake go?

                                     HARRIET
                         What do you care? I drank it.
                              (getting into shower)
                         You could have at least tried it. 
                         You make me feel bad sometimes, 
                         Charlie. I don't know why.

               With her in the shower, he sneaks back into the bedroom and 
               checks the trash can. Nothing. Then he runs around the bed 
               to the other trash can. Nothing.

               He looks thoroughly confused as she enter the bedroom, wearing 
               a towel. She takes the towel off as she slips underneath the 
               covers. He gets into bed next to her. She gives him a kiss.

                                     HARRIET
                         Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You 
                         didn't want to drink my milkshake. 
                         So what -- right?

                         Dr. Show on the issue.

               Charlie and Harriet are watching the news show. DOCTOR SHOW 
               is patched in via the Anchorman's close circuit TV.

                              (ON TV)
                         Doctor, is it possible that one could 
                         be poisoned with no trace at all?

                                     DOCTOR SHOW
                              (ON TV)
                         Certainly. There are plants that 
                         grow very commonly in our own backyard 
                         that could easily be fermented into 
                         poison. Take for instance the...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (getting nervous; 
                              blocking out TV)
                         Harriet, why don't we shut the light 
                         off.

                                     NEWS ANCHORMAN
                              (ON TV)
                         Really? And how easy it that to do?

                              (ON TV)
                         Scarily enough, quite simple. You 
                         merely take the...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (blocking out the TV 
                              again)
                         Maybe we should turn the light back 
                         on. Yeah that's better.

                                     HARRIET
                         Charlie, what's the matter?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nothing.

                                     HARRIET
                         Charlie...

                         Well, it's just...
                              (re: the TV)
                         The TV. You can't even watch the 
                         news these days without getting 
                         depressed.

                                     HARRIET
                         I know, Charlie. And it's not just 
                         that. Look at the things people are 
                         doing. Partners killing each other... 
                         I mean, you hear a story like that, 
                         and... who can you really trust these 
                         days?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you mean?

                                     HARRIET
                         It's like, have you ever stood with 
                         someone at the edge of a cliff, or 
                         the edge of a subway platform, and 
                         you think, just for a split second, 
                         "What if I pushed him?"

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, I don't really take the subway 
                         ever, so...

               Charlie turns over on his side, she cuddles up behind him.

                                     HARRIET
                         I'm just making a point of how many 
                         times we trust people with our lives. 
                         I mean, look at us. If you didn't 
                         trust me, you would never be able to 
                         fall asleep.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why do you say that?

                                     HARRIET
                         Look at you, you're sleeping. Look 
                         how vulnerable you are. I mean, I 
                         could do anything at that point.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (nervous)
                         What could you do?

                              (sweet and innocent)
                         Anything. You're lying on your side, 
                         asleep, I could... stick a needle in 
                         your ear.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (grabbing his ear at 
                              the thought)
                         Aahhh!

                                     HARRIET
                         I'm just making a point of what a 
                         good relationship we have. Goodnight, 
                         sweetheart.

               He looks very uneasy. She kisses him and shuts off the light. 
               The moon gives the room an eerie glow.

                                     HARRIET
                         Well, good night.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Good night.

               She doesn't close her eyes. He's scared to close his. Pause.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well... good night.

                                     HARRIET
                              (smiling)
                         Good night.

               They both look over at each other. She closes her eyes. He 
               takes a deep breath and then closes his eyes.

               And covers his ear with his hand.

               INT. BART PLATFORM - DAY

               Charlie is on the crowded platform. Next to him is an old 
               lady with a lot of shopping bags. Three kids on skateboards 
               whiz by and accidentally knock bags out of her hands. Cat 
               toys and cans of cat food go everywhere. Charlie bends down 
               and starts to help her gather her stuff.

                                     LADY
                         Thank you very much, young man. I've 
                         gotta get all this stuff back to my 
                         children.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Your children?

                                     LADY
                         When I say my children I mean my 
                         cats. You see my children moved out 
                         years ago, so all I've got is my 
                         cats. I have over one hundred of 
                         them.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's a lot of cats.

                                     HARRIET (O.S.)
                         Charlie.

               Charlie looks up and sees Harriet waving to him from the 
               subway stairs. He waves back and motions. "I'll be there in 
               a second", and continues to help the old lady. She watches 
               from the stairs.

                                     LADY
                         You see this red toy? That's for the 
                         Captain, he's finicky. and this blue 
                         one? That's for Marco Polo.

               Two train headlights are seen off in the distance.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Do you have a name for all of your 
                         cats?

                                     LADY
                         Oh, yes.

               Charlie glances over at Harriet, who slowly makes her way 
               down the platform towards him.

                                     LADY
                         Let me see! There's Winston Churchill, 
                         Reda Sovine, Thomas Edison, Andrew 
                         Carnegie...

               The train is getting closer and closer, and so is Harriet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         ...He was Scottish.

               Harriet moves forward a step, Charlie moves back a step.

                                     LADY
                         Wasn't he Irish?

               As Harriet seems to get closer Charlie continues to back up, 
               picking up cat toys. Charlie realizes he has no where else 
               to turn. so he side steps down the platform, never stopping 
               his conversation with the lady.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Actually he was Scottish. Trust me, 
                         I know these things.

               Harriet is moving in on him. Charlie steadily makes his way 
               down the platform, feigning accidentally kicking cat food 
               down the platform. The old lady is unsure what is going on, 
               she tries to keep up with him.

                                     LADY
                         Now that you say it, he was Scotch.

               Charlie runs out of platform. Harriet is very close to him. 
               The train is closer, so is Harriet. Charlie lets out a scream.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Noooooo!

               Charlie is standing at the edge of the platform, Harriet is 
               a good six or seven feet away as the train passes by. Charlie 
               is safe. People are all staring at Charlie curiously, 
               including Harriet and the old lady. Charlie is embarrassed.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (embarrassed)
                         Nooooooo, Scotch is a drink. Scots 
                         are a people. Sorry, that just always 
                         bugged me.

               No one knows what is going on.

                                     LADY
                         I'm sorry, I didn't know it meant so 
                         much to you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi, Harriet.

               EXT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE BUILDING - DAY

               INT. CHRONICLE ANNOUNCEMENTS DESK.

               WE SEE A LONG DESK WITH DIFFERENT SIGNS THAT READ; BIRTHS, 
               DEATHS, AND MARRIAGES.

               We find Charlie at the marriage counter.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Yes, Sir, can I help you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'd like to put in an announcement 
                         of my parents forty-fifth wedding 
                         anniversary.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Sure, it's $4.50 per word, and you've 
                         got a choice of standard or bold.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Bold, and here, I've written it out.

               Charlie looks over to the deaths counter. He overhears two 
               obituary assistants having a conversation.

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                         Hi, Frank, busy week?

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2
                         I've only got two. It's dead around 
                         here.

               Both assistants laugh. Charlie is mildly bemused.

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2
                         Well, I've got this one guy, a 
                         tourist. He had a heart attack on a 
                         cable car.

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                         Looks like he left his heart in San 
                         Francisco.

                                     MARRIAGE ASSISTANT
                         Hey, that's a real person you're 
                         talking about.

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                         You're right, I'm sorry.

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2
                         Well, there's this other guy Elliot, 
                         Ralph. Plumber, disappeared four 
                         months ago. Body found in a sewer.
                              (pause)

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                              (despite himself)
                         I guess he took his work too 
                         seriously, and his life went down 
                         the drain.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did they mention anything about his 
                         wife?

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                              (crest fallen)
                         You're right, I feel bad. Point taken. 
                         I'm mean, these are real people we're 
                         talking about.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, I'm serious. Did he mention the 
                         wife?

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                         You made your point. I was wrong to 
                         make a joke about a person's life.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I really want to know about his wife.

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                              (crying and shouting)
                         O.K., you win. I'm a bad, bad person.

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #2
                         Frank take it easy.

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                         No, he's right!
                              (pounding his head 
                              with his fists)
                         I'm for shit, I'm one insensitive 
                         asshole.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is there any mention of the wife? At 
                         all?

                                     OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
                         NO! THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE WIFE! 
                         YOU HAPPY!?

               Charlie exits.

               EXT. CHRONICLE ANNOUNCEMENT OFFICE - DAY

               Charlie stands outside the announcement office, terrified.

               INT. MEATS OF THE WORLD

               Harriet is talking to a CUSTOMER.

                                     HARRIET
                         Hi.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sorry.
                              (beat)
                         I think you're a terrific woman.
                              (beat)
                         I just don't think we should see 
                         each other anymore.

               She moves around to Charlie. She lifts his chin so that he 
               is looking directly into her eyes.

                                     HARRIET
                         Why not? And tell me the truth.

                                     CHARLIE
                         The truth. Okay. The truth is...

               She is so close to him, and so very beautiful, it's 
               distracting.

                                     CHARLIE
                         The truth is... I'm afraid that you 
                         are...
                              (he can't)
                         You're going to laugh.

                                     HARRIET
                         I don't think so.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay... the truth is that I'm afraid 
                         you're going to ki... leave me.

                                     HARRIET
                         I'm going to "cleave you?" What does 
                         that mean?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Leave me. Not "cleave me." Reject 
                         me. And so I decided to take matters 
                         into my own hands and get it over 
                         with by...

                                     HARRIET
                         Rejecting me.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (he feels awful)
                         Purely preventive... It's not anything 
                         you've done.

                                     HARRIET
                         I know that... So why are you leaving 
                         me?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (heartbroken)
                         Harriet, maybe I'm not meant to be 
                         in a relationship.

               A single tear runs down her cheek. She brushes it away 
               quickly.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I never wanted to hurt you.

                                     HARRIET
                         You haven't. At least you left early 
                         on.
                              (she's crying)
                         So, that's it, then. I've got a lot 
                         of work to do.
                              (to Customer)
                         Now, where were we?

               Charlie goes.

               INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

               Charlie lies on the bar head down. Tony rushes in, looks 
               around and sees Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (without lifting head)
                         Two hours and four minutes. Tony, I 
                         need you, and two hours and four 
                         minutes later you show up.

                                     TONY
                         Sorry. I know it was irresponsible 
                         to stay at the drug bust until it 
                         was over, but... What happened?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (slowly sitting up)
                         I'm gonna tell you, but when I do, 
                         just say nothing. Don't judge me. 
                         Just be my friend. Okay?

                                     TONY
                         Fine. Okay.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I broke up with Harriet.

                                     TONY
                         You're an asshole.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's your point?

                                     TONY
                         I'm sorry, I just... why?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tony, she's a killer. The... 
                         everything.

                                     TONY
                         But nothing's proven. The only thing 
                         you're actually sure she did so far 
                         is she's treated you like a King.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I dunno, Tony, I just...

                                     TONY
                         Besides, everyone has something going 
                         on with them. I mean, you can't find 
                         everything in one person. I mean, 
                         she's bright, she's funny, she's 
                         independent. So maybe, and it's really 
                         just a maybe, she kills her husbands. 
                         Marriage is give and take, Man. You 
                         take the good with the bad.

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

               Charlie lies in bed. He's writing in his journal. He stares 
               out into space. Inspired, he writes...

               THIS POEM SUCKS

               His hand reaches across and scratches it out.

               EXT. HAIGHT-ASHBURY STREET - DAY

               Charlie is exiting a vintage record store. Suddenly he finds 
               himself face to face with Sherri. She's accompanied by a 
               handsome young man.

                                     SHERRI
                         Hey, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi. How're you doing.
                              (he glances at her 
                              friend)
                         Good, huh?

                                     SHERRI
                         I'm okay. This is Michael. Michael, 
                         this is Charlie MacKenzie.

                                     YOUNG GUY
                         I know. Why don't you two talk. I'm 
                         going over there to buy some 
                         magazines.

               He walks over to a magazine stand.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That good looking and he can read!

                                     SHERRI
                         I'm teaching him. I heard you have a 
                         new girlfriend.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We broke up. There were problems.

                                     SHERRI
                         Problems?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Difficulties.

                                     SHERRI
                         Let me guess...
                              (smiles)
                         She's a murderer.

               For a moment, Charlie is too stunned to respond. Then...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why did you just say that?

                                     SHERRI
                              (laughs)
                         What else is left?

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

               He's on the Stair Master, stepping very lethargically. The 
               TELEPHONE RINGS: He goes to answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello...

                                     TONY
                              (through phone)
                         Not that it matters anymore, but I 
                         thought you should know -- someone 
                         just turned themselves in for the 
                         murder of Ralph Elliot.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Really? Did she confess to the other 
                         murders?

                                     TONY
                         Just the plumber so far, but she'll 
                         come along.
                              (after a pause)
                         A little old lady from Pacific 
                         Heights. Said he overcharged her on 
                         a leaking sink.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Really. Leaky sink, huh?

                                     TONY
                         Anyway, crime to stop. Gotta go. 
                         I'll catch you later.

               Tony hangs up. Charlie stops pedaling on the bike. Now he 
               really feels like shit. Harriet's not a killer. Sherri's not 
               a cheater.

               He races out of the bedroom.

               Moments later he appears, puts on a pair of pants over his 
               exercise shorts, then races out the door again.

               EXT./INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - EARLY EVENING

               Charlie races along towards Harriet's house.

               EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT DOOR - DAY

               He races up to the door and starts to bang and knock and 
               ring...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (through door)
                         Harriet, it's me, Charlie.

                                     HARRIET (O.S.)
                         Go away, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I've gotta talk to you, cause I miss 
                         you, and I made a mistake... and if 
                         you give me another chance I'll 
                         change. I will. I promise. I'll get 
                         help, or therapy, or... Yeah, that'll 
                         be great. Therapy. Even twice a week. 
                         I'll check with my insurance to see 
                         if I'm covered, but forget that. 
                         Harriet...

               The chain opens on the door.

                                     HARRIET
                         You really hurt me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll make it up to you, can we at 
                         least talk.

                                     HARRIET
                         Sure, talk.

               Rose steps up behind Charlie.

                                     ROSE (O.S.)
                         Hi, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         AAAhhhhhh.

                                     ROSE
                              (as she now proceeds 
                              to be let in by 
                              Harriet)
                         Trust your first instincts, Charlie. 
                         You never do. It's your big mistake. 
                         That and the haircut.

               Once again, baffled by Rose, Charlie touches his hair, shakes 
               it off and looks Harriet right in the eye.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't want to lose you.

                                     HARRIET
                         You didn't lose me. You rejected me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm unrejecting you.

                                     HARRIET
                         How do I know you won't reject me 
                         again?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I love you.

                                     HARRIET
                              (after a long pause)
                         I love you. But you blew it, Charlie, 
                         you blew it.

               She goes into the house. Charlie stands there dejected. He 
               knows he's blown it.

               INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Harriet is doing a load of laundry consisting of bloodied 
               work clothes. Suddenly she can hear the sound of MUSIC, very 
               loudly.

               Annoyed, she goes out her front door to tell her neighbors 
               off. Just as she's about to knock on the door, she realizes 
               it's not the source of the music. At that moment her neighbor, 
               who is a STEWARDESS, comes out in nightclothes.

                                     STEWARDESS
                         I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm a 
                         stewardess, and I have an early flight 
                         out in the morning. Can you please 
                         keep your music down?

                                     HARRIET
                         I thought it was coming from here.

                                     STEWARDESS
                         But someone keeps shouting your name 
                         over and over.

               Puzzled, Harriet rushes back to her own balcony.

               EXT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT

               Harriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the 
               noise. Charlie serenades Harriet in the street below, 
               accompanied by a TRUMPETER with a MUTE, a DOUBLE BASS PLAYER 
               AND A GUY ON A SNARE.

                                     CHARLIE
                         HARRIET, HARRIET HARD-HEARTED

                         THE NIGHT AIR LIKE A FIREMAN GOING 
                         TO A WINDOW THAT HAS NO FIRE EXCEPT 
                         THE PASSION OF HIS HEART 
                         I AM LONELY,
                         IT'S REALLY HARD
                         THIS POEM SUCKS

               A crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on 
               their balconies. They break out into APPLAUSE. Charlie proudly 
               takes the applause and bows to Harriet. She throws him a 
               flower. He's won her back.

               INT. BATHTUB - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Romantic with candles surrounding the tub. Harriet and Charlie 
               are bathing together. Wherever one of them moves, the water 
               extinguishes a candle and Charlie lights it. This is keeping 
               him pretty busy.

                                     HARRIET
                         I've been there for almost a year. I 
                         only planned on stay with her for a 
                         few weeks, but she gets upset every 
                         time I say I'm moving.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You were close as kids?

                                     HARRIET
                         I pretty much raised her. You know 
                         the scene. Depressed mother... 
                         withdrawn father.

                         My dad was a photographer too.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Really?

                                     HARRIET
                         He hated it. Trudging off to those 
                         weddings every Saturday night. Other 
                         people's celebrations he called it. 
                         He said sometimes they didn't even 
                         offer him a glass of soda. He had a 
                         small studio, and every year at 
                         Christmas he'd take a picture of me 
                         and Rose and put it in the window on 
                         a little card that said "Seasons 
                         Greetings." Awful pictures. It's 
                         like... I could see his pain in my 
                         face. Anyway, me and my sister worked 
                         with our "childhood issues" in 
                         different ways. She became a 
                         photographer and I became phobic 
                         about having my picture taken. It's 
                         quite a family.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Where are they now? Your parents?

                                     HARRIET
                         Dead. Car accident.

               There is a RING at the door.

                                     ROSE (O.S.)
                         Harriet, its for you.

               INT. HARRIET'S LIVING ROOM

               Charlie comes out of the bathroom in a robe.

                                     HARRIET
                         Charlie, I want you to meet a friend 
                         of mine. Say hi to Ralph.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (shocked)
                         Ralph?

               A plain looking lady in her thirties, RALPH, is sitting by 
               the window.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (delighted)
                         Oh, like Ralph, the lady carpenter 
                         in Green Acres!

                                     HARRIET
                         This is Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I love you!

                                     RALPH
                         It's nice to meet you.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (ecstatic)
                         Nice? It's more than nice. It's great 
                         to meet you. It's fantastic to meet 
                         you. I just, I can't tell you how 
                         glad I am. Ralph. Really. I am.

                                     RALPH
                         Well, thank you, I've heard a lot of 
                         nice things about you too, and...

               He rushes over to hug her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, Ralphie, I love you.

               Swept up in his enthusiasm his towel falls off. Harriet is 
               shocked, but amused.

                                     HARRIET
                         I'll leave you guys alone. Have a 
                         great time.

               Charlie realizes he is naked. His arms are still wrapped 
               around Ralph.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm naked, aren't I?

                                     HARRIET
                         Why, yes, you are.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I should really get dressed now.

               He hurriedly puts his towel back on, bolts to the bedroom 
               door. Just before he enters, he pauses and turns to Ralph.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Ralph)
                         Call me.

               He leaves.

                                     RALPH
                              (to Harriet; a little 
                              confused)
                         Friendly guy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A KITCHEN DOOR OPENS...

               and Charlie's mother, MAY, shoulders her way through the 
               door, carrying a HAPPY ANNIVERSARY CAKE with a big 45 written 
               on it.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE IN:

               INT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

               May and Stuart's 45 year anniversary party. UNCLE ANGUS is 
               at the piano playing "Happy Anniversary" as Charlie's parents, 
               all their friends and Harriet all sit around the piano 
               SINGING:

                                     THE GROUP
                         Happy Anniversary to you...
                              (Etc.)

               The song ends. May and Stuart blow out the candles.

                                     MAY
                         Okay, everyone come and get a piece 
                         of cake and some milk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey Dad, I got an anniversary present 
                         for you...

               Stuart looks up, and Charlie gets him in a headlock and pins 
               him to the ground.

                                     STUART
                         I'm proud of you, son. I'm proud of 
                         you.
                              (Stuart addresses the 
                              group)
                         I just wanna propose a toast. To my 
                         wife. Forty five years ago today May 
                         and I got married. Some of you were 
                         there, some of you weren't born yet, 
                         some of you are now dead, but... We 
                         both said, "I do" and we haven't 
                         agreed on a single thing since. But, 
                         I'm glad I married you May cause... 
                         It could have been worse and 
                         besides... I still love you.

               They kiss and everyone APPLAUDS. Uncle Angus breaks into, 
               "Stand By Your Man." May and Stuart start to dance. Charlie 
               looks at another young couple who are touched by this sincere 
               display of love. He looks over at Harriet. Stuart and May 
               feed each other cake. Charlie approaches Harriet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Harriet, I wanna talk to you.

                                     HARRIET
                         Boy, you really made some impression 
                         with Ralph. She can't get over you.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (stalling; nervous)
                         I'm just so happy for you to have 
                         friends like Ralph. What a great 
                         friend to have.

                                     HARRIET
                         Is everything all right, Charlie? 
                         You're perspiring.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Harriet... marry me.

                                     HARRIET
                         What?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I want to have a wedding. With you.

                                     HARRIET
                         No.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Please.

                                     HARRIET
                         I don't know, Charlie. It's so good 
                         like it is. Why don't we just live 
                         together first?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Because, I love you and I want you 
                         to marry me and be with me for 45 
                         years. I want you to have my children, 
                         and I want to have your children. I 
                         know that sounds like a lot of 
                         children, and they might not all get 
                         along, but... I'm finally ready to 
                         trust you and to make a commitment. 
                         Marry me, Harriet, please. Be my 
                         wife.

               Harriet flinches slightly at the word "Wife", but Charlie is 
               too wrapped up in the moment to notice. Stuart addresses the 
               group.

                                     STUART
                         I'd like to thank Charlie for throwing 
                         us this party. I hope some day you 
                         have the same great 45 years that 
                         we've had.

               People clap and smile. Harriet looks at Charlie. He has tears 
               in his eyes.

                                     HARRIET
                         Yes.

               At first it doesn't register. Then...

                                     CHARLIE
                         You will?

               She smiles.

                                     HARRIET
                         Let's get married, Charlie.

               They kiss.

                                     MAY
                              (from across room)
                         Harriet, come here a minute. I want 
                         you and Uncle Angus to play a song 
                         together.

               Harriet and Charlie kiss one last time and she goes to the 
               piano.

               Charlie stays in the corner, and Tony comes over.

                                     TONY
                         Hey, sorry I'm so late. What's 
                         happening?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nothing. Nothing at all. Just two 
                         little things...
                              (as Tony looks in)
                         That woman over there in the corner... 
                         She's Harriet's friend, and her name 
                         is Ralph.

                                     TONY
                         No shit.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And secondly... That woman over 
                         there...
                              (Re: Harriet)
                         That's Harriet, and we're getting 
                         married.

                                     TONY
                              (excited)
                         Fantastic... What did I tell you. 
                         She's a great girl. And the last 
                         thing in the world she'd be is a 
                         murderer.

               And then Harriet begins singing at the piano.

                                     HARRIET
                              (singing)
                         ONLY YOU...
                         CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT...
                         ONLY YOU...
                         CAN MAKE THIS DARKNESS LIGHT..."

               Tony and Charlie look at each other. "Only you?" Then Charlie 
               looks at his bride with confidence.

               He walks over and joins her. She sings to him. It's a moment.

               INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

               Charlie and Harriet pick out a diamond ring.

               INT. TRAVEL AGENCY

               Charlie and Harriet point to brochures of the different cities 
               they could go to on their honeymoon. They decide on a picture 
               of the "DRY CREEK LODGE" in Oregon.

               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

               They are getting their blood tests back. Harriet looks at 
               hers, casually. Charlie is nervous. Reluctantly he opens the 
               file and looks at it. He is pleased with the results and 
               does a victory dance.

               EXT. SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - ESTABLISHING

               INT. SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

               Charlie and Harriet are being married. Harriet is in a 
               beautiful wedding gown. Charlie is wearing a kilt. Tony is 
               the best man. He also wears a kilt. Stuart, also kilted, 
               May, the whole family along with a hundred well-wishers are 
               in attendance. The SCOTTISH MINISTER presides. Rose is in a 
               kilt.

                                     SCOTTISH MINISTER
                         Now, Mr. MacKenzie, if you will take 
                         this woman to be your wife, through 
                         thick and thin, for better or for 
                         worse, please say: "I do"...

                                     CHARLIE
                         I do...

                                     SCOTTISH MINISTER
                         Now Harriet, if you will take this 
                         man, through good times and bad, for 
                         ever and ever, as your husband, please 
                         say "I Do"...

               Harriet starts to speak; but right before the words come 
               out, she stares into Charlie's eyes and STOPS. Charlie looks 
               nervous. So does the Scottish Minister. So does Tony. So 
               does everyone.

                                     HARRIET
                              (after a long pause; 
                              finally:)
                         I do.

                                     SCOTTISH MINISTER
                         Now Charlie... Kiss the beautiful 
                         bride!

               Charlie and Harriet kiss. We can see (though Charlie can't) 
               Harriet has a strange unsure expression on her face. Tony 
               notices it though and can't figure it out.

                                     STUART
                         Let's get pissed.

               The wedding march kicks in being played by a drunken Scotsman 
               on BAGPIPES.

               INT. RECEPTION HALL

               A Scottish accordionist and a Drummer play SCOTLAND THE BRAVE. 
               Some OLDER SCOTTISH AUNTIES are CLAPPING and HOOTING LOUDLY 
               along with the tune. Some young girl COUSINS in traditional 
               Scottish costume, dance the sword dance along to SCOTLAND 
               THE BRAVE.

               We pass the buffet which we see is catered by "Meats Of The 
               World." Then we pass a very drunken Stuart in a heated 
               discussion with four other people.

                                     STUART
                         You know Golden Gate park was designed 
                         by a Scotsman, MacClaren, which is 
                         who MacClaren park was named after.

               The others agree heartily.

               May and Tony are dancing. May is dancing uncomfortably close. 
               She keeps sliding her hand down to his ass, which he then 
               has to move back to his shoulder.

               Then we come to William, who's reluctantly at the children's 
               table. All his little cousins are queuing up for a chance to 
               feel his head.

               We find Charlie in a corner. One of the hooting Scottish 
               aunties is trying to get him to have another Scotch.

                                     AUNTIE MOLLY
                              (proffering the Scotch)
                         Charlie, get this down your neck.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Auntie Molly if I have another one 
                         I'll end up underneath the table 
                         with my kilt over my head.

               Tony joins them.

                                     TONY
                         Where's Harriet?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know. Oh, there she is.

               She's in the corner by herself looking weird and ominous. 
               She has enough food in front or her for three people.

               She eats ravenously and incessantly. Charlie goes over to 
               her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         A little hungry, were you?

               At that moment, a FLASH goes off. Harriet looks up angrily.

                                     HARRIET
                         What are you...!

               Then she realizes it's Rose. She calms down and smiles. 
               Charlie looks at her, a little peculiarly, but Harriet regains 
               her composure.

                                     HARRIET
                         Sorry. The flash just...

               The band kicks into a new dance. A YOUNG BOY comes up to the 
               bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his 
               ear. The bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and 
               then breaks into Rod Stewart's "IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY." From 
               across the room we hear Stuart singing.

                                     STUART
                              (full volume; singing)
                         IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY...
                         AND YOU WANT MY BODY...
                         COME ON BABY LET ME KNOW.

               Stuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up. The young people in 
               the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests 
               start getting into the swing of things. The bagpipe man 
               continues playing. It is clear that he is far too drunk to 
               play. He slowly keels over, drunk. And as he falls over face 
               first, he lands on his Bagpipes. The bagpipes let out an 
               ATONAL DEFLATING SOUND like the last dying throes of a 
               tortured animal. The BAGPIPE WAIL extends into the next scene.

               EXT. HIGH ABOVE COAST - DAY

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         Wait 'til you see this place, Harriet.

               INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - DAY

               They drive along the beautiful coast. Harriet is still eating. 
               They're listening to TEENAGE FAN CLUB.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Teenage Fan Club. They're 
                         from Scotland.

                                     HARRIET
                         They're great.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We'll have the whole lodge to 
                         ourselves practically.

                                     HARRIET
                         I can't wait, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I wish you could be me, so you could 
                         know how great it feels to be with 
                         you.

                                     HARRIET
                         It sounds wonderful

                                     CHARLIE
                         Do you think that would be a good 
                         line for a poem?

                                     HARRIET
                         Honestly? It sounds a little Hallmark.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft. 
                         I have a habit of sabotaging 
                         relationships, and there were a 
                         million times during me and you that 
                         I could have blown this, and I just 
                         thank God that I didn't...

               INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

               Tony is at his desk. The captain kicks open the door, knocking 
               Tony's feet off the desk. The captain is now dressed in 
               suspenders, a loosened tie, and a shirt with pit stains.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         O.K., Spiletti, I got word from 
                         upstairs that you been pokin' your 
                         nose into that Ralph Elliot case.

                                     TONY
                         Yes, Captain.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Don't "yes, Captain" me, Spiletti. 
                         You're outta line. This is strictly 
                         homicide.

                                     TONY
                         Captain, I got this friend...

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Friend? Yeah, we all got friends, 
                         Spiletti. I'm warning you, Stay away 
                         from this one. Back off, Italian 
                         boy. You're getting too close to 
                         this one.

                                     TONY
                         Captain, I know what I'm doing. Trust 
                         me. What's the news.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I can't believe I'm doing this, but 
                         that girl who confused to Ralph 
                         Elliot's murder also confessed to 
                         other murders.

                                     TONY
                         I knew she would! I knew it!

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yeah, apparently she also confessed 
                         to killing Abe Lincoln, Julius Caesar, 
                         and Warren G. Harding. She's a nut, 
                         Spiletti!

                                     TONY
                              (getting up)
                         Oh, my god! I gotta go!

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yeah, screw this one up Spiletti and 
                         you'll be writing parking tickets 
                         for the rest of your days.

                                     TONY
                         I won't let you down, Captain.

               Tony exits for a beat, then pokes his head in the doorway.

                                     TONY
                         That's much better Captain.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (nice again)
                         You think so? Well, thank you very 
                         much.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

               Tony hurries to his car.

               EXT. GAS STATION ALONG THE COAST - DAY

               They stop at a gas station with a small mini-mart. As Charlie 
               is filling the tank he notices Harriet slipping the key out 
               of the ignition before she walks to the mini-mart for more 
               food.

                                     HARRIET
                         You want anything?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lamb chops, creamed spinach, stuffed 
                         tomatoes and a Hershey Bar.

               Harriet arrives at the little Ma and Pa type mini-mart and 
               smiles to Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         If they don't have all that, I'll 
                         just take the Hershey bar.

               EXT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Tony stands at the door, buzzing the buzzer to no response.

               INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - EARLY EVENING

               They are still driving along the coast. Charlie is eating 
               his Hershey Bar. Harriet's eyes are becoming a bit glazed 
               now, her movements a little static. She keeps looking behind 
               them and out the window.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you keep looking behind us 
                         for?
                              (joking)
                         Is someone following you, or...?

                                     HARRIET
                         They were. I think they're gone.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (curious; pausing)
                         What do you mean, they were?

                                     HARRIET
                         The gas station guy. I thought he 
                         was chasing us for a while, but I 
                         guess he stopped.

                                     CHARLIE
                         The gas station guy? Why would the 
                         gas station guy chase us.

                                     HARRIET
                         I don't know, Charlie. I guess for 
                         not paying.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you mean not paying? You 
                         didn't pay him for the gas.

                                     HARRIET
                         I forgot to pay... I didn't want to 
                         be away from you for any longer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         So, you just left.

                                     HARRIET
                         Yes. And you're an accomplice.

               He stops mid-bite on his Hershey Bar. He's confused.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm not sure I understand.

                                     HARRIET
                         Look, Charlie, don't you get it? 
                         We're a team.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (going with it)
                         I can play that game. I'll get the 
                         next gas station. Like Bonnie & Clyde.

               He and Bonnie continue on the winding road and pass a sign 
               that reads: "DRY CREEK LODGE - 40 MILES"

               INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Tony knocks. No answer. He picks the lock and enters.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Rose is tied up and lying in a pool of blood. Tony stops for 
               a beat, draws his gun and slowly walks over to her. Just as 
               he gets there, a SHUTTER CLICKS.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, hi!

                                     TONY
                              (practically hysterical)
                         What is it with the women in your 
                         family?

                                     ROSE
                         I was just doing a murder series in 
                         honor of the wedding.

                                     TONY
                         Hey, this is real blood.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes, Harriet, give it to me. She's a 
                         butcher.
                              (Tony reacts)
                         ...She owns a butcher shop.

                                     TONY
                         I need a picture of Harriet.

                                     ROSE
                         Sorry. No can do.

                                     TONY
                         You took a picture at the party. I 
                         saw it.

                                     ROSE
                         It didn't come out.

                                     TONY
                         Look, Rose. I need a photo.

                                     ROSE
                         The picture didn't come out.
                              (he waits)
                         It was unflattering. In made her 
                         look ten pounds heavier.
                              (he waits)
                         She's my sister.

                                     TONY
                         She's been implicated in a crime. I 
                         need the photo to eliminate her as a 
                         suspect.

                                     ROSE
                         And if she's not innocent. If she's, 
                         you know, "quirky?"

                                     TONY
                         If she's "quirky" we'll save Charlie's 
                         life.

               Rose pulls out a photograph -- Charlie and Harriet. Looking 
               young and in love.

               EXT. DRY CREEK LODGE - LATE IN THE DAY

               A beautiful old Colonial Mansion, nestled in the mountains 
               and forests of the North-West. Romantic and from another 
               day. Charlie and Harriet pull up in front of it.

               The Valets open the door for them.

                                     HARRIET
                         It's like a castle, Charlie. It's so 
                         beautiful.

                                     VALET
                         Welcome to the Dry Creek. You just 
                         beat the rainstorm. Two hours later 
                         and the roads'd probably be closed.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Great. If you could help us with the 
                         luggage, we have these two in the 
                         back seat and...

               As they deal with the luggage, Harriet starts to walk away 
               from the hotel, away from the car, rain falling on her head. 
               She walks straight at the CAMERA, so only we can see her 
               expression. Her expression is one of simply "losing it".

                                     CHARLIE
                         Harriet? What are you doing honey?

               Harriet turns around and smiles at Charlie. He smiles back.

               INT. LOBBY OF DRY CREEK LODGE - EVENING

               Charlie and Harriet stand at the desk. Harriet is not quite 
               paying attention. Her attention span has slipped to none. 
               She's fidgety. She looks around suspiciously at everything 
               and everyone.

                                     DESK CLERK
                         Welcome, Sir. We have you with us 
                         for four nights, Mr. MacKenzie. Dinner 
                         reservations are at eight-thirty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Great. Sounds terrific.

                                     DESK CLERK
                         Also, you might wanna prepare some 
                         candles by the bed. We're expecting 
                         the rainstorm to get even worse. We 
                         might even lose the power tonight.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did you hear that, Harriet? A storm. 
                         I can't think of anything more 
                         romantic than the two of us trapped 
                         in our room in the middle of a rain 
                         storm.
                              (noticing her)
                         You okay, Harriet?

                                     HARRIET
                         Just a little head-ache.
                              (to clerk)
                         Excuse me, is there a drug store in 
                         the hotel? I want to get some aspirin.

                                     DESK CLERK
                         Right beyond those trees, Ma'm. 
                         Anything you need.

                                     HARRIET
                         Thanks. Don't go anywhere. I'll be 
                         right back.

               Harriet walks off to the lobby store, backwards, looking at 
               Charlie. Charlie watches her walk off. The Desk Clerk sits 
               staring at Charlie.

                                     DESK CLERK
                         You think she's really got a head-
                         ache?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     DESK CLERK
                         Ah, nothing. Here's your key. You're 
                         in the Oak Room.

               Charlie looks back at the drug store, where Harriet is 
               shopping. She waves to him. Charlie looks back at the Desk 
               Clerk and grabs the key.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FAX OF THE PHOTO OF CHARLIE & HARRIET

               coming out of a fax machine.

               INT. WALTER'S PLUMBING - EARLY EVENING

               WALTER, the owner of the Plumbing store, dressed in overalls 
               takes the Fax out and then picks up the phone.

                                     WALTER
                         That's Ralph Elliot's wife, alright. 
                         She had shorter hair in those days.

               INT. MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO - NIGHT

               MASTER CHO, the new owner of the studio, dressed in a gee, 
               looks at the same fax.

                                     MASTER CHO
                              (into phone)
                         Mrs. Richter gain much weight since 
                         then, but it's definitely her.

               INT. THE LIZARD'S LOUNGE - ATLANTIC CITY

               RANDY ROMANO, the owner, talks into the phone, holding up 
               the faxed photo of Charlie and Harriet.

                                     RANDY
                         That's his little lollipop, alright. 
                         Boy he loved her. I'll tell you, she 
                         was a lot of fun. Smart. A doll face 
                         to boot.

               INT. TONY'S CUBICLE - NIGHT

               Tony is on the phone. Kathy, seen before at the police 
               station, stands with him.

                                     TONY
                         Circuits are out from the storm.

               Tony gets to the police station door and opens it. Kathy 
               follows him.

                                     TONY
                              (to Kathy)
                         Keep trying the hotel. Tell the chief 
                         I just chartered a plane up to Oregon.

               The Police Captain enters.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (points to his hair)
                         See that Spiletti -- A gray hair! 
                         Every day, Spiletti, I find another 
                         one. And that's all due to you. Get 
                         out there, and catch me some bad 
                         guys!

                                     TONY
                         Not now, Captain.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (nice again)
                         Sorry.

               Tony dashes out of the police station and into his car.

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               A beautiful suite, with a fireplace burning a big stack of 
               wood, with another stack next to it, with an AXE in it. Music 
               is playing softly on the stereo. And Charlie and Harriet 
               have just finished making love underneath the covers, 
               illuminated just by the light of the fireplace.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is the best honeymoon I could 
                         ever imagine, Harriet. If we had to 
                         pack and go home right now, I'd still 
                         think it was the greatest honeymoon 
                         ever.

               Harriet doesn't respond. Her head is turned from his.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Don't you agree, Harriet? Harriet?

               He pulls the sheets away from her face to see that she is 
               crying.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (wiping her tears)
                         What? What are you crying? What is 
                         it?

                                     HARRIET
                         It's nothing. It's just... I was 
                         just thinking... We're married now. 
                         And I always wanted to try and have 
                         kids, and...

                                     CHARLIE
                         So do I. Look, there's nothing more 
                         I'd like to do than have, kids, or...

                                     HARRIET
                         It's just, I get scared that certain 
                         things will happen, or...

                                     CHARLIE
                         What are you talking about? You're 
                         gonna be a great Mom. I know you 
                         will.

                                     HARRIET
                         It's not that, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What then?

                                     HARRIET
                         You're gonna laugh.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tell me. Of course I'm not gonna 
                         laugh. Kids is a big thing. It's 
                         hard. I'm sure I have the same fears.

                                     HARRIET
                         If we have kids, Charlie, things 
                         happen. Kids are healthy and fine, 
                         and some aren't, and I don't know if 
                         I could live with myself if I gave 
                         birth to a child with webbed feet.

               Charlie stops to think about this. Webbed feet?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Webbed feet?

                                     HARRIET
                         You're laughing.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, I'm not laughing.

                                     HARRIET
                         You think that's silly?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, no. That's a natural fear. I've 
                         thought about that fear.

                                     HARRIET
                         It really worries me, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (quite confused)
                         Well, look, they have, doctors -- I 
                         assume -- that deal, only with, webbed 
                         feet. And, God Forbid, and I'm talking 
                         strictly hypothetically, should that 
                         happen, we'll find one.

                                     HARRIET
                              (kissing him; happy 
                              now)
                         You're the greatest Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (confused, to say the 
                              least)
                         Thanks. We should get ready for 
                         dinner.

               EXT./INT. CHARTERED CESSNA - NIGHT

               A small plane flies through the clouds. It's just Tony and 
               DENNIS the pilot.

               Dennis never really realizes this is more than a sightseeing 
               tour, and constantly points out scenic points along the way.

                                     DENNIS
                         Out your left side, you can see the 
                         Sierra Nevada, which is the largest 
                         mountain range west of the Rockies...

                                     TONY
                         Great. Rockies. I don't care. Oregon. 
                         Move.

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM AT DRY CREEK LODGE - NIGHT

               Charlie is dressed very sharply in sport coat and tie. He 
               yells into the bathroom where we can see part of Harriet 
               from behind.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You almost ready? The first seating 
                         is in five minutes.

                                     HARRIET
                              (from other room)
                         I just wanna look good for you, 
                         Charlie. That's all.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm sure you look great. I'm sure 
                         you look...

               Harriet turns the corner, wearing a nice dress. Her hair 
               looks okay. She's wearing perfume. The only problem is, she 
               has two lines of mascara running down her cheeks. She's been 
               crying. Charlie looks curious.

                                     HARRIET
                         Do I look okay, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes. Well...

               Charlie points to his own eye.

                                     HARRIET
                         What's wrong?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nothing. You kind of look like Tammy 
                         Faye Baker right now.

               She looks in the mirror.

                                     HARRIET
                         Oh, yeah.

               She goes back into the bathroom.

               EXT. CESSNA - NIGHT

               The plane descends towards the runway. The rain comes down 
               hard.

                                     DENNIS (V.O.)
                         As we prepare to land, we can see 
                         off to our left Lake Shanony, which 
                         is...

                                     TONY (V.O.)
                         Just land. Don't worry about Lake 
                         Shanony. I don't give a shit about 
                         Lake Shanony.

               The plane touches down.

               EXT. DRY CREEK LODGE - NIGHT

               Rain pours fantastically on the gothic castle. Wind blows 
               hard.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         A toast to our new friends, Charlie 
                         and Harriet...

               INT. BEAUTIFUL FRENCH RESTAURANT IN HOTEL - NIGHT

               A beautiful dining room with a small dance floor. Charlie 
               sits at an intimate table for two with Harriet. A small band 
               plays in the b.g., as the BAND LEADER is making the toast. 
               The five or six other couples in the restaurant also hold up 
               their glass.

                                     BAND LEADER
                         ...we're honored to be here for this 
                         very special day in...

               The CONCIERGE at this point interrupts to bring Charlie a 
               TELEPHONE. Everyone stops and watches and waits.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         I'm sorry to interrupt, Sir. There's 
                         a phone call for you from town.
                              (Charlie takes phone)
                         They say it's quite urgent.

               The toast, as well as the entire room, stops -- almost like 
               an E.F. Hutton commercial, waiting for Charlie's phone call 
               to finish.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (curious)
                         Hello?

               INT. AIRPORT IN OREGON - EARLY EVENING

               Tony speaks into the phone frantically.

                                     TONY
                         Charlie, you okay?

               INTERCUT PHONE CALL

                                     CHARLIE
                         Great. Couldn't be better.

                                     TONY
                         Charlie, listen to me! It's her! 
                         Harriet is Mrs. X! She killed Ralph 
                         and the two other men!

               Charlie looks up across the table at Harriet who is completely 
               caught up in the event of seeing how long she can keep her 
               hand in the candle before it hurts.

               She puts it in, smiles then takes it out. She shakes her 
               hand, and repeats the process.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (talking softly)
                         Look, that's great -- it just so 
                         happens though, that I met...
                              (louder than he had 
                              hoped)
                         Ralph, and much to my delight, not 
                         only is she alive, but she's female. 
                         I thought I told you.

               Harriet looks at Charlie, very suspiciously. He looks back 
               at her, and tries to smile, pretending that he is having a 
               pleasant, and completely irrelevant conversation.

                                     TONY
                         Rose had a picture. It checked out. 
                         It's her, Charlie. She is the 
                         murderer.

                                     HARRIET
                         Charlie, your food is getting cold.

               Charlie waves "One Minute" to Harriet, as she watches.

                                     CHARLIE
                         So, what do I do?

                                     TONY
                         I called the police. All the roads 
                         are closed, but they're on their 
                         way. In the mean time just...

               The line goes DEAD.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello?
                              (pressing receiver)
                         Hello?

                                     HARRIET
                         What's a matter, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to concierge)
                         The phone just went dead. I was on 
                         the phone and it went dead.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         That's quite common, sir. I'm sure 
                         the lines'll be out in the whole 
                         city 'til tomorrow. Enjoy your meal, 
                         Sir.

               The Concierge takes the phone away. Charlie turns slowly to 
               Harriet, genuinely scared.

                                     HARRIET
                         What happened, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nothing... Nothing happened. Just 
                         the lines are down. Phone lines.

               Suddenly, the band leader continues with his toast.

                                     BAND LEADER
                              (over microphone)
                         ...so to these two young people, we 
                         wish them a long and happy life 
                         together and would like to play their 
                         song. The Platters -- "Only You".

               The band starts to play "Only You".

               People APPLAUD. Harriet and Charlie just stare at each other. 
               He knows.

               The older couple at the next table, MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN, 
               lean over to their table.

                                     MR. LEVENSTEIN
                         How about the traditional Bride & 
                         Groom dance?

               Another couple walks by and pulls them literally out of the 
               their seats and onto the dance floor.

                                     OTHER COUPLE
                         Come on. It's a tradition.

               Charlie finds himself in the middle of the dance floor dancing 
               slowly with Harriet. He's scared out of his mind. The music 
               plays in the background. Harriet smiles strangely at him. He 
               tries to smile back, checking all the Exits, planning an 
               escape.

               Then suddenly, call it luckily, MR. LEVENSTEIN, interrupts:

                                     MR. LEVENSTEIN
                         Excuse me. Could I cut in on your 
                         dance?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Of course. Sure...

               Charlie gives her hand away to Mr. Levenstein. He takes Mrs. 
               Levenstein's hand and starts to dance towards the EXIT, when 
               suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT. The MUSIC is out. The 
               LIGHTS ARE OUT.

               In the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered 
               moon outside, Charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting 
               for an exit to the outside.

               He arrives in someone's arms on his way.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I need your help! You have to help 
                         me! I've married a...!

               The LIGHTS GO BACK ON and Charlie is in HARRIET'S ARMS again. 
               Her face is near menacing now. She smiles a very disturbed 
               grin. He doesn't know what to say.

                                     HARRIET
                              (much too pleasant)
                         Hello, Charlie.

               Charlie and her are squared off. Neither speak. Suddenly 
               both of them are lifted into the air. They look down and see 
               the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing 
               them up in the air again and again. The MUSIC plays along 
               loudly.

               Harriet watches Charlie very closely, as Charlie looks scared. 
               Then, the people start to carry them out of the room and 
               down the hallway.

                                     WAITER
                         Let's take 'em to their room.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         Yeah, I'm sure they've had enough of 
                         these crowds for one night.

                                     CHARLIE
                         My dinner. I didn't finish my dinner 
                         yet.

                                     HARRIET
                         Smile, Charlie. Act like you're having 
                         a good time.

               The other hotel guests threw them inside. The room is all 
               made up, the sheets are pulled down, the firewood is cut, 
               the AXE is in the wood.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         Have a good night, you two.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Come on in. Stay for a nightcap.

                                     BELLBOY
                         No, you two wanna be alone. See you.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (demanding)
                         Stay for a nightcap!

                                     BELLBOY
                         Sir, I really don't think I should

                                     CHARLIE
                              (shouting)
                         STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!

               The bellboy is frightened and runs away.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (shouting down the 
                              hall after him)
                         STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!

               Harriet pulls Charlie back into the room, frightened that 
               he's leaving.

                                     HARRIET
                         Don't go, Charlie.

               EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               Tony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in 
               his forties who's just entered his four wheel drive jeep.

                                     TONY
                              (flashing his badge)
                         Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San 
                         Francisco Police Department. I'm on 
                         official business and I'm afraid I 
                         have to commandeer your vehicle.

                                     MAN
                              (unfazed)
                         No.

                                     TONY
                         What do you mean no?!

                                     MAN
                         I happen to know for a fact that you 
                         don't have the power to commandeer 
                         my vehicle.

                                     TONY
                         This is true.
                              (pause)
                         Please can I commandeer your vehicle?

                                     MAN
                         Well, where are you going?

                                     TONY
                         To The Dry Creek Lodge.

                                     MAN
                         I'll give you a lift.

                                     TONY
                         Well, I don't want a lift, I really 
                         want to commandeer the vehicle. Please 
                         just let me commandeer the vehicle.

                                     MAN
                         Why don't you just let me drive you 
                         there? Really, I don't mind, it's on 
                         my way.
                              (pause)

                                     TONY
                         You're not going to bend on the 
                         commandeering thing are you?

                                     MAN
                         No.

                                     TONY
                         Well, if we get stopped will you at 
                         least let me say that I commandeered 
                         the vehicle, but I let you drive?

                                     MAN
                         I'm uncomfortable with that.

                                     TONY
                         Please?

                                     MAN
                         All right.

               INT. CHARLES AND HARRIET'S ROOM

               Charlie & Harriet are all alone. The voices trail off down 
               the hallway until they disappear. Charlie and Harriet stare 
               at each other. Harriet blocks the door. Charlie looks around 
               the room. The Axe. The Corkscrew. The letter opener. The 
               fountain pen. At this point, everything in the room looks 
               like a potential weapon. Harriet takes the axe.

                                     HARRIET
                         I heard you on the phone before, 
                         Charlie. There's something I've got 
                         to tell you.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (frightened)
                         Harriet, I...

                                     HARRIET
                         I've been married before.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I already know.

                                     HARRIET
                         About my husbands?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes. And I was meaning to have a 
                         word with you. We could get an 
                         annulment.

                                     HARRIET
                              (screams)
                         AAAhhhhhhh!

               Suddenly the power goes off again. They're both in the dark. 
               A scuffle. Charlie has restrained Harriet, throws her in a 
               walk-in closet and locks it. From behind the door, we hear 
               Harriet WAILING. Which continues.

               Charlie picks up the axe, looks at it, relieved at his lucky 
               escape. He rushes to the door to escape. He opens it and 
               standing there is Rose.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be 
                         so glad to see you.

               Rose smiles. Charlie puts down the axe. The lights flicker 
               back on.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (going to the phone)
                         Maybe the phones are working again 
                         by now.

               He listens for a dial tone. Beside the phone he sees a note. 
               He starts to read is:

                                     CHARLIE
                         'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle 
                         the commitment. I'm leaving you.' 
                         Signed, 'Charlie.'

               And behind him Rose approaches with the axe raised.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell is this? I didn't write 
                         this?

               And at that moment he turns to find the AXE BEING FLUNG 
               THROUGH THE AIR AT his head. He ducks just in time.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the fuck?!

               She takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk 
               and the room is in complete DARKNESS.

                                     ROSE
                         Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet? 
                         I warned you not to marry her, didn't 
                         I? I warned all of them. But none of 
                         them listened to me. They all went 
                         ahead and married her. She's the 
                         pretty one. Where's Harriet? What 
                         have you done with my sister, Harriet?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nothing, Rose.

                                     ROSE
                         If you've done something to my sister, 
                         Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill 
                         you.

               We stay in Charlie's hip pocket as he tries to get away from 
               what he can't see. He stays very silent.

                                     HARRIET
                              (from the closet)
                         Where are you, Charlie? What's going 
                         on?

               Then Rose strikes a match. She lights a candle and comes 
               toward him. He looks around. The window is open. And Charlie 
               is gone.

               INT. COMMANDEERED CAR - NIGHT

               Tony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy, 
               winding road on the way up to the hotel. Tony is drumming on 
               the dash.

                                     MAN
                         Could you stop doing that please?

               EXT. CASTLE-LIKE ROUND TOWER/LEDGE OF TOWER - NIGHT

               Charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building. The storm 
               continues. Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase 
               him. He rounds the bend. Charlie looks into one room and 
               sees MR. & MRS. LEVENSTEIN there. There's loud OPERA MUSIC 
               playing in the room

                                     CHARLIE
                         Call the police!

               INT. THE LEVENSTEIN'S ROOM - NIGHT SAME

               The Levensteins prepare for bed. Charlie races by their 
               window. Then Rose races by.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Call the police!

               Mr. Levenstein closes the curtains. He can't hear.

               EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT

               Charlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at 
               several points. Rose then appears on the roof holding the 
               Axe, still.

                                     ROSE
                              (mostly to herself; 
                              slurring most words)
                         Charlie, did you like your note? I 
                         thought it was pretty accurate. I 
                         did all the husbands' notes. I can 
                         forge anyone's handwriting, I can 
                         write in anyone's style. See, I'm an 
                         artist. Harriet isn't an artist. 
                         Sure she could get a husband, but 
                         she could never have done this. And 
                         you know what I'm most proud of?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's that, Rose?

                                     ROSE
                         Harriet never knew. She thought they 
                         all just left her. I protected her. 
                         She's my sister.

               Charlie turns and runs. Rose chases him.

               INT. BEDROOM

               Tony breaks into the room with his gun drawn.

                                     TONY
                              (shouting)
                         Charlie!

                                     HARRIET
                              (from closet)
                         Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. 
                         I'm in here.

               Carefully, Tony opens the closet door.

                                     HARRIET
                         Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie. 
                         They're out on the ledge.

                                     TONY
                              (not believing)
                         Get on the floor and put your hands 
                         behind your back.

               Harriet willingly goes on the floor.

                                     HARRIET
                         Sure, anything. You've got to save 
                         Charlie.

               Tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window.

               INT. BEDROOM

               Tony is standing with his back to the window, between it and 
               Harriet. She looks out of the window and screams.

                                     HARRIET
                         Look! It's Charlie!

               From Harriet's POV we see Charlie on the ledge edging along. 
               He stops in horror when he sees Harriet, glances back to the 
               pursuing Rose, and rushes off.

               Tony looks behind him out the window. Nobody is there.

                                     TONY
                         Nice try.

                                     HARRIET
                         I swear to you... It was Charlie... 
                         Look! Now there's Rose!

               Rose looks into the room, with the axe in her hand.

                                     TONY
                         No you don't.

                                     HARRIET
                         I beg you... Look! It is Rose.

                                     TONY
                         Oh no, not again.
                              (he glances at the 
                              window)
                         Aaaaah! Rose.

               INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW

               There is opera music playing. Charlie rushes by, past the 
               window. There is a beat and he comes back, staring inside in 
               amazement.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Mr. Levenstein is in a Viking outfit. Mrs. Levenstein is in 
               full Norse Regalia.

               INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW

               Charlie gulps and rushes on, hastily pursued by Rose.

               INT. THE ROOF

               Rose pulls the Axe back and swings, and the momentum of the 
               swing pulls her feet out from under her, and on the slippery 
               icy roof she falls and starts to slide.

               Just as she's about to go off the fifty foot high roof, 
               Charlie climbs down the roof. He stands over her. She's about 
               to slip. Her hands are losing strength. Her fingers are 
               slipping. The rain is falling harder and harder.

               Charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for 
               life.

               He leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to her 
               hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips.

               She is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harder 
               and harder. Charlie now is nowhere near her. He then gets 
               down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the 
               side of the drainpipe to get her.

               Rose looks up helplessly at him. Not really asking for his 
               help. Not denying it. She's accepted her fate.

               Policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below in 
               bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself 
               hanging on for dear life.

               He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just as 
               he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below. 
               Charlie, then with all his strength -- his "where has this 
               strength been my whole life" strength -- pulls her up to the 
               roof next to him.

               Several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over 
               to where Charlie is detaining Rose. The police take her, 
               handcuff her and cart her away. From the corner of the roof 
               appears Tony.

                                     TONY
                         I hate to bother you on your 
                         honeymoon, Charlie, but...

               Charlie looks beyond Tony and sees Harriet standing in the 
               doorway. He goes over and puts his arm around Harriet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Thank God. I'm sorry I doubted you, 
                         but I thought you were the killer, 
                         but you were acting pretty strange?

                                     HARRIET
                         I thought you were going to leave 
                         me, like the others. Thank God they 
                         were just murdered. I thought they 
                         were always leaving me.

               Below, Rose is put into a police car and taken off. The SIRENS 
               disappear. So do the crowds.

                                                             DISSOLVE INTO:

               THE SOUND OF A CROWD IN A CLUB:

               INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE

               Charlie is on stage looking very beatnik. He's reading his 
               poetry, but we can't hear it. He nods to someone off stage. 
               Harriet is in the audience, also looking very beatnik with 
               their three year old son, STUART, a miniature beatnik version 
               of Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         My dad was right. You don't lose 
                         your muse once you're married. Nothing 
                         changed, except I gained a great 
                         son, Stuart.

               SOUND UP on Charlie's poetry.

                                     CHARLIE
                         MARRIED MAN
                         MOST MERRY
                         AND IN CONCLUSION

                                     CROWD AND CHARLIE
                         THIS POEM SUCKS.

               The crowd goes crazy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Thank you very much.

               HOUSE MUSIC kicks on. It's Saturday Night by the Bay City 
               Rollers.

                                     BAY CITY ROLLERS
                         S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y NIGHT

               Charlie comes off stage and joins his wife and child at their 
               table. He is very happy.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
