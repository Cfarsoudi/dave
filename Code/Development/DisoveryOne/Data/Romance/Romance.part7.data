               FADE IN:

               EXT. NARITA AIRPORT - NIGHT

               We hear the sound of a plane landing over black.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The back of a GIRL in pink underwear, she leans at a big 
               window, looking out over Tokyo.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Melodramatic music swells over the Girl's butt in pink sheer 
               underwear as she lies on the bed.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               POV from a car window - the colors and lights of Tokyo neon 
               at night blur by.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In the backseat of a Presidential limousine, BOB (late-
               forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, 
               staring out the window.

               P.O.V. from car window- We see buildings covered in bright 
               signs, a billboard of Brad Pitt selling jeans, another of 
               Bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of 
               whiskey in a Suntory ad... more signs, a huge TV with perky 
               Japanese pop stars singing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) 
               pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky 
               rise.

               The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out.   Eager 
               BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, 
               welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               Bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by 
               Japanese businessmen below his shoulders.

               The elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto

               the massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt.

               Bob follows the JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN out into the marble and 
               glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo.

               The CONCIERGE and several eager HOTEL MANAGERS greet Bob. He 
               just wants to sleep, but more STAFF continue to greet him, 
               ask him about his fright. They lead him to reception.

               INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT

               At the reception area four JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN and two WOMEN 
               quickly sit up from their seats on sight of Bob, and extend 
               handshakes and gifts. They bow and introduce themselves from 
               the commercial company, extend name cards and welcome him 
               enthusiastically.

               More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his 
               stay.

               One of them presents a fax that has come for him.

               INSERT -

               "TO: BOB HARRIS

               FROM: LYDIA HARRIS

               YOU FORGOT ADAM'S BIRTHDAY.

               I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

               HAVE A GOOD TRIP, L"

               He doesn't know what to do with it, and stuffs it in his 
               pocket.

               The commercial people tell him when they'll be picking him 
               up, and ask if he needs anything else.

               Some JAPANESE ROCK STARS with shag haircuts and skinny leather 
               pants pass by. Each commercial person has to shake Bob's 
               hand before leaving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob sits on the end of the bed in a too small hotel kimono.

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob sits at the bar. A few minutes pass as he sits in silence 
               looking around, drinking a scotch.  Chet Baker sings "The 
               Thrill is Gone" over the stereo.

               We see Bob's POV of tables of people talking. JAPANESE WOMEN 
               SMOKING, AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN tying one on, talking about 
               software sales. A WAITER carefully setting down a coaster, 
               and pouring a beer very, very slowly. It's all very foreign.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               The automatic hotel curtains open, pouring light into the 
               room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

               Bob gets in the shower overlooking the view of Tokyo. The 
               shower head is at his elbows, he raises it as high as it 
               goes, and leans down to have a shower. This hotel was not 
               designed with him in mind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STUDIO - DAY

               Whiskey commercial shoot.

               The set is full of activity as the JAPANESE CREW work. Bob, 
               in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a European style bar set 
               with a cut crystal glass of whiskey. A JAPANESE GIRL quickly 
               powders his face as they adjust lights and the DIRECTOR and 
               crew speak in hurried Japanese.

               The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long 
               sentences in Japanese.

               TRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, 
               translates but it is only a short sentence now.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         He wants you to turn, look in camera 
                         and say the lines.

               Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it 
               works from Japanese to English.

                                     BOB
                         That's all he said?

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Yes, turn to camera.

               Bob thinks let's just get it over with.

                                     BOB
                         Turn left or right?

               The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the 
               director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director 
               answers her in a long excited phrase.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Right side. And with intensity.

                                     BOB
                         Is that everything? It seemed like 
                         he was saying a lot more.

               The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods 
               in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Like an old friend, and into the 
                         camera.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (to Bob))
                         Suntory Time!

               They get ready, and roll camera:

               Bob turns and looks suavely to the camera:

                                     BOB
                         For relaxing times, make it Suntory 
                         Time.

               The Director yells something about ten sentences long. The 
               translator nods.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Could you do it slower, and with 
                         more intensity?

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

               The Translator answers for him in four sentences.

               ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting 
               shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera 
               and gives them the line.

                                     BOB
                         For relaxing times, make it Suntory 
                         Time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT

               Shinjuku High rises sparkle.

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Tall glass walls show the neon and high-rises of the city.

               A sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays. Bob sits alone 
               with a scotch at the bar.

               Some drunk AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN, with their ties thrown over 
               their shoulders recognize him.

                                     BUSINESS GUY
                         Hey- you're Bob Harris- you're 
                         awesome, man.

                                     ANOTHER BUSINESS GUY
                         Yeah, I love Sunset  Odds! BOB Oh, 
                         Ok, thanks.

                                     BUSINESS GUY
                         Man, that car chase-

               Bob  nods.

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob comes back to his room. The maids have left everything 
               perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the TV has been 
               left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups 
               in nature while sad violin music plays. It's supposed to be 
               relaxing, but it's just sad.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob lies in bed. He flips through TV channels from the remote 
               control.  He passes a Japanese game show, to an 80s Cannon 
               Ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into Japanese. He 
               turns it off as he hears a knock at the door.

               He goes to the door, and opens it part way.

                                     WOMAN (O.C.)
                              (Raspy Japanese voice)
                         Mr. Harris?

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Mr. Kazuzo sent me.

                                     BOB
                         Oh?

                                     WOMAN
                         Can I enter?

               He pauses, then opens the door.

               A WOMAN in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt 
               and stockings comes in. She is wearing '60s style make-up.

               Bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her.

               Bob's POV - We see her back to us as she puts a CD on the 
               stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte 
               Bardot sing "Bonnie & Clyde".  The woman turns slyly around 
               and shimmies over to Bob.

                                     WOMAN
                              (as she tries to 
                              undress him)
                         Mr. Harris?

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Do you like massage?

                                     BOB
                         I don't think so.

                                     WOMAN
                         Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.

               She pushes him back onto the bed. He hesitates, but then 
               goes along with it passively.

                                     WOMAN
                         My stockings.

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Take them.

               He fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says.

                                     WOMAN
                         No - Lip  them... Don't touch me!

               He takes his hands back confused.

                                     WOMAN
                         Lip my stockings! 

               He backs away, as he tries to understand her.

                                     WOMAN
                         Lip them! 

               She throws her leg up to him on the bed.

                                     BOB
                         Huh?

               She pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, you want me to rip them?

               He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just 
               snap.

               She pretends to struggle.

                                     WOMAN
                         Please let me go!

               He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back 
               on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around 
               awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting 
               him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake-
               defense.

                                     WOMAN
                         Let me go! 

               She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know 
               what she wants.

               She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He 
               tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He 
               grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to 
               the floor, the room goes black.

                                     BOB
                         I think you should leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

               In the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast 
               alone. Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats. At 
               another table a JAPANESE COUPLE in sunglasses chain smoke 
               and drink coffee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

               Bob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by 
               the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his 
               stay.

               In the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE 
               and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding.

               Across, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE, 
               a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only 
               other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands 
               out in the crowd.

               She's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in 
               the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the 
               elevator doors.

               Charlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese 
               heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door 
               opens and she gets out with the crowd. Bob watches her leave.

                         Mr. Harris

               He is approached by a group of eight excited people from the 
               commercial company there waiting to take him.

                                     PRESS AGENT
                              (as they are on their 
                              way)
                         We just got a request from Tanabe 
                         Mori-he is the Johnny Carson of Japan! 
                         It is a big honor to be invited to 
                         his show.

               Bob feigns enthusiasm briefly.

                                     MISS KAWASAKI
                         Can you stay until Friday?

                                     BOB
                         I'll have to see about that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PHOTO STUDIO - DAY

               Bob's back is to us as a MAKE-UP ARTIST is putting some final 
               touches on him. The PHOTOGRAPHER is giving her enthusiastic 
               direction in Japanese. Bob talks on his cell phone, not paying 
               attention to the make-up artist.

                                     BOB
                         Can you get me on a flight Thursday 
                         night?

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         We're looking into it Bob, but they 
                         really want you to stay to do that 
                         talk show Friday, apparently it's a 
                         really big deal, he's the Johnny 
                         Carson of Japan.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, they told me.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         These people are paying you a lot, 
                         do you think you could consider it?

                                     BOB
                         Just get me out of here as soon as 
                         you can.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         Ok, you're scheduled to leave 
                         Saturday, but we'll hold a seat 
                         Thursday in case, but first class is 
                         full, you're waitlisted for an 
                         upgrade... there might be a seat on 
                         Lufthansa...

                                     BOB
                         Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, 
                         bye.

               He hangs up. The make-up artist dusts him with powder.

               The commercial people are crowding around. Bob's chair is 
               swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too 
               much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner.

               In front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted 
               and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory.

               small documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera- 
               the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty 
               dutch camera moves.

               The agency people crowd around. The photographer is excited 
               and urges Bob to do dumb poses, he won't do.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Can you put hands close to face.

               The photographer demonstrates a dramatic pose with his hands 
               at his face.

                                     BOB
                         Urn, I don't think so. How bout I 
                         just hold the bottle.

               The photographer starts shooting. Bob obviously hates the 
               whole thing, what you do for money.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits 
               alone having a drink. A JAZZ BAND FROM SAUSALITO performs. 
               The SINGER is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed 
               in red, and takes her singing very seriously. She sings a 
               slow version of "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme".

               C.U. - a golden beer is poured very slowly.

               Bob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away.

               Across the bar, Charlotte sits with JOHN, her husband (he is 
               in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way), and 
               some FRIENDS - super stylish, weird Japanese fashion people 
               (all smoking). One of them, CHARLIE, in a shiny suit, keeps 
               taking pictures, and showing them magazine layouts.

                                     JAZZ SINGER
                         Thank you. We're glad to be here, 
                         we're Sausalito.

               Charlotte laughs and looks down, the Japanese audience clap 
               very seriously... she and Bob catch eyes - about Sausalito 
               and how weird it is there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - LATER

               The mirrored elevator doors close and Bob sees himself close-
               up in the elevator's mirrored walls - noticing the heavy 
               makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had 
               forgotten about. He looks at himself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlotte lays close to her young husband, John. She looks 
               to see if he's awake, but he's sleeping soundly. She leans 
               her chin on his shoulder.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Are you awake?

               He doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         John?

               He grumbles something, opens one sleepy eye to look at her, 
               and grabs her under the covers. He kisses her.

                                     JOHN
                         Go to sleep.

               He holds her close, but she can't sleep.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte sits on a ledge looking out at the big buildings. 
               The sun is starting to come up. Below she watches cars going 
               places.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob lies in bed awake. The clock says 4:20.

               The in-room fax machine is making noise as a fax rolls in. 
               Bob looks at the fax machine but doesn't get out of bed.

               The fax curls and falls to the floor.

               CLOSE ON FAX -

               "BOB-

               YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHICH SHELVES YOU WANT IN YOUR STUDY. 
               PLEASE PICK ONE OUT AND LET ME KNOW. I'M HAVING LOTS OF 
               QUALITY TIME WITH THE CONSTRUCTION CREW. HOPE YOU'RE HAVING 
               FUN THERE. LOVE, L"

               Three pages of shelf diagrams follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL GYM - NIGHT

               The gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming. Bob passes 
               piles of little towels and bottles of water. He takes a water 
               for his workout.

               He approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the 
               drink holder of the machine. He looks at the lit-up 
               instruction panel'99 it is all in Japanese.

               He pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a 
               soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese.

               He gets on it, and sinks. He tries to make the arms and foot 
               peddles coordinate. He pushes a button and it starts moving 
               too fast. In an upward rotation he tries to reach the control 
               panel, but is not fast enough. The soothing woman's voice 
               continues instruction.(she occasionally includes an English 
               word- gently,   gently...vigorous)   He tries to keep up 
               with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it 
               down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards 
               instead.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

               The agency group wait for Bob. They stand up as he approaches 
               from the elevator, trying to mask a slight limp.

                                     BOB
                              (everything's fine)
                         Good morning.

               Miss Kawasaki notices his limp with concern as they leave 
               the hotel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA STATION - DAY

               Charlotte gets out at shibuya station, a crowded neighborhood 
               filled with neon, ads, and people.

               She looks up at the huge intersection as tons of JAPANESE 
               PEOPLE wait to cross the street, no one steps forward until 
               the cross-walk light changes, and all of them cross.

               A TV screen covering a building plays commercials.

               She roams around the narrow streets, crowded with stylish 
               JAPANESE KIDS, tan SCHOOLGIRLS pass her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte wanders down a crowded street, looking around.

               On a small side street she stops at a little park. She watches 
               a JAPANESE MAN AND WOMAN together:

               CHARLOTTE'S POV -

               C.U. The man reaches his hand to the back of the woman's 
               neck, and leans in close. The woman smiles at him, in love.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               John is sound asleep. Charlotte is awake next to him. She 
               looks at the clock - it's three a.m.

               She slides close to him, kisses his mouth. He grumbles 
               something in his deep sleep, and rolls over.

               She goes to the couch, stepping over camera equipment.

               She looks at the fruit basket, decides to try an apple. She 
               has a piece but isn't really hungry.

               She reaches over some proof sheets and looks at a magazine, 
               but she's already looked at it a few times before. She decides 
               to go downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob sits alone at the bar. Charlotte sits down a seat away 
               from him, lost in his thoughts, he doesn't see her until he 
               turns and finds her next to him. They look at each other. A 
               young BARTENDER with a sweet face tends to them.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What can I get you?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm not sure.

                                     BOB
                              (line from commercial)
                         For relaxing times, make it

                         'Suntory time'!

               Charlotte smiles at him sympathetically

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What are you doing here?

                                     BOB
                         My wife needs space, I don't know my 
                         kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants 
                         Tiger Woods, but they could get me, 
                         so I'm here doing a whiskey 
                         commercial.

               She looks at him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh.

               She lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'll just have a beer.

               He makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and 
               jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days.

                                     BOB
                         What about you? Why are you here?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         My husband's here for work-he's a 
                         photographer- and I just came 
                         along...I'm not really doing anything 
                         right now, and we have some friends 
                         who live here.

                                     BOB

                         Try twenty-five.

                         You're probably just having a mid-
                         life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?

                                     BOB
                         I'm thinking about it.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         25 years... that's a long time... 
                         Are you still in love with your wife?

                                     BOB
                         Yes... I don't know, I don't know 
                         her anymore. I don't know if you can 
                         be in love with one person the whole 
                         time. I was... actually I was in 
                         love with her sister first, when I 
                         was twenty-one. And one day her sister 
                         said to me she wanted to move to 
                         Paris, so I said okay, and she said 
                         no, she wanted to move to Paris with 
                         Francois,   and she's still married 
                         to him. And I moved in with Lydia... 
                         but I always really liked Lydia.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (amused with too much 
                              info)
                         Oh.

                                     BOB
                         What do you do?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm not sure, yet... I graduated 
                         last spring.

                                     BOB
                         What did you study?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Philosophy.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, what do you do with that?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, but I can think about 
                         it, a lot.

                                     BOB
                         It takes a while to figure it out. 
                         I'm sure you will, though.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis 
                         will work out,too.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks.

               They clink glasses.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               The hotel is filled with business people. A dressed up FAMILY 
               is going to lunch. We follow a jet-lagged Charlotte and John, 
               as they walk down the lobby hall.

               An energetic blonde actress, KELLY, pops up to them. (She's 
               carrying a copy of Memoirs of a Geisha.)

               John, who was holding Charlotte's hand, drops it.

                                     KELLY
                         John! What are you doing here?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm just here shooting this band, 
                         what about you?

                                     KELLY
                         Promoting that action movie I did...

               She does a karate chop and laughs.

                                     KELLY
                         ...doing like twenty million 
                         interviews a day... It's soo good to 
                         see you. How long are you here for?

                                     JOHN
                         We're here for the week. I'm shooting 
                         in Osaka for a few days.

                                     KELLY
                         It's amazing  there!

                                     JOHN
                         Have you met Charlotte? My wife.

                                     KELLY
                         No!  Hi! So great to meet you!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi, nice to meet you.

                                     KELLY
                         You know, John, you're my favorite 
                         photographer, I only want to be shot 
                         by you.

               Charlotte looks at John.

                                     JOHN
                         Uh..thanks.

                                     KELLY
                              (as she fans out her 
                              top)
                         Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've 
                         been sweating in this little room 
                         with T.V. lights for hours...

               Kelly, giggling and acting all too comfortable with herself, 
               is eating up all the oxygen around them.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh no...

                                     KELLY
                              (with a big smile)
                         ...Well, I have the worst  headache, 
                         I have to go find some aspirin. But, 
                         call me, let's have a drink, I'm 
                         under Evelyn Waugh.

               Kelly giggles. Charlotte smirks.

                                     JOHN
                         Ok, see you later.

               And Kelly and her make-up artist and publicist are off. John 
               and Charlotte continue.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Evelyn Waugh?

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Evelyn Waugh was a man.

               John shrugs.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, c'mon, she's nice.  Not everyone 
                         went to Yale.

               Charlotte shoots him a look.

                                     JOHN
                         Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't 
                         matter.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why do you have to defend her?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm not, but do you have to point 
                         out how stupid everyone is.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, I thought it was funny. Forget 
                         it.

               His producer comes up to them. John puts his arm around 
               Charlotte, kisses her, everything's fine.

                                     PRODUCER
                              (looks at his watch)
                         We should get going.

                                     JOHN
                         OK, I'll see you later.

               He kisses her on the cheek, and is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         dinner and she was telling me about 
                         her daughter who had this awful 
                         boyfriend and a messy break-up and 
                         how hard it is,and now she's single

                         glad that you're settled, and not in

               An Olympic pool is framed by tall glass walls with the Tokyo 
               view. Bob is handed a swim cap and goggles.

               Bob watches a Japanese BUSINESSMAN swimming, he looks like 
               an over-grown baby.

               Bob swims laps in the pristine pool.

               He continues his laps. Under water he sees the jumping legs 
               of MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN.

               A disco mixed tape starts, and above water we see a WESTERN 
               INSTRUCTOR in tight shorts leading an aqua-aerobics class to 
               the group of WOMEN, They jump up and down to Sister Sledge.

               corner.

               Bob comes out from the sauna, red and sweaty.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY

               Charlotte lies on the floor with big headphones on, listening 
               to a book on tape. After a corny music intro, a very serious 
               scholar man's voice speaks clearly :

               DR. KENGARD (0.S.) Did you ever wonder what your purpose in 
               life is? This book is about finding your soul's purpose or 
               destiny. Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is 
               not clear.  The acorn theory is an example of each soul 
               beginning with an imprint....

               Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling 
               like a loser listening to a self-help tape. She looks at the

               INT. HOTEL - DAY

               Charlotte follows a JAPANESE FAMILY in formal dress out of 
               the elevator onto the mezzanine level. She wanders down a 
               big hall.

               She sees an open door and steps in the crowded room, which 
               is in the midst of a press conference. Cameras flash as Kelly, 
               with wide eyes, behind a table, answers questions 
               enthusiastically.

               KELLY You know, barbecuing, and yoga, and I love taking my 
               dogs, Buster and Lulu, for walks on the beach... and it was 
               great learning karate for "Midnight Racer" - I did all my 
               own stunts!

               The JAPANESE JOURNALISTS seem excited by her answer.

               Kelly throws a Karate punch for a PHOTOGRAPHER.

                         What was it like working with Keanu 
                         Reeves?

                                     KELLY
                         It was great. I've known him for a 
                         while now- you know we both live in 
                         L.A. We both have dogs...

               Charlotte walks out.

               INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

               Charlotte continues down a hall, she stops at an open door 
               and peeks in.

               A quiet group of JAPANESE WOMEN are gathered around a table. 
               Charlotte goes in, as she gets closer she sees they are being 
               instructed in Ikebana floral design. Each woman has a little 
               vase and elegant flower cuttings. She watches as they 
               delicately arrange the tiny flowers.

               The INSTRUCTOR hands Charlotte a vase and cuttings. Alongside 
               the women, Charlotte tries to follow along.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL - BATHROOM

               Charlotte reclines low in the bathtub staring off. She can 
               see mount Fuji in the distance.

               The audio tape plays on the stereo.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

               With her back to us, Charlotte looks out the big window.

               John comes up and kisses her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How'd it go today?

                                     JOHN
                         Good...I'm tired.

               He hugs her for a moment, leaning on her.

                                     JOHN
                         I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink 
                         downstairs. She wants to talk about 
                         some photo thing.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.

                                     JOHN
                         You wanna come?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Sure.

                                     JOHN
                              (doesn't really want 
                              her to)
                         Ok.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               At a corner table Charlotte sits with John, Kelly, and DJ 
               CLEAN, a skinny kid in a sweatshirt, on tour in Japan.

               Charlotte is bored while Kelly talks on.

               Sausalito performs in the background.

                                     KELLY
                         ...My Dad was anorexic.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         (she's never heard of that)
                         Really?

               John shoots Charlotte a look.

                                     KELLY
                              (very serious)
                         He was on the American side at the 
                         Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was 
                         taken prisoner, and they tortured 
                         them about their food the whole time.

                         Where?

                                     KELLY
                         My dad fought on the American side 
                         at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was 
                         a prisoner, they would tell them 
                         they had put poison in their food 
                         and they would make themselves throw 
                         up... and when he got back, he did 
                         better, but he still has food issues. 
                         He has to have really clean food.  
                         And really simple. He can't just go 
                         have, say, Chinese food.

                                     JOHN
                              (trying)
                         Oh, that's too bad.

               Charlotte ashes her cigarette in a clean ashtray, and she 
               watches as it is quickly replaced with a new one by a WAITER.

                                     BENZO
                              (nodding at the view)
                         How crazy is this shit?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah, it is.

               DJ Clean starts doing a human beat box at her.

               Charlotte looks over at Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         ...Oh my god you have to try it, 
                         this power cleanse is amazing- it's 
                         lemon juice and grade B maple syrup 
                         and cayenne pepper for seven days. 
                         Just like a half a teaspoon of 
                         cayenne. The first few days you're a 
                         little scattered, but by day four - 
                         it's amazing... my eyes were so 
                         white...

               Charlotte excuses herself.

               She passes Bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar, as she 
               is leaving.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi again, how's it going?

                                     BOB
                         Who do I have to fuck to get off 
                         this planet?

               Charlotte laughs with sympathy, but doesn't know what to 
               tell him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               John sleeps soundly (turned away from her), Charlotte can't 
               sleep. She turns on the T.V. to a crazy local T.V. variety 
               show.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob can't sleep, he watches the same show on T,V.

               He flips the channel- it's an old black & white Japanese 
               movie of a man committing Hari Kari.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. TOKYO - MORNING

               Charlotte finds her way down a narrow street in an old section 
               of Tokyo.

               She turns a corner and finds a square with what she was 
               looking for.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TEMPLE - DAY

               The sun shines over a beautiful old temple. Birds chirp, 
               Charlotte approaches and goes inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TEMPLE - DAY

               Charlotte stands in the back and watches a ceremony.

               A ROSHI speaks in Japanese, monks chant. It's all very 
               foreign.  Charlotte tries to feel something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte sits on the bed talking to John who's coming out 
               of the bathroom, getting ready to go to work. He checks 
               himself in the mirror, CHARLOTTE Am I shallow?

                                     JOHN
                         No, what are you talking about.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I went to a temple today and I didn't 
                         feel anything.

                                     JOHN
                         That's ok.

               He looks for his mobile phone.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know what to do.

                                     JOHN
                         That's ok, you'll figure it out.

               He comes close and kisses her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You smell weird.

                         What?

               She leans back to look at him.

                         I got some hair stuff.

               She looks at him funny.

                         I gotta go to work.

               He grabs her, kissing her good-bye, she wraps her him, when 
               his cell phone rings.

                         leaving...ok.

               He kisses her, and leaves.

                                     JOHN
                         See you later.

                         It's cool... but,I don't know... I 
                         went to a shrine today and all these 
                         little monk's were chanting... and, 
                         I didn't feel anything... I even 
                         tried ikebana, ...   and John's using 
                         hair products... I don't know who 
                         I.

               Lauren's Call-waiting beeps, cutting off her sentence.

                                     LAUREN
                         Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?

                         Sure.

               Charlotte waits.

                         Sorry about that, what were you 
                         saying?

               In the background a baby starts crying.

                         Oh, it's nothing... I better go, 
                         I'll talk to you later.

                         Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky 
                         you don't have any kids yet and you 
                         can go off to Japan... call me when

                         Ok, bye.

               She hangs up. She sits there for a moment, starting to cry, 
               she wipes the tears, trying to make them go away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Tokyo goes by out the window. Charlotte looks at the PEOPLE 
               on the crowded train. A sweaty BUSINESSMAN blots his face 
               with a little handkerchief.  Another older BUSINESSMAN reads 
               an erotic comic book.

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte looks up at the many signs, trying to figure out

               which way to go, but they are all in Japanese characters. 
               Confused, she chooses the west exit.

               EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte walks down a little street in a quiet neighborhood.

               She stops at a window of a portrait studio and looks at all 
               of the wedding portraits. They are very formal and retouched, 
               Japanese brides and grooms dressed in a Western old-fashion 
               style.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ARCADE - DAY

               Charlotte looks through the window as a tan Japanese boy, 
               tries to win a stuffed animal for his girlfriend.

               INT. ARCADE - AFTERNOON

               In a crowded arcade, Charlotte watches some kids play Dance 
               Revolution, a video game where you dance along to cues on 
               the

               light-up floor. One BUSINESSMAN in a suit is really good and 
               into it.

               She sees a sushi chef game where you have to cut an electronic 
               fish.

               She looks at a firefighter game, and rows of plexi boxes 
               filled with some little character dolls you try to win.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GALLERY BOOKSTORE - DAY

               Charlotte looks at the shelves of books she passes, she flips 
               through some books.

               She walks over to a small gallery space and goes up to the 
               wall to see the small photos.

               They are of tied-up, partially naked Japanese school girls, 
               one girl is spanking another one with a stuffed animal. She's 
               making a face of ecstacy.

               Charlotte looks at it, not getting it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA - DAY

               Charlotte stands alone on a side street, smoking a cigarette 
               and watching the CROWDS go by.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA - DAY

               Charlotte walks up a little street filled with shops.

               She stops at a window of cute underwear that she.looks at. 
               She goes into the shop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               51C.U. Charlotte's lips. She puts watermelon color lipstick 
               on.She looks at herself in the mirror in her new underwear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               We hear the shower running in the bathroom.

               Charlotte decorates the room, putting up some paper cherry 
               blossom decorations.

               She goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it, as she 
               flops down.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ouch.

               She holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness.

               John talks to her from the shower.

                                     JOHN (O.C.)
                         At the fitting, they had all these 
                         rock n roll clothes, the label guys 
                         kept saying lock n loll, though, but 
                         the band doesn't look tough at 
                         all...they look better just skinny 
                         and nerdy, like how when they came 
                         in...they looked so uncomfortable in 
                         these Keith Richards clothes, they 
                         should just be like they are, don't 
                         you think?

               She's drifted off.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah, I think you're probably right... 
                         because when you try to...

               He gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go. 
               Charlotte's lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear.

               She tries her scarf on that she's been knitting.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Do you think it's done?

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know.

               He goes to get all his stuff together.

               He passes an ashtray with cigarette butts in it.

                                     JOHN
                         Will you please stop smoking?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But I like to... and I don't smoke 
                         that much.

                                     JOHN
                         Its bad for you.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ok, I will... later.

               He picks up a camera from a table in the corner. He looks at 
               the self-help audio book box.

                                     JOHN
                         A Soul's Search: Finding Your True 
                         Character and calling? Is this yours?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh... that's nothing, someone gave 
                         it to me.

                                     JOHN
                         You don't have to be embarrassed.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm 
                         not into it.

                                     JOHN
                         It's ok if you are.

               He kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute 
               pet, and then continues getting his stuff together.

               John sets two bottles of Cristal on the bed next to her, not 
               really seeing her.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, the record company sent these...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.

                                     JOHN
                         I gotta go... and I don't really 
                         like champagne.

               As he unplugs his cell phone from the wall.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you sure you want to stay?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Are you sure you have to go?

               He looks at her - like don't make it harder.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah, I know you have to work the 
                         whole time, I'll probably have more 
                         fun here. I'll call Charlie and those 
                         guys.

                                     JOHN
                         Ok, definitely call them, I'll be 
                         back Friday. I love you.

               They kiss.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I love you.

               He tackles her, kisses her, bites her, grabs her ribs, 
               tickling her in a burst of affection. She laughs, her arms 
               around his neck.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I miss you.

                                     JOHN
                         It'll just be a few days.

               He kisses her and is off.

               Charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of 
               champagne.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT POOL - EVENING

               Water splashes as Charlotte dives into the pool (in a one-
               piece bathing suit) as the sun goes down.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. PARK HYATT HALL - EVENING

               Leaving in her robe, Charlotte runs into Bob, in his robe, 
               going to the pool.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, hi.

                                     BOB
                              (awkward, but glad to 
                              run into her)
                         Hi. Did you have a nice swim?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah. Did you get some sleep?

                                     BOB
                         No, how about you?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Not really. How long are you here 
                         for?

                                     BOB
                         I'm here for the week.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, good. Do you want to go to a 
                         party tonight with me and some friends 
                         who live here?

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         See you later.

               He watches her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - EVENING

               As Bob opens his door to his room, a FedEx package falls in 
               his path.

               He opens it - large carpet swatches fall out with a note

               "BOB - WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR STUDY? I LIKE THE 
               BURGUNDY, BUT WHATEVER YOU WANT. LOVE, L"

               He looks at them for a second, they all look the same, and 
               why is she sending these? He puts them down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               The elaborate chiming doorbell rings.

               Charlotte opens the door to see Bob. He's wearing an orange 
               camouflage T-shirt. She looks at his shirt, suppressing a 
               smile.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You really are having a mid-life 
                         crisis.

                                     BOB
                              (embarrassed)
                         I know, it's stupid.

               He goes into the bathroom to change it. He comes out with it 
               on inside out so it's just an orange T-shirt.

               He asks her to cut the label out for him. She goes to find 
               some scissors. He picks up A Soul's Search: Finding Your 
               True Calling audio-book box.

                                     BOB
                         A Soul's Search: Finding Your True 
                         Calling - are you reading this?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No.

               She returns with the hotel room sewing kit.

                                     BOB
                         I read it, too.

               She smiles, busted, but doesn't say anything as she cuts his 
               shirt label with little hotel sewing-kit scissors.

               She slips on her shoes on to leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOKYO BAR - NIGHT

               All white nightclub, lit with black lights so it seems to 
               glow in the dark, with the booming sound of helicopters. 
               JAPANESE GALLAGER BROTHERS walk by.

               Bob watches Charlotte as Charlie, in a crazy outfit, hugs 
               her.  Charlotte tries to talk to Bob over the loud music.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie 
                         Brown.

                                     BOB
                         Hi, Charlie.

               They shake hands.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         His real name's Hayashi, but someone 
                         started calling him Charlie because 
                         they thought he looked like Charlie 
                         Brown. They've all got American 
                         nicknames because its easier for me 
                         to remember... they were just out in 
                         L.A. last month doing a shoot with 
                         John... that guy's Mr.Valentine, 
                         he's the art director of their 
                         magazine, I don't even know his real 
                         name, or why I call him that.

               Bob looks over at some SKINNY GUY in huge glasses smiling at 
               them. Charlie hands them some drinks.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Bambi.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi.

               A young SHY GUY with a shaved head smiles at her, and takes 
               her picture.

               A JAPANESE KRAFTWERK COVER-BAND plays Trans Europa Express.

               Some people at the bar buy drinks for Bob and insist on 
               drinking with him.

               Bob and Charlotte look over as Charlie gets into some problem 
               with the BARTENDER.  The Bartender gets mad and starts 
               shooting a real-looking BB gun at him. Orange bullets fly 
               through the air. They all rush out of there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte try to get past the crowd at the entrance. 
               A big BOUNCER stops them and is yelling fast Japanese at 
               him.

               The crowd parts as the Bartender emerges shooting his BB 
               gun, and Bob and Charlotte run for it.

               BB GUN CHASE -

               The Bartender climbs on a car, threatening them from above. 
               Bob covers Charlotte as they duck behind the car.

               They make a run for it, ducking into a pachinko parlor.

               INT.PACHINKO PARLOR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte run past the blinking machines, and 
               gamblers, to another door to the street.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Bob spots a cab and they run to it, seeing Charlie now 
               throwing bottles in the direction of the bartender.

               Bob and Charlotte get in the cab.

               INT. CAB - NIGHT

               Charlotte hits her head as they get in. Bob yells to the 
               driver to go, but he doesn't understand.

               Through the windshield they see the Bartender and sidekick 
               coming with baseball bats.

               They hear a bang on the door and Charlie hops in. He makes 
               sure she is ok and shouts something to the Driver, and they 
               speed away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

               Charlie, in his flashy outfit, sings "God Save the Queen" 
               into the Karaoke mic. He rolls his r's just like Johnny 
               Rotten.

               Charlotte laughs and loves watching Charlie. They're other 
               friends wear the different color wigs they provide at this 
               place. There are big bottles of beer and sake.  They are all 
               pretty formal. Bambi tries to talk to Charlotte with a big 
               grin, he can barely speak English.

                                     BAMBI
                         How's california?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (smiles)
                         Good.

                                     BAMBI
                         Good... I like your swimming pool.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks, you guys should come back 
                         sometime.

                                     BAMBI
                         Yes.

               He tries wigs on her. He puts a light pink wig on her and 
               beams. Bob smokes and watches.

                                     BAMBI
                         Kawaii.
                              (Kawaii means "cute")

               She smiles a lovable smile at Bambi.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlie and Charlotte sings "Brass in Pocket" by The 
               Pretenders ("you're special, so special..."), everyone is 
               drunk now, as they all sing along at the chorus. WOMEN keep 
               refilling the glasses.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Mr. Valentine sings a popular slow heartfelt Japanese song 
               that everyone knows and sings along to. Charlotte and Bob 
               look at each other, it is very foreign, but Bob likes being 
               there with Charlotte and her friends.

               She flips through a big binder of songs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What do you feel like singing, Bob?

                                     BOB
                         No way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob sings "I fall to Pieces" to Charlotte. Charlie and 
               everyone cheers for him.

               Beer pitchers are replaced. Charlie starts singing "Angle". 
               The little room is fxlled with smoke, Charlotte makes her 
               way to the door to get some air.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARAOKE BAR HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Taking a break from the crowded and hot Karaoke room, 
               Charlotte sits for a break alone on a bench in the bright 
               hallway. It is quiet with just the muffled sound of music 
               from the Karaoke room. She's wearing a pink geisha wig. Bob 
               sits down next to her.

               Charlotte lights his cigarette with some crazy Japanese light-
               up lighter.

               She leans her head back - it's getting too heavy.

               She looks at his hands.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You bite your nails?

               He nods.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I could cut the ones that are left 
                         for you.

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NOBU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

               NOBU, a cool skinny stoner guy in a Hawaiian shirt, plays 
               phsycadellic records in his seventies hippie surfer-pad.

               His JAPANESE  GIRLFRIEND, who looks like a 60's pin-up,   
               pours cold sake.

               Bob is  handed a ridiculously big bong.

               Charlie is drunk and taking polaroids.

               Nobu, really stoned, talks to Bob about surfing.

               A SHORT GUY with thick glasses introduces himself to 
               Charlotte, extending his hand.

                                     HANS
                         I'm Hans.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hans?  Nice to meet you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlie takes pictures of Charlotte and HIROMIX, a sexy 
               Japanese girl, posing on a sheepskin run. They are being 
               hammy for Charlie who loves it.

               Bob walks up and is amused watching her, she sees him and 
               gets embarrassed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DECADENT TOKYO PARTY - NIGHT

               Hiromix dances  Charlotte dances with Hans - she looks sweaty 
               but beautiful... Bob dances with his eyes closed, really 
               into it, in the midst of all of them... the song "I Feel Too 
               Young" plays.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NOBU'S ENTRY - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte are leaving Nobu's. She's wearing Bob's 
               jacket.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Make sure she gets home okay?

                                     BOB
                         I will.

               Bob takes Charlotte's arm carefully just as she bangs her 
               head walking into the glass door - it makes a loud thud.

                                     BOB
                         Are you ok?

               She nods. Bob looks back at Charlie who is watching- she's 
               fine.

               He leads her into a waiting cab.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               POV from cab - Tokyo neon blurs by. It looks beautiful.

               INT. CAB - NIGHT

               Charlotte looks at the neon going by. She looks over at Bob, 
               her eyelids are too heavy for her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't want to go home.

                                     BOB
                         I know. I don't either.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL HALL - NIGHT

               Bob carries a very drunk Charlotte to her room. Her purse 
               dangling from his arm.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               He puts her on her bed. He takes her shoes off for her and 
               pulls a blanket over her.

               He looks at her lying on the bed.

               She opens her eyes to smile at him. He wants to kiss her, 
               but he leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOTEL HALL - NIGHT

               He walks down the empty hall, not wanting to leave her.

               As he goes he looks at various trays of leftover room service 
               in the hallway.

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob comes back to his room, tripping over the carpet samples.

               He makes a phone call from bed. He's still a little drunk 
               and thinking about his night out in Tokyo.

                                     BOB

                         He was this fashion guy, and there 
                         were all these Japanese fashion people-
                         it's a whole other world, and I was 
                         talking to these Japanese surfers...  
                         He was playing all this great music- 
                         I have to find out what it was...

                         Well, you have to have something for 
                         breakfast. Do you want cereal?

               He hangs up.

               Charlotte can-'t get out of bed. She looks at the clock- 
               it's 10 a.m.  She picks up the phone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Thanks for getting me back in one 
                         piece.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Of course.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Do you want to have some breakfast?

               C.U. her hand wraps the phone cord around her fingers.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and 
                         I'll meet you downstairs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         OK, see you downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

               They sit in the bright light. She squints and drinks a Bloody 
               Mary. Bob is distant.

               She looks across at two middle-aged MID-WESTERN WOMEN talking 
               about plastic surgery, you can't hear them, but can tell as 
               they gesture and one pulls her eye lids up.

               Charlotte looks at another table by the elaborate buffet and 
               sees the redhead Singer having breakfast with the rest of 
               Sausalito.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (trying to make it 
                              light)
                         Hey look, it's Sausalito.

                                     BOB
                         I see them every morning.

               They don't know what to say. Somehow it's too intimate having 
               breakfast. She eats her breakfast aware of her every movement.

               C.U. - her POV of soft scrambled eggs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

               In the distance, Bob swings on a perfect golf course.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlotte lies in bed awake. The clock says its 4 a.m.

               Finally she gives up on trying to sleep, and turns the light 
               on. In John's old T-shirt and Ugg boots, she goes to the 
               couch, looks at some strange pastry with an elaborate 
               presentation left by the hotel.

               She picks up a magazine, but she's already looked at it a 
               few times before. She hears something and goes over to the 
               door. On her way, she passes her red T. Anthony suitcase 
               overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in 
               it.

               A HOTEL MESSAGE envelope is slipped under the door. She opens 
               it to see a typed note from the operator:

               "From: Mr. Harris. Message: Are you awake?"

               She smiles like she's gotten a valentine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob opens the door, Charlotte's standing there trying to 
               look casual, she's happy to see him (she's put some pants on 
               and flip flops instead of her dumb looking Ugg boots).

               She knocks into a low table, bumping her knee as she comes 
               in.

               Bob pours some cold sake, smoothly.

               Bob and Charlotte watch La Dolce Vita with Japanese subtitles 
               on the TV.

                                     BOB
                         Hans was very attentive to you.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I think he kind of liked me...Is 
                         that so hard to imagine?

                                     BOB
                         No, its easy.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How'd a Japanese guy get a name like 
                         Hans?

                                     BOB
                         I don't know.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte gets up to pour more sake.

               She picks up and looks at a prescription bottle on his night 
               stand and reads the label : Lipitor.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Do you remember when we met at the 
                         bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.

                                     BOB
                         But the first time I saw you was in 
                         the elevator.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Really?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, you don't remember?

               She shrugs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Did I scowl at you?

                                     BOB
                         No, you smiled.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't remember.

                                     BOB
                         I know, I kind of blend in here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Why do they switch the r's and l's 
                         here?

                                     BOB (O.C.)
                         I don't know. My fax said "have a 
                         good fright".

                                     CHARLOTTE (O.C.)
                         Let's never come here again, because 
                         it would never be as much fun.

                                     BOB (O.C.)
                         Ok, whatever you want.

                         Did you see Hiromix last night dancing 
                         with Bambi?

                                     BOB (O.C.)
                         No, I was looking at you.

                                     CHARLOTTE (O.C.)
                         Oh.  Well... they were dancing on 
                         the couch with that weird English 
                         guy who kept talking about hanging 
                         out with the Sex Pistols on Kings 
                         Road...

                         I got a fax today from your friend 
                         Hiromix.

                         Oh, for her show?

                                     BOB (O.C.)
                         No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, 
                         for her show.

                         I know.

                         I'm stuck. Does it get easier.

                                     BOB
                         No, yes, it does...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah? But look at you.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks. It does, the more you know 
                         who you are... you don't care about 
                         things the same way...

                         I just don't know what I'm supposed 
                         to be. I thought maybe I wanted to 
                         be a writer... but I hate what I 
                         write, and I tried taking pictures, 
                         but John's so good at that, and mine 
                         are so mediocre... and every girl 
                         goes through a photography phase, 
                         like horses, you know dumb pictures 
                         of your feet...

                         You'll figure it out. I'm not worried 
                         about you. Keep writing.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But, I'm mean.

                                     BOB
                         That's ok.

                         And marriage, does that get easier?

                                     BOB
                         It's hard. We started going to a 
                         marriage counselor.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Did that help? Did you learn anything?

                                     BOB
                         We established that we have no 
                         communication.

                         Oh.

                                     BOB
                         We used to have fun, she used to 
                         like to go to places with me for my 
                         movies and we would laugh at all the 
                         weirdos, but now she's tired of it 
                         all. She never wants to leave the 
                         kids, she doesn't need me, and they 
                         don't need me, I feel like I'm in 
                         the way. It gets complicated when 
                         you have kids... that changes 
                         everything.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's too scary.

                         When they're born its like Vietnam. 
                         It's terrifying.

                              (getting tired)

                         after they can talk, and can do things 
                         with you.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's nice. My parents were always 
                         traveling, they weren't around so 
                         much.

                         In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador 
                         to France in the eighties, so we 
                         went to school in Paris for a few 
                         years... but we mostly lived in D.C., 
                         and they were never around... and 
                         then I moved to Los Angeles when 
                         John and I got married... it's so 
                         different there.

               They are starting to get tired.

                                     BOB
                         I know.

                         John thinks I'm so snotty.

                                     BOB
                         You are.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know, but that's what you like 
                         about me.

               She looks over at him. He does like her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why do you have to be with your 
                         opposite, why cant similar people be 
                         together?

                                     BOB
                         Because that would be too easy.

               They fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite 
               sides of the bed.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT.STREET BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

               Full of life, Bob plays basketball with some local guys.

               All over the court, and towering over the other players, Bob 
               dominates the game.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror, he feels his 
               stubble and sees that it's turning grey.

               He opens the hotel shaving kit. He squirts shaving cream 
               from the child-size can. Even the razor is small. He covers 
               his face with shaving cream when the phone rings.

                                     BOB
                         Hello?

                                     RECEPTION
                         Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                     RECEPTION
                         Do you want I send it to your room?

                                     BOB
                              (sarcastic)
                         Great.

                                     RECEPTION
                         Thank you, Mr. Harris.

               He hangs up and shaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - DAY

               Bob gets out of the elevator- the Suntory group is waiting 
               for him. He ducks behind a wall and sneaks out a side entrance 
               of the hotel.

               EXT. PARK HYATT - DAY

               Bob comes out of the hotel into the sunlight. The street is 
               crowded with MOTORCYCLE GANGS going by, one waves a big flag.

               Bob watches the strange scene in the street for a moment, 
               and then makes his way past.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DAKINYAMA - DAY

               He walks down a little street in a more old-fashioned 
               neighborhood. He's wearing new techno sneakers. He makes a 
               call on his cell phone.

                                     BOB
                         Miss Kawasaki? It's Bob Harris... 
                         I'm not going to be able to do that 
                         interview today.., yeah... ok.... 
                         Yes, I'd love to stay to be on his 
                         talk show... sure.. ok... bye.

               A light rain starts as he looks at a fax from Charlotte with 
               a map she's drawn and tries to figure out where he is - there 
               are no street signs.

               EXT/INT. ICHICAN SUSHI - DAY

               Bob finally finds the small restaurant. The automatic door 
               opens for him, and Charlotte, at the bar with the cute chubby 
               SUSHI CHEF, turns to Bob happy to see him. He is disheveled 
               from the rain and adorable.

               He sits down next to Charlotte, she pours him a beer and 
               orders for him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You made it.

                                     BOB
                         They really have to work on that 
                         street name thing.

               A perky recording voice says "Kornichiwa!" from his pocket.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What's that?

               He pulls a pink Hello Kitty watch from his pocket.

                                     BOB
                         It's for my daughter.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How old is she?

                                     BOB
                         Four.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, she'll love it.

               The Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a 
               banana leaf.

               Charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so 
               she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. 
               Bob makes fun of her gracelessness.

                                     BOB
                         Nice one.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (mouth full)
                         Fuck off.

               They have lunch, he makes her laugh.

               He looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple.

                                     BOB
                         What happened to your toe?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, I think maybe I broke 
                         it? I knocked into something the 
                         other day...

               She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe 
               is black and blue.

                                     BOB
                         That doesn't look good.

               She enjoys the sympathy.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It's bad isn't it?

                                     BOB
                         We should get you to the doctor.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You think so?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, look at that thing.

               She smiles at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DAIKANYAMA STREET - DAY

               Bob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in. 
               He tries to explain "hospital", he does pantomime, draws a 
               first aid cross, but the DRIVER doesn't understand. Charlotte 
               is enjoying Bob's effort.

               Finally he finds a Park Hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel 
               number.

                                     BOB
                         How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?

                         One moment, please.

               She transfers call, it rings.

                                     BOB
                         Yes, can you tell me how to say 
                         "hospital" in Japanese?

                         Hosupitari? 

               He tells the Driver who looks at him funny. Bob says it again-
               faster, with a Japanese accent. The driver nods excitedly 
               and drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

               Bob and Charlotte walk in, looking around at where to go.

               Bob talks to a woman at the desk to explain what they need.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob takes a seat in waiting area as Charlotte goes into a 
               little room with a number on it.

               Bob waits next to a 100 year old lady.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte stands alone barefoot on a little box, wearing a 
               lead apron, as a MAN and ASSISTANT X-ray different angles of 
               her foot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP - DAY

               Bob looks around at all the Japanese gift stuff, and buys a 
               little stuffed bunny. His phone rings as he's paying for it.

                                     BOB
                         Hello?

                         Oh, hi, Elaine.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         So, we got you on an earlier flight, 
                         but I really think you should think 
                         about staying for that talk show.

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                         Yeah, I'll stay.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Charlotte's foot X-rays are displayed on a big light box. An 
               older DOCTOR talks about them in Japanese to his younger 
               ASSISTANT as he wraps Charlotte's toes together. She doesn't 
               know what they're talking about.

               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

               Charlotte comes out where Bob waits with the little stuffed 
               bunny.

               Bob and Charlotte arrive back at the massive hotel, they 
               stroll in casually, she is carrying the stuffed rabbit in 
               her arm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob reclines in the big Japanese wooden tub, steam rises as 
               he is turning red. His phone rings. He dries his hands quickly 
               to reach it before it stops ringing.

                                     BOB

                         you... Did you get the carpet samples? 
                         I like the burgundy.

                         It's just carpet.

                         That's not what I'm talking about.

                         Why don't you just stay there, and 
                         you can have it everyday.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, come on.

                         I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, 
                         I'll talk to you later. Are you going 
                         to be Ok?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bob rides in the back of a cab.

                                     CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
                              (voice-mail message)
                         Hi Bob, it's Charlotte... how are 
                         you doing today?... I'm going to 
                         meet Charlie and those guys at this 
                         place called Orange around ten... 
                         come meet us if you get this...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               Bob's cab pulls up at an empty office building.

               INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               Bob looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map, wondering if 
               he's in the right place. It's quiet and looks like a generic 
               office building.

               He goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on 
               the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never 
               thought was there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ORANGE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               Lights strobe and Peaches' seedy "Fuck the Pain Away" booms 
               through the speakers.

               Tan JAPANESE STRIPPERS with platinum hair dance and hang 
               from a pole on a little platform.

               Bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of 
               place and empty.

               He looks over at a table of young AMERICAN INVESTMENT BROKERS. 
               He wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable.

               Charlotte shows up with Charlie and the other guys. She sits 
               down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill 
               me?' look.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How long have you been here?

               He looks at her like it's been forever. She smiles for 
               forgiveness.

               They look over and see a WEIRD GUY in the corner getting a 
               lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the 
               place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it.

               Through a beaded curtain, Charlie and Bambi get lap dances 
               in a dark corner of pillows.

               Charlotte looks at Bob.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         C'mon, let's go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOKYO STREETS - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses 
               them. They don't know why, but just make their way down an 
               empty side street. Little plastic cherry blossom decorations 
               hang above them.

                                     BOB
                         Where's your husband?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (like she's said it a 
                              million times)
                         Working.

                                     BOB
                         Do you ever see him?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (sorta)
                         Yeah.

                                     BOB
                         Do you know where we are?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No.

               She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake 
               "one-cup". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an 
               iced coffee.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Isn't it weird there are no street 
                         names in Tokyo... you'd think a city 
                         like this would have street names... 
                         you need a map to get anywhere... 
                         look, there are no signs...

               They keep walking, small figures on a little empty street.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY - NIGHT

               As they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. 
               It's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and 
               just a SLEEPING MAN sits in the back of the lounge, and a 
               snuggled up romantic JAPANESE COUPLE sit close to: Kelly, 
               the blonde actress, singing to them.

               She stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing "Nobody 
               Does It Better" with all her heart.

               Bob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying 
               to be invisible).


               FADE IN:

               INT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               Charlotte lies in bed. She picks up a photo next to the bed 
               as she dials the phone.-

               The picture is of her and John on their honeymoon. The phone 
               answers - it's a weird Japanese recording.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? 
                         I'm not sure...I'm going to go to 
                         Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you 
                         when I get back. Hope it's going 
                         good... I love you, bye.

               INT. TRAIN - DAY

               Charlotte watches the Japanese countryside go by out her 
               window.

               EXT. KYOTO - DAY

               Charlotte walks through a beautiful garden. She's a small 
               figure in the landscape.

               She approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding 
               procession. A young bride and groom in traditional kimono 
               walk under a parasol with their family.

               Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her 
               mother's hand. The young groom walks along with them.

               Charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the 
               temple and the wedding party. Her eyes well up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               She walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves.

               At the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine.

               At its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces 
               of paper tied to its branches. She sees Japanese people 
               writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. Charlotte 
               writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY

               Exciting music plays as the talk/game show starts.

               Bob, in an elegant suit, goes out to meet the HOST.

                                     TV HOST
                              (in Japanese)
                         We hear you're quite a golfer.

               A TRANSLATOR translates.

                                     BOB
                              (nodding)
                         I enjoy the sport.

               The Translator translates - four sentences longer and with 
               added enthusiasm.

               After a few questions the Host excitedly announces something 
               to the AUDIENCE in Japanese. They scream, the lights flash, 
               Bob has no idea what's going on.

               A cloud of smoke reveals the IRON CHEF, with feathered hair, 
               wearing an 18th century waistcoat.  A large red chef hat is 
               placed on Bob's head.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         They now have the competition for 
                         you with the Iron Chef.

               Bob looks around as a counter is pulled up to him and now 
               Bob and the Iron Chef are at dueling counters. The Host barks 
               instructions in Japanese, an apron with a stuffed animal 
               lobster on it is tied around Bob, the crowd cheers - there's 
               no way out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bob rides in the back of the presidential, looking out the 
               window at the city.

               He pulls a polaroid out of his pocket and looks at it. It's 
               Charlotte, peering over her shoulder with a little smile, 
               from their sake-drenched night at Nobu's compound.

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Melodramatic '70s Japanese music plays. Bob sits alone, hating 
               himself, at the bar. The redheaded Jazz Singer takes a break, 
               and a seat next to him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - MORNING

               In the harsh-morning light, Bob wakes up in his bed.

               He hears the Jazz Singer singing in the shower "Midnight at 
               the Oasis".

               Her red mane of hair passes frame as she ushers in room 
               service. She seems to have taken over the whole room. He 
               wants it all to go away. She walks off to the bathroom and 
               there's a knock at the door. Bob rushes to get it before she 
               can.

               He opens the door a crack, Charlotte looking sweet, is 
               standing there. Her hair is back in a pony-tail. Bob's just 
               wearing a towel around his waist, and his hair is sticking 
               up.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Rough night?

               He's not in the mood, he looks at her like he already hates 
               himself, doesn't need more help.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want 
                         to come walk around?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, but no, I can't right now.

               The singer starts singing again in the background.

               Charlotte gives Bob a look.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.

                                     BOB
                         I don't want to be.

               He watches Charlotte walk away down the beige hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob is walking down the crowded street looking for Charlotte, 
               when his cell phone rings.

                                     BOB

                         I couldn't hear you. How are you?

                                     LYDIA
                              (sighs)
                         Fine. Is it going ok?

                                     BOB
                         It's ok.

                                     BOB
                         What?

                         Do you want to talk to  Zoe?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.

                         Zoe, come say hello to your father...

               A little girl's voice shouts "No!" in the background.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         I guess she's busy.

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

               In the background the daughter calls for her Mommy over and 
               over and a dog starts barking.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Ok, well, travel safely. See you 
                         soon.

                                     BOB
                         Bye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ICHICAN SUSHI RESTAURANT - DAY

               Charlotte, with sunglasses on, leans against the wall as Bob 
               approaches.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan 
                         after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?

                                     BOB
                         No, we'll find something around here.

               She goes with him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHABU SHABU RESTAURANT - DAY

               Bob and Charlotte are seated at a big booth in a corny Shabu 
               Shabu restaurant.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         The Jazz singer? The red-head?

               Bob looks at her like- don't make it worse.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, I guess she's more around your 
                         age...  You guys could talk about 
                         things in common, like growing up in 
                         the fifties.

                                     BOB
                         You're a brat, wasn't there anyone 
                         else around to lavish you with 
                         attention?

               She scowls at him.

               The waitress brings them drinks- she pours beer slowly, and 
               turns on a pot on the table to cook their food.

               Charlotte looks at the menu - it is filled with photos of 
               different trays of meat. The waitress doesn't speak English.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I can't tell the difference?

               They have trouble ordering, but point to a picture on the 
               menu.

                                     BOB
                         We'll have two of these.

               He makes some small talk, she is bugged.

                                     BOB
                         What do you want to drink?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         A coke.

               He orders the drinks.

                                     BOB
                         So, where'd you go today.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Around.

               "This is the End" by The Doors starts playing on the stereo. 
               The waitress brings two huge trays of sliced raw beef. Steam 
               rises from the pot on the table.

               The song ends, and another Doors song comes on.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         They're not going to play the whole 
                         album, are they?

               They look across the table, over the steam and meat, at each 
               other- the whole thing is awful.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               In the darkness, under covers, Charlotte is woken up by a 
               loud fire alarm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               The fire alarm booms as the hotel guests and staff hurry out 
               of the hotel.

               Amidst the crowd of Hotel guests in their pajamas, Charlotte 
               finds Bob- he's wearing a kimono and slippers. She's in boxer 
               shorts and an undershirt and slippers.

                                     BOB
                         I'm sorry.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That lunch was the worst, huh.

               He laughs.

               She looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel 
               slippers.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         When are you leaving?

                                     BOB
                         Tomorrow.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (friendly)
                         I'm going to miss you.

                                     BOB
                         That's what you said the other night.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, I mean it more now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               and Charlotte, still in their pajamas, sit at their usual 
               spot at the bar, with the bartender, drinking cold sake. She 
               lights two cigarettes and passes one to him.

               A NEW JAZZ BAND is now playing. The SINGER is full of 
               enthusiasm as they start their stint at the Park Hyatt.

                                     NEW SINGER
                         Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and 
                         we're thrilled to be joining you 
                         this week, here at the NY bar in 
                         Shinjuku.

               He sings "Where or When" with all his heart.

               Now, old-timers there, Bob and Charlotte look at each other 
               and chuckle.

                                     SINGER
                         Jt seems we stood and talked like  
                         this before,   we looked at  each 
                         other in  the same way thenr   but  
                         I cant remember where or when...

               Bob and Charlotte sit there together.

                                     BOB
                         I don't want to go back tomorrow.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know. But, it doesn't last, you 
                         have to go back sometime.

                                     BOB
                         Why can't it last?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, it just doesn't, reality 
                         changes things....we can't stay here 
                         forever, unless maybe we started a 
                         Jazz band.

               (alt Charlotte dialog: I don't know it just doesn't, reality 
               changes things...and we can't stay here forever)

               He looks over at her.

               The singer continues Where or When, as they sit there 
               together, the view sparkling.

                                     SINGER (O.C.)
                         Somethings  that happen for the first 
                         time,   seem to be happening again 
                         and so it  seems we have met before,   
                         and laughed before,   and loved 
                         before,   but who knows where or 
                         when...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte, drunk in the elevator.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         54?

               He nods, she pushes 54 for him and 56 for herself.

               They look at each other across the empty elevator, both 
               leaning against the walls.

               The elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good-night. 
               They kiss like you would on the cheek- but it's closer to 
               their mouths. The door shuts- he missed his floor.

               The elevator continues up, and stops on her floor. They kiss 
               good-night again and she gets out before the door closes.

               He watches the door close on her as she makes her way down 
               the long beige hall.

                                                                  FADE OUT:


               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY

               A fax comes through the machine in the empty room.

               IT'S A NOTE AND CUTE DRAWING FROM JOHN -

               SEE YOU ON SATURDAY, I MISS YOU..."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY LOUNGE - DAY

               A sexy EXECUTIVE WOMAN asks Bob for a light. He looks at her 
               great legs as he lights her cigarette. He looks around, 
               keeping an eye out for Charlotte. The group of commercial 
               people arrive to see him off.

               He excuses himself for a moment and goes to a phone on a 
               little table in the corner.

               Bob picks up the house phone.

                                     RECEPTION (O.S.)
                         Hello? Yes?

                                     BOB
                         Hello, can I have room 5601.

                         One moment.

               Traditional Japanese music plays on hold.

                                     RECEPTION
                         I will connect you.

               Bob gets the room voice-mail.

                                     BOB
                         Uh...Hi, Charlotte... it's me, Bob... 
                         ok, I guess you're not there... wanted 
                         to say good-bye...

               He hangs up, feeling lame.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL RECEPTION -DAY

               Bob with his bags tries to call again. The commercial people 
               and hotel staff crowd around to help him, asking about his 
               stay.

                                     BOB
                         Charlotte?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi, Bob.

                                     BOB
                         I'm just leaving.... do you have my 
                         jacket?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.

                                     BOB
                         That'd be great.

                                     CHARLOTT
                         E Ok, see you in a second.

               A member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little 
               silver tray.

               Miss Kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in 
               traditional Japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do 
               with them and has to carry them.

               The Executive Woman from the bar walks up to him. He hangs 
               up the phone.

                                     BOB
                         0hr hi.

                                     EXEC WOMAN
                         You're leaving?

               She looks at him like, we could have had some fun.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

               He sees Charlotte come out of the elevator.

                                     BOB
                         I have to go, thanks, bye.

               He rushes over to Charlotte. She looks at his bag.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Just saying good-bye to everyone 
                         before you leave?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, no.

               She hands him his jacket.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks.

               She waits for him to say something more. He wants to tell 
               her he loves her, that she should come with him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's it?

               The concierge tells him his car is here.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You're leaving right now?

                                     BOB
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well... have a good flight.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (hurt)
                         Ok, bye.

               She walks away.

               A hotel manager asks Bob about his luggage, another asks if 
               he had a pleasant stay. Charlotte gets in the elevator to go 
               out, the doors close on her back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - DAY

               It's bright outside the main entrance. A presidential pulls 
               up and the automatic door opens. Bob squints as the Bellboy 
               in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk.

               INT. CAR - DAY

               In the backseat, Bob leans back on the little doily.

               The car pulls away.

               Around the corner, he looks down a crowded alley and sees 
               Charlotte's blonde hair.

                                     BOB
                         Can you pull over a second?

               The DRIVER, wearing white cloth gloves, pulls the car over 
               slowly. Bob tries to open the door'99 it won't open, he has 
               to wait for the automatic doors to open for him (slowly).

               EXT. TOKYO STREETS - DAY

               Bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw 
               Charlotte. The street is crowded with JAPANESE PEOPLE, and 
               different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light 
               rain).

               Music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some 
               promo going on with GIRLS handing out little cologne samples. 
               Bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, 
               and super tan JAPANESE KIDS.

               In the distance an umbrella moves to reveal Charlotte.

                                     BOB
                         CHARLOTTE!

               But she can't hear him over the loudspeaker. He rushes to 
               her.

               C.U. she turns and we see she is crying.

               The music swells. He embraces her, holding her close to him 
               in the crowd.

                                     BOB
                         Why are you crying?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (sincere)
                         I'll miss you.

               He kisses her, hugs her good-bye.

                                     BOB
                         I know, I'm going to miss you, too.

               He holds her close.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte watches Bob as he reaches his car, he turns and 
               looks at her.

               She smiles at him, and is lost in the crowd.

               Bob gets into his car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte walks with the crowd as they go on their way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - DAY

               Back in the Presidential, alone, Bob leans against the little 
               doily.  They drive off.

               He looks out the window, Bob's happy he's going home, he's 
               happy he came to Tokyo.

               Bob's P.O.V.-  Tokyo goes past his window.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

	OPENING TITLES

	SLOW MOTION.  STYLIZED.  TIGHT.

	The silhouette of a man and woman.  They are on a blacktop
	basketball court, playing a sexually-charged game of one-one-
	one.

	Sweat glistens.  Hands pull at clothes.  Hips bump and
	collide.  Eyes lock...

	TITLE CARD: "FIRST QUARTER" then "1981"

	BALDWIN HILLS

	EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - LATE MORNING

	An upper middle-class neighborhood, known as the Black
	Beverly Hills.  Big houses, green grass and Caddies in every
	other driveway.  The street is quiet, until --

				YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
		You wanna be Kareem?

	CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a
	basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven.  He
	sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger.

				QUINCY (CONT'D)
		All his big butt do is stand by the
		basket.

				JAMAL
		Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.

				KELVIN
		I'm gonna be like Dr. J.

				QUINCY
		I'ma be like my Dad.

				JAMAL
		He ain't a star or nothing.

				QUINCY
		I don't see none of your sorry daddies in
		the NBA.

				KELVIN
		Hey, look, Q.

	Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse
	All-Stars approaching from next door.  Walking in the kicks
	is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap
	pulled low.  A moving van is parked in the driveway.

				KELVIN (cont'd)
		Thought only girls were moving in.

				QUINCY
		That's what my Moms said.

				KELVIN
		I hope he can ball.

				JAMAL
		Bet he's a scrub.

	The Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway.

				KID
		Hey.

				QUINCY
		Hey.

				KID
		Can I play?

				QUINCY
		You nice?

				KID
		Yeah, I'm nice.

	Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then --

				QUINCY
		You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.

	Quincy tosses the Kid the ball.  The Kid pulls off the
	baseball cap.  Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown
	face and bright eyes.  She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years
	old.

				JAMAL
		Ah man, he is a girl.

				QUINCY
		Girls can't play no ball.

				MONICA
		Ball better than you.

	Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the
	driveway.

				QUINCY
			(whispering)
		What a dog.

	Monica shoots him a glare.

				JAMAL
		She heard you.

				QUINCY
		Nuh uh, they could only hear dog
		whistles.

	Monica starts to dribble.  Jamal whistles as he walks
	backwards, guarding her.  She throws up a shot.  IT'S AN
	AIRBALL.  Quincy and Jamal crack up.  Kelvin rolls his eyes.

	Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots.  Swish.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		One, zip.

	He rolls the ball to Monica.  She starts dribbling and again,
	Jamal just backs up with her.  She passes to Kelvin.  Jamal
	and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the
	basket.  Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.

	Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot.  It banks off
	the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.  The boys look at
	her in shock.  Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.

				MONICA
		One, up.

				QUINCY
		Lucky.

	Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.  He
	throws the ball back to Monica.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Two, one.

	Monica dribbles.  Jamal plays her a little tighter.  Monica
	bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.

				MONICA
		Two, up.

	Quincy can't believe it.  Kelvin cracks up.

				KELVIN
		Aaah, she dogged you.

				JAMAL
		Shut up.

	The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets
	for their teams.  Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is
	unable to stop her.  The score hits nine, nine.

	Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.

				QUINCY
		Point.

	Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.
	The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.

	Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the
	ball.  Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I got her.

	Quincy defends.  Monica smiles back at him.

				MONICA
		Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be
		the first girl in the NBA.

				QUINCY
		I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my
		cheerleader.

	Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket.
	Quincy stumbles, giving her a step.  Kelvin throws it back.

	Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up.
	In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving
	her off balance.

	THE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND,
	FACE-FIRST.  SHE GRABS HER CHEEK.  BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER
	FINGERS.

	The boys stand frozen.  Quincy stares down at her, his eyes
	wide with fear...and regret.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING

	Monica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes
	the blood from her face with a washcloth.

				GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Eeew.

	Her sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face.
	She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and
	painted nails.

	Her father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.

				NATHAN
		How are you feeling, munchkin?

	Monica nods.  He smiles.

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		Yeah, you're through.

				CAMILLE
		She needs to stop running around like a
		little boy.

				NATHAN
		She's alright.

				CAMILLE
		How is she alright looking the way she
		does?

				NATHAN
		Camille, she'll be fine.

	He gives Monica a wink, crosses away.  Monica pulls the
	washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood
	herself.

				CAMILLE
		I'll get some ice.

	She exits.  Lena shakes her head, follows.

	Monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the
	mirror.  TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK.
	Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left
	for this little girl to do.  She smiles.

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

	Quincy sits at the kitchen table, writing "I AM SORRY" in
	block letters across a homemade card.  His face is tight with
	concentration as he tries to write in a straight line.

	At the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store
	box to a cake dish.  She is 30, beautiful, with effort.  She
	smooths the frosting with a spoon.

	ZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer,
	enters.  He laughs.

				ZEKE
		Girl, who you trying to fool?

	Quincy looks up, smiles.  He quickly grabs a piece of
	crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke.

				QUINCY
		Alley-oop, Dad.

	Nona intercepts his pass.

				NONA
		Boy...

	She points him back to his card.  Quincy scowls, starts
	writing again.  Nona scoops some frosting on her finger,
	holds it up.

				NONA (cont'd)
		New neighbors.

	Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting
	off.

				ZEKE
		See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught
		me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me
		thinking I was getting a sister who could
		burn.

	Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss.  Quincy suddenly
	throws down his pencil in frustration.

				QUINCY
		I can't do this shit.

	Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.

				ZEKE
		Boy, what'd I tell you about using that
		word?

				QUINCY
			(sighs, then)
		"Can't" should never be in a man's
		vocabulary.

				ZEKE
		Why not?

				QUINCY
		Cause when you say can't, you ain't a
		man.

				ZEKE
		That's right.

				NONA
		Zeke.

				ZEKE
		What?
			(then)
		Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

	Nona just shakes her head.

				NONA
		We should head over.

				ZEKE
		Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a
		meeting.

				NONA
		With who?

				ZEKE
		Business folks.

				NONA
		You just got back from a four game road
		trip.

				ZEKE
		Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe
		two years left to play.  I'm just trying
		to put some things together for us.

	Zeke grabs his keys.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Later, Quincy.

				QUINCY
		Later, Dad.

	Zeke exits.  Nona leans against the counter, concerned.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Mom?

				NONA
		What?

				QUINCY
		We still have to go?

				NONA
			(beat)
		Yeah.

	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY



	Camille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes.  Monica and
	Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at
	each other.  A large bandage covers Monica's cheek.  Monica
	holds her card, Camille holds the cake.

				NONA
		...we moved back here when Quincy was
		about five, after Zeke was traded.
		Neighborhood was a little more mixed
		back then...

				CAMILLE
		Until the Black family down the street
		became the Black family next door.

				NONA
			(nods)
		Okay?

	Camille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair.  Monica
	moves her head.

				CAMILLE
		Well, thanks again.  This was really nice
		of you.

				NONA
		It was the least we could do.  And I love
		to cook.

	Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised.  She quickly hugs his
	face into her stomach.  Camille lights up.

				CAMILLE
		Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my
		friends' parties and things back in
		Atlanta.

				NONA
		You're a caterer?

				CAMILLE
		Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled
		and the girls get a little older, it's
		definitely something I want to do.
			(then)
		Since you love to cook, maybe it's
		something we can talk about.

	Quincy snickers.  Nona quickly changes the subject.

				NONA
		You know, girl, long as I've lived next
		door, I've never seen the inside of this
		house.

				CAMILLE
		Really?  Well, come on, then.

	Camille hands Monica the cake.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Honey, put this in the kitchen.

				NONA
		Help her, Quincy.

	Camille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and
	Quincy alone.  The two just stand there.

	Quincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it
	in his mouth.  Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop.

				QUINCY
		So...does it hurt?

				MONICA
		It's this big hole.  You could almost see
		bone.

				QUINCY
		For real?

				MONICA
		Uh huh.

	Quincy is impressed.

				QUINCY
		So how come you could play basketball?

				MONICA
		I just can.

				QUINCY
		I never knew a girl that could play.

				MONICA
		My Mom says she doesn't know where I come
		from 'cause I act different.

				QUINCY
		Your Dad play?

				MONICA
		He works at a bank.

				QUINCY
		My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says
		I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma
		play for them, too.  Same number and
		everything.

				MONICA
		I'm going to be number thirty-two, like
		Magic.

				QUINCY
		He's alright, but my Dad can take him.

				MONICA
		What was the most points your Daddy ever
		got in Junior High?

				QUINCY
		I don't know.  A lot.

				MONICA
		One time Magic scored forty-eight points,
		and they only had six minute quarters and
		he sat out the whole fourth.

				QUINCY
		You do act different.

				MONICA
		I don't care.

				QUINCY
		Well, if anybody bothers you, you could
		just tell me cause I run this street.

				MONICA
		I'd just tell my sister, Lena.

				QUINCY
		She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad
		showed me how to fight like Ali.

	He shows off a flurry of punches.

				MONICA
		So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."

	Monica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks
	and hand movements.  Quincy is impressed.

				QUINCY
		Bet you can't do this though.

	Quincy does a jump kick.  Monica does the same.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Okay, how bout this?

	Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel.  It
	looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake.
	The cake falls onto his head and shoulder.

	Monica doubles over, laughing.  Quincy is embarrassed.
	Camille and Nona rush back into the living room.

				CAMILLE
		Monica, what did you do?

				MONICA
		Nothing.

				CAMILLE
			(to Nona)
		Oh, all that work.

				NONA
		It's...it's okay.  Can I get a towel?

	Camille quickly crosses into the kitchen.  Quincy stares at
	the floor.

				QUINCY
		Sorry.

	Nona bends down, whispers in his ear.

				NONA
		No.  Good boy.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Monica sits between Lena's legs, grimacing, as Lena works a
	comb through her freshly washed, kinky hair.  Monica's head
	flops like a rag doll.  Her eyes are wet.

				MONICA
		Ow!

	Lena keeps tugging.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Ow, Lena!!!

	Monica punches her in the leg.

				LENA
		Ow!

	Lena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a
	yellow dress on a hanger.  Monica sees it and her face falls.

				MONICA
		Ah, Mom.

				CAMILLE
		I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your
		box of dresses under a pile of rags in
		the garbage.

	Monica sulks.  Lena cackles in her ear.  Camille has to
	laugh.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Child, pick up your lip.

				MONICA
		I hate it.

				CAMILLE
		Fine, you don't like this one, which one
		would you rather wear?

				MONICA
		Pants.

	Camille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door.

				CAMILLE
			(to Lena)
		When you're done can you make sure she
		brushes her teeth?

				LENA
		Are you okay?

				CAMILLE
		I just need to lay down.  I've been
		running around all day.

	Just then, Nathan enters.  He holds up two dress shirts as if
	it were a matter of life and death.

				NATHAN
		Which one for tomorrow?

				CAMILLE
		The blue.

				NATHAN
		You sure?

	Camille nods.  Nathan looks at both of them, then:

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		Can you iron both tonight just in case?

				CAMILLE
			(beat)
		Okay.

				NATHAN
		Thanks, sweetheart.

	He kisses her on the cheek, hands her the two shirts and
	crosses out.  Monica just watches.  Beat, then Camile turns
	back to her daughters.

				CAMILLE
		The boy next door is riding with you to
		school so you'll know somebody your first
		day.
			(to Lena)
		Hurry so she can go to sleep.

	Monica reacts, surprised.  Camille leaves.  Lena puts the
	comb back to Monica's hair.  Beat, then:

				MONICA
		Make it look nice, kay.

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Basketball posters, "Clippers" and USC memorabilia, a
	basketball globe light.

	Quincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his
	parents MAKING LOVE.  The sounds bring a smile to his face.

	Quincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear.  He moves to his
	window, sees Monica through her window directly across from
	his.  Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair.  Quincy
	kneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches.
	
	
	  EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - MORNING



	Quincy sits atop his BMX bike in front of Monica's house.  A
	basketball is tucked under his arm.

	Monica emerges, walking her banana-seater.  She is looking
	cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons.  A
	basketball sits in her back basket.

	Quincy is taken aback, stares at her.

				QUINCY
		You wanna be my girl?

	Monica blinks in surprise.  She thinks for a moment.

				MONICA
		What do I have to do?

				QUINCY
		I guess, you know, we play ball and we
		ride to school together.  And if you get
		mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.

				MONICA
		I don't like flowers.

				QUINCY
		Oh.

				MONICA
		How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever
		buy them.

				QUINCY
		Kay.

				MONICA
		Okay.

	An awkward beat between the new couple.  Finally --

				QUINCY
		I think we gotta kiss now.

				MONICA
		For how long?

				QUINCY
		Five seconds.

	The two glance around, then climb off their bikes and walk to
	the secluded area between their two houses.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Ready?

	Monica nods.  They lean in, eyes wide open, and touch lips.
	Quincy counts to five with his fingers.  They pull away,
	embarrassed, and walk back to the driveway.

	Monica lifts her bike from the ground and climbs on.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Wait.  Cause you're my girl now you
		gotta ride my bike.

				MONICA
		I want to ride my own bike.

				QUINCY
		My Dad always drives my Mom.

				MONICA
		So?

				QUINCY
			(impatient)
		So that means I have to ride with you.

	Monica doesn't move.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Come on.

				MONICA
		I don't have to do what you say.

				QUINCY
		Man, forget you then, stupid.

				MONICA
		You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for
		the worst team in the NBA.

	Quincy's face instantly clouds.

				QUINCY
		What?

				MONICA
			(laughs)
		Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

				QUINCY
		Shut up!

	He shoves her, knocking her off her bike.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I don't wanna be your boyfriend, you ugly
		dog!

	Monica leaps up, her dress now dirty.  She shoves him back.

				MONICA
		I don't want to be your girlfriend, big
		head!

	They grapple, then fall to the ground swinging...

								FADE TO:

	BLACK.

	FOOTAGE.  Men's NCAA Finals.  Michigan State against Indiana
	State.  Magic Johnson against Larry Bird.  Magic drives on
	Bird, hits a beautiful scoop shot.  He celebrates as he jogs
	back down court...

	TITLE CARD: "SECOND QUARTER" then "1988"



	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY



	A snarling Black cougar glares down from a large mural.  On

	the court below, a girl's basketball play-off game.

	The bleachers are almost half-full with a hyped crowd.  In
	the crowd are Monica's parents.  Her father is excited and
	vocal.  Her mom reads a book.  Also in the stands, the HEAD
	COACH OF THE TENNESSEE LADY VOLS, PAT SUMMIT.

	A fine-ass BROTHER leans in the doorway, sporting a letter
	jacket with an embroidered "Q" on the chest.  He gets as much
	attention as the game.  A couple of JUNIOR VARSITY
	CHEERLEADERS smile his way.

				CHEERLEADERS

		Mama.

	On the floor, MONICA, dribbles down court.  Just EIGHTEEN,
	her athletic figure has a few curves, but her loose jersey
	does little to show it off.  Her hair is a mess and her knees
	are dark with bruises.  A small scar is visible on her cheek.

	She whips a no-look, around the back pass to a cutting
	TEAMMATE under the basket, who scores.  The crowd cheers.

	Monica defends the opposing point guard like a gnat.  She
	knocks the ball loose and grabs it up.  She goes for a lay-up
	and the opposing guard steps in front of her.  Monica crashes
	into her, knocking both to the floor.

	A WHISTLE.

				REFEREE
		No basket!  Offensive foul, number thirty-
		two.

	Monica leaps up.

				MONICA
		What?  She wasn't set!

	The referee ignores her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		She was still moving!

	From the sideline, COACH HISERMAN waves frantically.

				COACH HISERMAN
		Monica!  Let it go!

	Monica stares down the ref as she jogs back on defense.

	The opposing guard drives the lane and puts up a shot.
	Monica leaps and blocks it with a taunting scream.  A
	WHISTLE.

				REFEREE
		Technical foul!  Number thirty-two.

	Coach Hiserman slams down his clipboard.  Monica charges the
	referee.  A teammate grabs at her but she pushes her off.

				MONICA
		For what?

				REFEREE
		Taunting.

				MONICA
		Taunting?!

				COACH HISERMAN
		Sub!

				MONICA
		Man, you suck!

	The referee whips back around, whistle in mouth.  Coach
	Hiserman grabs her arm and pulls her off the court.

				COACH HISERMAN
		Sit down and shut up.

	Monica slams down in a chair, sweat pouring, hands clenched.
	Her mom watches from the stands, completely embarrassed.  The
	brother in the doorway turns, leaves.

	Monica looks up at the clock.  SIX MINUTES LEFT IN THE THIRD
	QUARTER.

								   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATE DAY

	Monica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats
	on, her face dry.  She glances up at the clock.  TWENTY
	SECONDS LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.  Her team's up by SIX.

	Her teammates dribble out the clock.  The BUZZER SOUNDS and
	they dance across the floor.  Monica looks up in the stands.
	COACH SUMMIT IS GONE.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

	Camille, now forty-three, stands at the stove stirring a pot
	of gumbo.  Lena, 21, and pretty, stands next to her, holding
	a handful of plates and silverware.

				CAMILLE
		...and if you want a thicker base, you
		can cut in a potato or just use a little
		flour.

				LENA
		But you use potato?

	Camille nods as they cross into:

	INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	At the table, Monica is in mid-conversation with her dad.
	Camille and Lena start setting the table.

				MONICA
		Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.

				NATHAN
		And what am I supposed to say to the man?

				MONICA
		The coach from Tennessee was there and he
		has me riding the bench.

				NATHAN
		You lost your head.

				MONICA
		I was just showing emotion.

				CAMILLE
		So that means it's alright for you to act
		like that?

				LENA
			(to Monica)
		What'd you do?

				MONICA
			(dismissive)
		nothing.

				CAMILLE
		I don't know why I keep hoping you'll
		grow out of this tomboy thing.

				MONICA
		I won't.  I'm a lesbian.

	Lena chokes on her drink, cracks up.

				CAMILLE
		That's not funny

				MONICA
		Well, that's what you think, isn't it?
		Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an
		apron...

				CAMILLE
		Watch your mouth.

	Nathan quickly jumps in, tries to clean things up.

				NATHAN
		Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's
		time to start thinking about other things
		besides basketball.

				MONICA
			(taken aback)
		What?

				NATHAN
		You only have one game left and you
		haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I
		wanted it as bad as you did, but we have
		to face reality.

				MONICA
		The coach from USC is going to be at the
		championship.

				NATHAN
		I know.  But chances are...

				MONICA
		Chances are there's still a chance.

	Nathan nods.  She can always soften her dad, but not her mom.

				CAMILLE
		If you'd just listen for once, you'd
		realize you have a lot more going for
		yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty
		if you put a comb to your head.  I mean,
		why walk around with your hair looking
		like "whodunit"...?

	As her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window.

	OUTSIDE, QUINCY and a GIRL lean against a car parked at the
	curb, slobbing each other down.

	Just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is
	a brother who drank his chocolate milk.  HE IS ALSO THE
	BROTHER WHO WAS WATCHING MONICA'S GAME FROM THE GYM DOORWAY.

	Monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears...

	EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - SAME TIME

	FELICIA, 17, can't get enough of Quincy's lips.

				QUINCY
		Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.

	She keeps kissing him.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		And my mom's about to be home.

				FELICIA
		So I'm not good enough to meet your mom?

				QUINCY
		Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you
		up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.

				FELICIA
			(kissing him again)
		That's a lot of beating.

	She finally lets go, and slides into her car.  Quincy watches
	her go with a cocky-ass smile.
	

	  INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT



	A frenzied crowd from floor to ceiling watches Quincy explode

	across the court.  He is the complete point guard - hitting
	from the outside, driving to the hoop, no-look passes,
	playing tight D.'

	His father, Zeke, now 39, stands on the sideline.  His muscle
	has softened a little over the last five years of retirement.

	Monica sits alone in the bottom row, holding a basketball.
	She wears jeans and a T-shirt and her hair is pulled back in
	a simple pony-tail.

	Quincy does a killer cross-over move and his Defender falls
	down.  He lays up the ball, then taunts the player he just
	poster-ized.  Behind Monica, TWO GIRLS smack each other
	excitedly.  One of them, SHAWNEE, 17, pretty, big chest,
	slides down into the empty seat next to her.

				SHAWNEE
		Hey, girl.

				MONICA
		Hey.

				SHAWNEE
		Your hair looks so cute like that.

	Monica knows she's full of shit, doesn't respond.

				SHAWNEE (cont'd)
		So...you know who Q's asking to the
		Spring Dance?

				MONICA
		No.

				SHAWNEE
		C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's
		been creeping?

				MONICA
		There's so many I just can't keep track.

				SHAWNEE
		Well, can you give him this for me?

	Shawnee holds out a folded note.  Monica doesn't take it.

				MONICA
		Give it yourself.

				SHAWNEE
		I don't wanna look fast.
			(drops it in Monica's lap)
		Thanks, girl.

	She slides back to her seat.  Monica shakes her head, turns
	back to the game.

	Quincy dives for a loose ball.  Shawnee clutches her friend.

				SHAWNEE (cont'd)
		Good Lord, look at that ass.  I just want
		to lick the sweat off it.

	Monica takes in his tight body.  He does look good.  Quincy
	jogs back down court and flashbulbs go off...

								  MATCH CUT TO:

	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

	Flashbulbs.  Quincy stands with his dad, his sweat still
	fresh, talking to a reporter named JIM.

				JIM
		Quincy, word has it you might make the
		jump the NBA.

				ZEKE
		Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's
		college bound with or without basketball.

				JIM
		You could make a career by telling me
		where.

				ZEKE
		Gotta wait til the press conference.

				JIM
		But you'd love for him to play at USC,
		like you did.

				ZEKE
		I'd love for him to get a good education.
			(then)
		That's it.

	Jim crosses away.  Zeke puts an affectionate arm around his
	son as they walk toward the locker room.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		We should have another talk with Coach
		Carril at Princeton.

				QUINCY
		Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is
		going all the way.

				ZEKE
		I don't care about the team.  I care
		about the school.

				QUINCY
		Didn't we already have this conversation?

	Zeke sighs, then:

				ZEKE
		You played good.  I was proud of you.

	Quincy smiles wide.

				QUINCY
		Yeah?
			(then)
		So you up for a game later?

				ZEKE
		I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

				QUINCY
		You don't wanna hurt your back.

				ZEKE
			(smiles)
		Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting.
		Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.

				QUINCY
		You work too hard, Pop.

				ZEKE
		Let's hope I can say the same about you
		one day.

	Quincy watches his dad move toward the doors, stopping once
	to give an autograph.  Zeke passes Monica, entering.

				MONICA
		Hey, Mr. M.

				ZEKE
		Hey, Miss Baller.

	He exits.  Monica approaches Quincy.

				MONICA
		Way to hoop.

				QUINCY
		I know this.  What do you want?

				MONICA
		A ride home.

				QUINCY
		Your legs don't look broke.

				MONICA
		Look, big head, I'll be at your car.

				QUINCY
		Guess "please" would be a stretch.

				MONICA
			(dryly)
		Please.

	  INT. QUINCY'S JEEP - NIGHT



	Silence as Quincy wheels his Jeep Wrangler toward home.
	Monica sits in the passenger seat, basketball in lap.  She
	pulls Shawnee's note from her pocket.  Quincy glances it
	over.


				QUINCY
		What's that?

				MONICA
		Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give
		to you.

				QUINCY
			(thinks)
		Big-ass titties?

	Monica shoots him a disgusted look.  Quincy reaches out.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Give it here.

	Monica leans away, reads aloud.

				MONICA
		"Q.  I think you are so fine and I've
		been wanting to get with you.  Let me
		take you to the Spring Dance and I
		promise I'll leave you satisfied."

	Monica laughs in disbelief.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		What a ho.

				QUINCY
		Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she
		wants to get with me.

				MONICA
		She's a ho cause she's sending her
		coochie through the mail.

				QUINCY
		And?

				MONICA
		And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a
		nice guy and I wanna get to know you
		better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."

				QUINCY
		So she's honest.

				MONICA
		Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I
		guess you'll stick your dick in anything.

				QUINCY
		Didn't know you cared so much.

				MONICA
		I don't.

				QUINCY
		So who you going to the dance with,
		Spalding?

				MONICA
		Who's Spalding?

	Quincy looks down at the SPALDING BASKETBALL in her lap and
	cracks up.  Monica glares.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Fuck you, Quincy.

				QUINCY
		See, that's why you ain't getting
		recruited.

				MONICA
		Who said I'm not getting recruited?

				QUINCY
		Your hot-ass temper.

	Monica points to the scar on her cheek.

				MONICA
		I'm not the one who put this scar here.

				QUINCY
		God, here we go.

				MONICA
		When we were eleven years old cause he
		was about to lose.

	Quincy turns, faces her.

				QUINCY
		That's it, give it your best shot.

				MONICA
		Would you watch the damn road?

				QUINCY
		I mean it, give it your best shot, cause
		I'm tired of you holding that over my
		head.

				MONICA
		I'm warning you, don't tempt me.

				QUINCY
		I'm warning you.  You don't stall that
		bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.

	Quincy pulls his Jeep into his driveway.

				MONICA
		Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk
		smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But
		because I'm a female, I get told to calm
		down and act like a "lady".  I'm a
		ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.

				QUINCY
		With a jacked-up attitude.

				MONICA
		Didn't know you cared so much.

				QUINCY
		I don't.

				MONICA
		Good.

	Monica slams out of the Jeep and walks across the lawn to her
	house.  Quincy exits his ride.
	
	  INT. MCCALL HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - SHORT TIME LATER



	Quincy steps inside, drops his bag on the floor.  His mom,
	Nona, approaches from the dining room.

				QUINCY
		What's up, Moms.

	Nona holds up a large hoop earring.

				NONA
		What is this?

				QUINCY
		Uh, your earring?

				NONA
		I look like some hoochie to you?  I
		found it on your floor.

				QUINCY
		What are you doing in my room?

	Quincy crosses into:

	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Nona follows.  Quincy pulls open the fridge, grabs a couple
	of slices of cold pizza.

				NONA
		Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass
		girls.

				QUINCY
		We were just studying.

				NONA
		I'm not playing with you, these girls are
		looking to get you caught.  They see you,
		they see dollar signs.

				QUINCY
		Okay.

				NONA
		You hearing me?

				QUINCY
		I've been hearing you.

	Nona eyes her son, then lets up.  She gives him a kiss.

				NONA
		How was your game?

				QUINCY
		Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and
		still undefeated.

				NONA
		Still the man.

				QUINCY
		Yup.

	Nona smiles, starts back the kitchen.

				NONA
		Where's your dad?

				QUINCY
		Said he'd be home later.

				NONA
		Later when?

				QUINCY
		I don't know, he had a meeting or

	Quincy exits to his room.

	Nona angrily rolls her hair as Zeke undresses.

		shake.

				NONA
		At one in the morning?

				ZEKE
		I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a
		clock just so my wife doesn't get an

				NONA
		I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about
		to come second to this bullshit scouting
		job.

	Zeke looks at her, offended.

				NONA (cont'd)
		I didn't mean it like that.

				ZEKE
		Yeah.

				NONA
		I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found
		time for your family.
		You should see the tramps coming after
		Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...

				ZEKE
		I have.

	A beat.

				NONA
		You said you'd think about going back to
		get your degree.

				ZEKE
		No, you said I should get my degree.  I
		like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's
		gonna lead to a spot in the front office.
		Til then, don't worry, there's just
		enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci
		and gold.

	Livid, Nona pulls off her gold bracelet, throws it at him.

				NONA
		Fine, then how many nights home is that?

				ZEKE
		Keep your voice down.

	She grabs a pair of gold earrings from her jewelry box, nails
	him.

				NONA
		How about now?  I got a week yet?

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, as his parents

	He rolls out of bed, pulls on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt.
	He moves to his window, pulls it open and climbs out...

	EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy crosses the grass to Monica's window, knocks quietly.

	Long beat, then Monica sleepily stumbles to her window,
	wearing boxers and a tank top.  She pushes it open and Quincy
	pulls himself through...

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Now a routine, Monica tosses Quincy one of her pillows and

	Monica sits on the floor between Lena's legs, as Lena puts
	Monica's hair in cornrows.

				LENA
		That too tight?

		No.

		Always on my ass, anyway.

		So what's going on with the Spring Dance?
		You have a date yet?

		Cougars!

	As Monica moves to center court, she glances up at the USC
	Coach, then at Quincy.

	Monica takes a deep breath as she lines up for the opening
	tip.  An opposing player suddenly bumps her out of position.
	Monica glares at her, but just moves over.

	The ball is tossed up...

	Fourth quarter.  One minute left.  Cougars down three.

	Monica dribbles down court, bouncing with confidence as her
	opponent plays her tight.

	Monica zips a no-look pass to a teammate, who lays it up.
	Quincy punches one of his friends - "Oh shit!"  She is having
	the game of her life.

	On the defensive end, Monica steals the ball.  She drives the
	length of the court, lays it up between two defenders.  The
	crowd is hyped.

	Twenty seconds left, up by one.  Monica hounds the opposing
	guard as she brings up the ball.
	Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose.  As she
	goes for the ball, a WHISTLE.

	Monica catches herself, turns the word "shit" into a
	frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref.

	Monica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists.  The
	girl hits the first one.  Then, she hits the second.

	With ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court
	and throws up a prayer.  EVERYONE IS ON THEIR FEET AS THE
	BALL SPINS AROUND THE RIM.  AND THEN...IT POPS OUT.  An
	opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice
	but to foul her.

	Monica has just fouled out.  She walks to her bench and drops
	down.  She buries her face in a towel and sobs.

	everything Monica has been hiding.  He checks out her frame,
	smiles.

				JASON
		Your sister wasn't lying.

	He crosses to the coat check, leaving her alone.

	ANGLE ON

	Quincy, who glances over from the middle of the dance floor,
	and abruptly stops.  He stares at Monica in shock.

				QUINCY
		Oh...shit.

	Quincy starts off the floor as a new song kicks in.

				SHAWNEE
		Q, I like this song...

	ANGLE ON

	Monica, sees Quincy approaching in his suit.  She quickly
	steadies herself on her heels, brushes a curl from her face.

				QUINCY
		See you made it.

				MONICA
		Yeah.

				QUINCY
		You don't look half-bad.

				MONICA
		You either.

	Jason returns.  Quincy looks at him, surprised.

				JASON
		What's up, Black.  I'm Jason.

				QUINCY
		Q.

	Shawnee suddenly steps up, slides her arms around Quincy.

				SHAWNEE
		Dang, girl, I didn't know Nike made
		dresses.

	Monica looks at Shawnee, wrapped around Quincy.  She can't
	believe it.

				MONICA
		Guess we'll see you later.

	Monica heads into the crowd with her college man.  Quincy
	watches her go.

	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATER

	Monica sits at a table with Jason.  His arm lays casually
	across the back of her chair.  Monica sits upright, stiff.

				JASON
		So, you like school?

	Monica smiles nervously, nods.

				JASON (cont'd)
		Yeah, high school was cool.  I don't
		remember sisters being as fine as you,
		though.

	Monica just holds that nervous smile.

				JASON (cont'd)
		So what do you like studying?

				MONICA
		Gym.

	He waits for more, but nothing comes.

				JASON
		I'm an English major.  You like English?

				MONICA
		Sort of.

				JASON
		Careful.

				MONICA
		Huh?

				JASON
		That was two words.

	Monica ducks her head, embarrassed.  Jason laughs.

				JASON (cont'd)
		Girl, how come you're so stressed?

				MONICA
		Sorry.

				JASON
		I mean, I'm having a good time with
		you...

	His arm slides off the back of her chair and onto her
	shoulders.

				JASON (cont'd)
		So tell me what I have to do to make you
		have a good time with me.

				MONICA
		My mouth is kinda dry.

				JASON
		Then I'll get you some punch.

	He stands, then.

				JASON (cont'd)
		Just don't jet while I'm gone and leave a
		glass slipper behind.

	Monica's face lights up.  Jason smiles.

				JASON (cont'd)
		There we go.

	He crosses away to the refreshment table.  Monica smiles
	wider, leans back in her chair with her legs splayed.  She
	catches herself and quickly crosses them.

	A couple of guys pass by and check her out.  Monica smiles
	wider.  Quincy steps up, holding two cups of punch.

				QUINCY
		Hey.

				MONICA
		Hey.

				QUINCY
		You having fun?

				MONICA
		Yeah.

				QUINCY
		Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.
			(beat)
		So who is this clown?

				MONICA
		He ain't Spalding.

				QUINCY
		Guess not.

				MONICA
		So you took Shawnee, huh?

	The DJ puts on "Make It Last Forever" by Keith Sweat.
	Couples move to the dance floor.

				QUINCY
			(embarrassed)
		You know, it was late and she asked...

				JASON
		You want to dance?

	Jason stands behind her chair.  Monica smiles shyly.

				MONICA
		Sure.

	Jason puts down her cup of punch, takes her hand, leads her
	to the dance floor.

	Quincy just shakes his head, then crosses to his table, grabs
	Shawnee's hand.

				QUINCY
		C'mon.

	He pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor.

	ANGLE ON

	Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently
	guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax.

	Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in
	closer.  Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands
	down his neck.  The heat from bodies grows.

	Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each
	other's eyes.  They start to look away but find they can't.
	Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel
	each other.  Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight.

	Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his
	hands lower down Shawnee's back.  The music continues...

	INT. JASON'S CAR - NIGHT

	Jason and Monica are parked up on Mulholland Drive.  LL Cool
	J's "I Need Love" plays on the tape deck.

	Jason has his arm around Monica, ready to make his move.

				MONICA
			(rattling)
		Freshman year, my free throw percentage
		was fifty-one percent, cause I was
		shooting it like a jump shot.

	Jason leans in, kisses her bare shoulder.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Um...but then sophomore year I was
		shooting seventy-five percent from the
		line.

	Jason kisses her neck.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		...uh, by keeping my feet set and really
		following through.

	Jason goes in for the slam dunk.  Kisses Monica on the lips.
	It's the first time she's really been kissed.  Jason pulls
	away, smiles.

				JASON
		That was nice.

				MONICA
		Uh-huh.

				JASON
		Your sister told me hands off, but I
		can't help myself...

	Jason leans in.  Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some
	more.  Monica tries to follow his practiced lips.

	Jason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down.  His
	hand moves across her breast.  Monica's eyes pop open.

				MONICA
		Wait...

				JASON
		Shh.  It's okay.

	Naive and inexperienced, Monica shuts her eyes tight.

								   DISSOLVE TO:
								
								
	  E WRIGHT HOUSE -NIGHT



	Jason's car pulls off, Monica slowly moves to her front door.

	She looks in the living room window.  Her mom is asleep in a
	chair, trying to wait up.

	Monica catches her reflection in the window.  She glares at
	her made-up face, then wipes at her mouth with her hand.

	She steps back , walks to her bedroom window.  She pulls it
	open, kicks off her heels and climbs through.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Monica moves to her bed and drops down.  She sits motionless
	for a beat, then suddenly feels something beneath her.  She
	reaches for it.  IT'S A LETTER FROM THE USC ATHLETIC
	DEPARTMENT.  Monica stares at it in her hands...

	Light suddenly cuts through the darkness.  Monica turns and
	is surprised to see Quincy standing in the middle of his
	room, pulling off his jacket.  Monica moves to her window,
	pulls it open.

				MONICA
		Psst.

	Quincy looks over.  Beat.  Then he climbs out of his window,
	drops down.

	EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

				MONICA
		Early night for you, isn't it?

				QUINCY
		I was about to ask you the same thing,
		going out with a college boy and all.

	Monica doesn't respond.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		So where'd you go after?

				MONICA
			(beat)
		Mulholland Drive.

				QUINCY
		Figures.

				MONICA
		So what dead-end street did you and
		Shawnee hit?

				QUINCY
		None of your business.

				MONICA
		Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left
		you satisfied.

				QUINCY
		That what you think?

	Monica shrugs.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Little after you left, I told Shawnee it
		was time to go and I drove her ass
		straight home.  And after she told me I
		was the dumbest brother in the world, I
		took off.

				MONICA
		Why?

				QUINCY
		Cause I don't just stick my dick in
		anything.

	Monica takes this in.

				MONICA
		I was sitting in Jason's ride with him
		kissing on me and feeling on me and it
		was really bugging me cause I couldn't
		remember how many offensive boards I had
		in the championship.  And then I guess
		she got tired of me sort of accidentally
		kneeing him in the balls.

	Beat, then Quincy cracks up.  Monica laughs with him.

				QUINCY
		Four.

				MONICA
		What?

				QUINCY
		You had four offensive rebounds.

	Monica stares at him, surprised.  She thinks.

				MONICA
		Hold up for a second.

	Monica disappears back inside.  Beat, then she re-appears.
	She climbs out her window, drops down.  Quincy looks at her.

	She holds out the envelope from USC.

				QUINCY
		When'd you get this?

				MONICA
		It was on my bed when I came in.
			(then)
		Can you just...?

				QUINCY
			(beat)
		You sure?

	Monica nods.  Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the
	grass.  Monica sits down beside him.  He tears open the
	envelope and pulls out the letter.

	Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in
	his face.  Quincy finally looks up.  Expressionless.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Damn girl...

	Monica's face falls.  And then, a slow smile spreads across
	Quincy's face.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		They want you.

	Monica grabs the letter, reads.  Her head just drops as a
	tidal wave of relief washes over her.

	Quincy smiles.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Congratulations.

	Monica looks up, cheesing.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I'm gonna be there, too.  I'm announcing
		tomorrow.

				MONICA
		I knew it.

	Monica can't contain her excitement.  Without thinking, she
	gives Quincy a kiss.  They pull away, then break into nervous
	laughter.

				QUINCY
		What was that about?

				MONICA
		I know, right?

	But they both want more.  They lean in, kiss deeply.  They
	fall back on the grass.  And kiss.  And kiss.

	Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up.  Quincy follows,
	instantly apologetic.  Monica stares at him, then to his
	surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with
	her finger.

	Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie.  He
	nervously unbuttons his shirt.  He fumbles with the last two
	buttons.

	Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self-
	conscious.  Quincy can't keep his eyes off her.

	He pulls off his pants.  Monica glances down and her eyes
	widen.  She looks scared to death.  Quincy smiles softly,
	leans in and gently kisses her.  She relaxes.  They lay down.

	Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom.  His hands shake
	as he puts it on.  They stare at each other as he moves on
	top of her.

	Quincy pushes inside her.  She flinches back in pain.  Quincy
	immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.

				QUINCY
			(softly)
		You want to stop?

	Monica shakes her head.  Quincy pushes inside again.  He
	looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her
	tears...

	TITLE CARD: "THIRD QUARTER"

	INT. USC - CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

	Championship banners hang from the ceiling.

	TWELVE YOUNG WOMEN sit on the first two rows of bleachers.
	The eight upperclassmen kick back in the second row,
	comfortable, confident.  Monica and the three other freshmen
	sit in front of them, jiggling nervously.

	COACH MILLER stands in front of the team.

				COACH MILLER
		I don't know some of you very well yet,
		and you don't know me because I'm still
		being nice to you.

	Laughter from the upperclassmen.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		But my philosophy is simple. Hard work
		and sacrifice.
		There's a lot of basketball history and
		pride here at USC, but just putting on
		the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a
		great player.  Hard work and sacrifice
		makes you a great player.  What you were
		doesn't matter anymore.  For the first
		time in your life, you won't be the best.
		You'll be going up against women that are
		bigger and stronger and better than you
		ever imagined.  So the question is, how
		will you respond?  Well, your answer
		better be hard work and sacrifice because
		that's the only way you're gonna make it
		through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and
		I teach it, "There is only one way to
		succeed at anything and that is to give
		everything."

	Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in.
	Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions.
	Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock
		curfew, no exceptions.  Always be on
		time, no exceptions.  Attend every class,
		no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no
		getting pregnant.  And finally, respect
		yourselves, respect your coaches and
		respect your teammates, right Sidra?

	SIDRA, senior point guard, nods from the second row.

				SIDRA
		That's right, Coach.

				COACH MILLER
		By the end of this year some of you will
		hate me...

	The upperclassmen crack up.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Some of you will want to go home...

				UPPERCLASSMEN
			(cat-calling)
		Cree!

	CREE, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly.  Coach
	Miller smiles.

				COACH MILLER
		But I guarantee you, if you work hard and
		sacrifice, all of you will be better
		basketball players and better people.

	Monica nods, accepting the challenge.

	EXT. TRACK - EARLY MORNING

	It's cold, it's dark.  It's six a.m.

	The team pounds down the track, pushing through a two-mile
	run.  Monica and her freshman teammate/roommate SHAYLA, 18,
	breathe heavily from the back of the pack.

	From the sideline.

				COACH MILLER
		Let's go, freshmen, you're getting
		spanked!

	Monica sucks it up, runs faster.  She reaches the middle of
	the pack, then runs out of gas.  She drops back to the rear.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Monica, I'm putting you on my Wizard of
		Oz team.  No brains, no courage and no
		heart!

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

	Defensive drills.  One by one, players crouch low and move
	backwards down the sideline.  ZVETTE, a junior guard, hustles
	through the drill.

				COACH MILLER
		Way to work, Zvette.

	Monica starts the drill.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Get lower, Monica, move your feet.

	Monica grimaces as she squats lower.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		I said lower!

	Coach Miller stops her, squats down low beside her.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		This is low, got it?  Offense sells
		tickets, defense wins games!

	Monica starts again.

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

	The team stands along the baseline.  Monica stands right
	below the free throw line.

	TONI, 6'4", 200 pound senior, drives the lane.  Monica steps
	in front of her, and is slammed to the floor.  She lays still
	for a moment, stunned by the impact.  Laughter from the
	baseline.

				SIDRA
		Dag, you took her out, T.

	Teammates SANDRA and LISA crack up.

				SANDRA
		I think she just said "Mommy."

				LISA
		No, she said "mammary."

				COACH MILLER
		Monica, you trying to tell me you can't
		take a little challenge?

	Monica crawls to her feet.

				MONICA
		I can take it.

				COACH MILLER
		This time get your feet set.

	Monica moves back into position.  Toni drives at her again.
	Monica steps in front of her, braces herself.  Toni slams
	into her and she hits the floor.  Monica blinks back the pain
	as she pops back up.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Next!

	Monica wobbles back to the sideline.

	INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE DAY

	The team is spread out, lifting weights.  Monica lies on a
	weight bench, her arms shaking as she struggles to bench
	press fifty-pounds.  Sidra stands behind her, spotting.

				SIDRA
		You got it, c'mon, lift!

	Monica lifts it with Sidra's help.

				SIDRA (cont'd)
		That's it.

				MONICA
		Coach hates me, doesn't she?

				SIDRA
		She hates all freshmen.

	Monica scowls, discouraged.

				MONICA
		What's up with that?

				SIDRA
		Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't
		think just cause we play the same
		position we have to compete with each
		other.  We're teammates, okay?

				MONICA
		Thanks, Sidra.

				SIDRA
		Besides.  I've been starting point the
		last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb-
		ass freshman is taking my spot.

	Sidra walks off, leaving Monica with the bar on her chest.
	Finally, she has to drop the weight to the floor.

	EXT. USC CAMPUS - LATE MORNING

	Monica and Quincy walk to class, his arm draped casually
	across her shoulders.  Quincy gets looks and smiles.  Monica
	just looks exhausted.

				MONICA
		You finish the reading for E-con?

				QUINCY
		Yeah.

				MONICA
		What'd it say?

				QUINCY
		Basically broke down how I'm gonna make
		mad loot in the NBA, me being such a
		limited commodity and all.

				MONICA
		Whatever, big head.

	Quincy laughs.  TWO GIRLS pass by, smile.

				GIRL #1
		Hey, Q-man, you gonna take us to the
		Final Four?

				QUINCY
		We'll see.

				GIRL #2
		We'll be watching.

	The girls continue on.  Monica looks at Quincy.

				QUINCY
		What?

				MONICA
		You do see me standing here, right?

				QUINCY
		I can't be nice to a fan?

				MONICA
		Fine, Quincy.

				QUINCY
		I can't help girls coming up to me.

				MONICA
		I said fine.

	Quincy looks at her sulking.  He suddenly pulls her down onto
	the nearby lawn, and cradles her.

				QUINCY
		It's okay, little baby.

				MONICA
			(struggling)
		Quit.

	Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her.  Students pass by,
	laugh.

				QUINCY
		Shhh.  Daddy's here.

	Monica finally cracks up.

				MONICA
		You're such a punk.

	He gives her a kiss.

				QUINCY
		All these girls...you're the only one I
		know who's for real.

	Monica smiles, kisses him back.

				MONICA
		Always.

	 INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING



	A heated scrimmage between the women's "A" team (the starting
	five) and "B" team (five who want to be starting).  Monica
	runs point for the "B" team, playing opposite Sidra.


	Sidra is all over Monica, slipping in cheap shots, but Monica
	starts to come on.  She does a quick cross-over and loses
	Sidra.  She dishes off to Shayla, who scores.

				COACH MILLER
		Sidra!  You feel like playing any "D"?

	Sidra scowls as she runs down court.  She gets a pass in the
	corner, tires to make a move but Monica slaps the ball loose.

	Monica grabs it, drives to the three-point line, puts up the
	shot.  SWISH!  Monica stays posed, with her arm up.

	Sidra takes advantage, sprints back down court.  She get the
	long pass, lays it up.  Coach Miller blows her whistle.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Monica!  Get over here.

	Monica jogs over, sheepish.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		While you're so busy posing, your man
		just scored!

	Monica drops her head.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Show me again.

				MONICA
		What?

				COACH MILLER
		You love to pose so much, let's see it
		again.

	Beat, then Monica holds up her arm like she just shot the
	ball.  Snickers from her teammates.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		I want you to stand like that for the
		rest of practice.

				MONICA
		Coach...

				COACH MILLER
		I want you to stand like that until
		you're sick of it because I don't ever
		want to see it again, you hear me?
			(then)
		Dora, take her spot.

	DORA, freshman, jogs onto the court.  Coach Miller blows her
	whistle and the scrimmage resumes.

	Monica stands alone on the sideline, posing, and feeling like
	an asshole.

	INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

	Monica sits on the bench in front of her locker, dressing
	after the shower.  Shayla sits next to her.

	Nearby, Lisa and Sandra apply make-up in the mirror.  Zvette
	passes by, already dressed.  Lisa turns.

				LISA
		Z, I know you're gonna shower first.

				ZVETTE
		I don't smell bad.

				SANDRA
		And you wonder why your ass sits alone on
		the bus.

	Cree glances over from another sink, as she snaps the chain
	on her CROSS NECKLACE.

				CREE
		You guys curse too much.

				SANDRA
		Since when is "ass" a curse?

	MAEYEN walks past.

				MAEYEN
		Whoa, it's as big as yours.

	They crack up.  Cree just shakes her head.  Two TEAMMATES
	pass by Monica with their arms raised, mimicking her pose.
	Monica shakes her head.

	Sidra glances at Monica from her spot on the bench.

				SIDRA
		That's what you get for trying to show
		out, freshman.

				MONICA
		I was just playing ball.

				SIDRA
		You were trying to make me look bad.

				MONICA
		Didn't have to try very hard.

	Ears prick up around the locker room.  Sidra stands.

				SIDRA
		Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy
		seconds?

	Monica rises.

				MONICA
		What?

	Toni tries to step in.

				TONI
		Sidra, let it go.

				SIDRA
		Only reason you're here is cause Tonya
		Randall got pregnant and decided not to
		come.  They were done recruiting.

	KELLI, senior forward, shakes her head.

				KELLI
		That's cold, Sid.

				SIDRA
		Just thought the girl should know.

	Monica is stunned.  Sidra saunters to the showers.  Shayla
	nudges her with her shoulder.

				SHAYLA
		Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause
		she's bow-legged.

	  INT. USC SUITES - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT



	Monica and Quincy lay feet to face on Quincy's twin bed.

	Monica's hand holds an ice bag on Quincy's hip.  Quincy's arm
	rests across an ice bag on Monica's ankle.

				QUINCY
		Forget Tonya Randall.

				MONICA
		I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was
		here instead of me.

				QUINCY
		Then prove her wrong.

				MONICA
		I don't have it easy like you, alright.
		There's no red carpet laid out for me.

				QUINCY
		So you're gonna act salty all night?

	Quincy's roommate/teammate REGGIE, 18, suddenly pops his head
	into the room.

				REGGIE
		Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings.

				QUINCY
		Nah, thanks.

	Reggie shrugs, closes the door.  Quincy looks at Monica,
	still brooding.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Fine.  Don't worry about proving
		everybody wrong, okay?  You can't handle
		the pressure, I'll understand.

				MONICA
		That was so weak.

				QUINCY
		Who cares if you're never known as the
		first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more
		play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.

	Monica shoves Quincy's ice bag down his sweat pants.  He
	leaps up.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Aaaah!  Damn, girl!

				MONICA
		That's what you get.

	He smiles as he pulls the ice.  Then looks her up and down.

				QUINCY
		So how about a little one-on-one?

				MONICA
		What are we playing for?

				QUINCY
		Clothes.

				MONICA
		What?

	Quincy locks the door, sets up his indoor hoop.

				QUINCY
		I score, you strip.  You score, I drop
		something.

	Monica looks at him, then cracks up.

				MONICA
		Give me the ball.

				QUINCY
		My court, I go first.

	Quincy grips the ball.  Monica crouches low on defense.
	Quincy drives past her and slams down a vicious dunk.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Strip.

	Monica makes a face, then pulls off her sweatshirt.  Quincy
	skips back.  Monica drops low again.  Quincy fakes her out
	and slams down another vicious dunk.  He laughs.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Where's the "D"?

				MONICA
		Kiss my booty.

				QUINCY
		Plan to.

	Monica glares through her smile, then pulls off her T-shirt,
	leaving her in a bra and shorts.

	Quincy goes for another dunk, but this time, Monica reaches
	out, GRABS HIS DICK.  Quincy drops the ball.  Monica picks it
	up and lays it in.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hold up...

				MONICA
		All's fair in love and basketball.
		Strip.

	Quincy pulls off his shirt.  Monica moves back into position.
	Quincy drops down low.  Monica fakes, gets him to leave his
	feet.  She slips under him and scores.  She laughs.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Too bad you got your mama's height, huh.

	Quincy pulls off his sweats, leaving him in just drawers.
	Monica takes in the view as she moves back into position.

	She holds the ball out, taunting.  Quincy pretends to reach
	for it, but grabs her breast instead.

				QUINCY
		Oh, my bad.

	She drives.  Quincy just steps out of the way and lets her
	score.  Monica snatches the ball off the floor.

				MONICA
		Yo, where's the "D"?

				QUINCY
		Right here.

	Monica turns, finds Quincy butt-naked.  He moves her against
	the wall and kisses her.  Monica drops the ball, wraps her
	arms around him.  She smiles.

				MONICA
		I won.

				QUINCY
		I wanted you to.

	Game over.  They hit it.

	Sportscaster DICK VITALE talks animatedly about the upcoming
	season.

				DICK VITALE
		It's the start of the new college season
		and I'm like a kid in a candy store.  Too
		many great teams to choose from.  You
		have your Dukes', Kentuckys', Arkansas',
		but my surprise treat this season...

	INT. BASKETBALL COURT

	Sportscaster ROBIN ROBERTS reports on the upcoming women's
	season.

				ROBIN ROBERTS
		...USC.  The women of Troy made it to the
		Sweet Sixteen last year and are returning
		four starters from that squad.  And many
		consider their recruiting class one of
		the best in the nation.  The highlight of
		that class,...

	INT. ESPN STUDIOS

				DICK VITALE
		...is Quincy McCall, one of my diaper
		dandies.  He's a real P.T.P., a prime-
		time player.  Every college in the
		country wanted him but he chose to follow
		in his father's footsteps and become a
		Trojan.  He's gonna have a lot on his
		shoulders this season...

	INT. BASKETBALL COURT

				ROBIN ROBERTS
		...but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if
		just one of her freshmen has a breakout
		year, they can go all the way.  It's a
		long season, anything can happen, but one
		thing is for sure...

	INT. ESPN STUDIOS

				DICK VITALE
		It's gonna be awesome, baby!

	MONTAGE:

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

	A hundred flashbulbs pop as Quincy jogs out to center court.
	The crowd goes crazy as...

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - NIGHT

	Monica sits on the bench, watching Sidra run the floor
	against UNLV, as...

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

	Quincy drives to the three-point line against Cal and puts it
	up.  It drops through the net.  He pounds his fist against
	the number twenty-two on his chest, nods to Zeke standing
	behind the bench, as...

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - NIGHT

	Coach Miller motions to Monica.  She jumps up, pulls off her
	sweats.  She jogs past Arizona bench and onto the floor,
	as...

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

	Quincy goes up for a dunk against North Carolina.  He jams it
	down, grips the rim, and pulls his legs up high, as...

	INT. KAISER ARENA - NIGHT

	Monica catches a long outlet pass.  She drops a no-look
	bounce pass between two Berkeley defenders, to a teammate who
	scores.  She jogs back, as...

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

	Zeke grips Quincy's head proudly, affectionately, as they
	walk off the floor after a game against Washington, as...

	INT. UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT - GAMPEL PAVILION - NIGHT

	Sidra crashes to the floor, immediately grabs at her ankle.
	Monica rises off the bench...

								 CUT TO:
								 
								 
	  INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

	Televisions hang from every corner, broadcasting various
	games.

	Zeke and Quincy sit at a bar.  Quincy is still hyped from his
	game.

				QUINCY
		...up and under between two defenders,
		with the left hand.  That's gotta make
		SportsCenter.

	Zeke just nods as the Bartender/Owner crosses over.  He is an
	ex-ballplayer named TERRY.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		They can't stop me, Pop...

				TERRY
		What are you having, Zeke?

				ZEKE
		Genuine Draft.  And an orange juice for
		my kid.

				TERRY
		Cross-over's looking good, Quincy.  I
		know your old man didn't teach you that.

				ZEKE
		Didn't need a cross-over to post you up.

	Terry laughs as he moves off to fix the drinks.  Something is
	on Zeke's mind, but before he can speak on it...

				QUINCY
		You know, the numbers I'm putting up are
		better than any freshman.  Some people
		are saying I'm a definite lottery pick.

	Zeke suddenly focuses.

				ZEKE
		What people?

				QUINCY
		You know, people.

				ZEKE
		Well, tell them to mind their damn
		business.  You're smart enough to get a
		degree.

				QUINCY
		I'm also good enough to go pro.

				ZEKE
		You know how much higher the play level
		is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to
		develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The
		NBA ain't going nowhere.

				QUINCY
		You came out early.

				ZEKE
		Your mom got pregnant and I had to make
		choices.  You don't have a choice.

				QUINCY
		Okay...

	Silence, then.

				ZEKE
		Besides, the sooner you go pro, the
		sooner you'll have to deal with the mess
		I'm dealing with.

				QUINCY
		What mess?

				ZEKE
		there's this thing out there.  This
		paternity suit.

				QUINCY
		What?

				ZEKE
		Some girl that's been hanging on at every
		party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's
		Daddy.
			(then)
		Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be
		the one who told you.

				QUINCY
		Tell me what?

				ZEKE
		I just told you.

				QUINCY
		I mean, it's not true, is it?

	Zeke stares at his son.

				ZEKE
		You got the balls to ask me that?

	Quincy can't hold his father's look.  Zeke shakes his head,
	hurt.

				QUINCY
		Sorry.

				ZEKE
		No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say
		it.  It's not true.

	Quincy looks in his father's eyes, knows he's telling the
	truth.

				QUINCY
		So what are you gonna do?

				ZEKE
		I want this thing to go to court, but my
		lawyer's telling me to settle.

				QUINCY
		Why?

				ZEKE
		A case like this could hang around for
		months and I'm up for this player
		relations job with the "Clips."  This
		gets out, false or not, no one'll touch
		me.

				QUINCY
		What's Mom think?

				ZEKE
		We haven't exactly been living the fairy-
		tale life the past few years.  Something
		like this happens, it either brings a
		family closer or pushes them further
		apart.  We'll just have to see how it
		plays out.
			(then)
		I'm giving her some space, couple
		days...

	Just then, a COLLEGE STUDENT approaches.

				COLLEGE STUDENT
		Yo, Q-man, great game.

				QUINCY
		Thanks.

	The student holds out a piece of paper, without even a glance
	to Zeke.

				COLLEGE STUDENT
		Can I get an autograph?

	Quincy nods, signs the guy's paper.  Zeke watches his son,
	the rising star.

	EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - NIGHT

	Through the windows, we see Quincy enter the house.  He
	glances around, then walks to the living room.  He sees his
	mom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn
	up.  He pulls open the sliding glass door.  Nona jumps, then
	sees Quincy.  She quickly puts her drink down.

				NONA
		You scared me.

				QUINCY
		Sorry.  You okay?

				NONA
		I'm fine.

	Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass.

				QUINCY
		Last time I remember you drinking was
		when Marvin Gaye died.

	No response from Nona.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		This about Dad?

				NONA
		Guess he talked to you.

				QUINCY
		Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later
		the truth'll come out.

				NONA
			(beat)
		Whose truth are you talking about?

				QUINCY
		Mom, we can't let something like this
		mess up the family.

	She doesn't respond.  Quincy studies her.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I mean, you believe him, right?

	Nona sits silent, humiliated.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Mom?

				NONA
		Just...leave it alone.

				QUINCY
		This is just about money, you know that.

				NONA
		Quincy, please...

				QUINCY
		I mean, how many times have you told me
		yourself to watch out for these ho's?

				NONA
		Guess I should have been telling your
		father.

				QUINCY
		So you're gonna take the word of some
		trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.

	Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him.

	Confused, Quincy opens it.  HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS:

	Zeke outside a party.  IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a
	young woman.  IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS.  AND YET ANOTHER,
	they climb into his car.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		What...what's this?

				NONA
		I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that?
		After all his late nights and "meetings"
		and I still needed proof.

	Quincy just stares at the photos.

				NONA (cont'd)
		I used to think I was lucky just to be
		married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too
		tired.

	Quincy looks stricken, but he moves to Nona, comforts her as
	she cries...
	
	
	  EXT. TRACK - NIGHT



	Monica sits with a devastated Quincy, high up in the
	bleachers.  In the distance, the clock-tower glows 10:50.

				QUINCY
		Don't put your hands in your pockets,
		hold your head up, always look a man in
		the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on
		his every word like he's God or
		something...

				MONICA
		I know he messed up, but that doesn't
		change what he's been to you.

				QUINCY
		What has he been to me?  I mean, he
		looked me in my face and lied like it was
		nothing.  Like it was easy.
			(then)
		And I'm standing there getting loud on my
		mom like she's the one with no sense...

				MONICA
		She understands.

				QUINCY
		He even had me wanting to play for the
		"Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.

				MONICA
		You're not stupid.

				QUINCY
		I know a lot of brothers dog their wives,
		I just never thought my pops would do
		some shit like this...

	Monica puts her arms around him.  They sit there, quiet.
	Monica glances up at the clock tower.  She reacts.  Quincy
	notices.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		What?

				MONICA
		Nothing.
			(beat)
		Why don't we walk to my dorm?

				QUINCY
		I'm not up for running into anybody.
		Let's just kick it here, alright?

				MONICA
		I...can't.

				QUINCY
		Why not?

				MONICA
		Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew.
		If I'm late, I don't suit up.

	Quincy looks at her, almost in shock.

				QUINCY
		Didn't realize you were watching the
		clock.

				MONICA
		I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.

				QUINCY
		Nah.  Don't sweat it.

				MONICA
		Quincy...

				QUINCY
		For real.  I should be alone, anyway.

	Monica reluctantly stands.

				MONICA
		Will you call me when you get in?

	Quincy nods.  Monica gives him a kiss.  Then she turns and
	crosses away.

	INT. MONICA/SHAYLA'S DORM - NIGHT

	The lights are off but Monica sits up in bed.  SHE WEARS
	BOXERS AND ONE OF QUINCY'S PRACTICE SHIRTS.

	Shayla lies under her covers across the room.

				MONICA
		I shouldn't have left.

				SHAYLA
		Go to sleep.

				MONICA
		You should have seen him, Shay...

				SHAYLA
		Mon, Sidra's out for one game, and you
		got the start.  But you get caught
		breaking curfew and Coach is gonna send
		your ass back to the bench.  You'll see
		your man tomorrow.

	Shayla's warning slowly sinks in.  Finally, Monica lays down.

								   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. TRACK - NIGHT

	The clock tower glows 12:30.  Quincy still sits in the
	bleachers.  Alone.  Tears fill his eyes as his world comes
	crashing down...

								   DISSOLVE TO:
								
								
	  INT. CAMPUS GYM - LATE DAY



	USC vs. Louisiana Tech.  The packed crowd is hyped.  Nathan

	sits by himself in the stands, excited.



	Monica sits on the bench with four of her teammates.  The
	rest of the team is lined up in front of them, including
	Sidra in street clothes.

				ANNOUNCER
		And now the starting line-up for your
		Women of Troy!  At center, a senior, Toni
		Noise!

	Toni rises, jogs through the line of teammates to the court.

				ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
		At forward, a senior, Lisa Mason!

	Lisa stands, skips through the line.

				ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
		At forward, a junior, Zvette Mitchell!

	Zvette jumps up, bumps into each teammate as she moves down
	the line.

				ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
		At guard, a freshman, Monica Wright!

	Monica takes a deep breath, then jogs through the line.  She
	gets to the middle of the floor and looks around with her
	game face on.

				ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
		And at guard, a sophomore, Sandra Perez!

	Sandra jogs out and the rest of the team follows.  Everyone
	gathers in a tight circle with their arms around each other.

				TONI
		Look y'all, we got all these people here
		to see big-bad, La Tech.  We need to let
		them know that this is our house.  So
		everybody better leave everything out on
		that floor, you got that?  Ready?  One,
		two, three....

				TEAM
		Team!

								  SMASH CUT TO:

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - LATE DAY

	A sellout crowd for the men's SC/Temple game.  And Quincy is
	having the worst game of his life.

	He drives down court on a fast break.  He ignores his two
	open teammates and puts up a three-pointer.  It hits nothing
	but air.  The crowd boos.

	Humiliated, Quincy tries to steal the ball back and commits a
	stupid foul.  His teammates glare at him as they line up for
	free throws.

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - CONTINUOUS

	Monica's game.  Late second half.  SC down two.

	Monica drives the lane, drawing two defenders.  She looks
	like she's about to force up a shot, then suddenly whips up a
	pass to a wide-open Sandra at the three-point line.  Nothing
	but net.  SC up one.

	Coach Miller claps intensely on the sideline.

				COACH MILLER
		That's it, that's it!

	Ten seconds left.  Game on the line.  Monica tries to lob a
	pass inside to Toni.  The pass is knocked away and grabbed up
	by the opposing point guard.

	It is a one-on-one between Monica and the guard.  The girl
	drives hard for the winning hoop.  Monica races to the key
	and slides in front of her.  The guard goes up and slams into
	Monica.  Both crash to the floor as the ball drops through
	the net and the buzzer goes off.

	A WHISTLE.  The two women stare up at the REFEREE from the
	floor.  And then --

				REFEREE
		Offensive foul!  Charging!  No basket!

	Monica leaps up as the crowd goes crazy.  Toni grabs up
	Monica in a hug as their teammates celebrate around them.

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy drags himself to his bench, slumps down dejectedly, as
	the Temple Owls celebrate their win around him.

	INT. LOCKER ROOM - DUSK

	The female players continue to celebrate as they undress.

				MAEYEN
		Shoot, you see that crowd?  We need to be
		playing in the Sports Arena.

				KELLI
		Hell yeah.

	They give each other a pound.

	Lisa looks at Monica, standing in her shorts and sports bra.

				LISA
		Oh damn, Mon.

				MONICA
		What?

				LISA
		I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis
		with that charge.

	The women break into laughter.  Monica smiles.

				MONICA
		Kiss my ass.

				SANDRA
		Nah, I think she took that too.

				MONICA
		Sandra, please, last time you chest-
		bumped me, it took you three tries.

	More laughter.  Monica looks over at Toni, sitting quietly at
	the bench.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Yo, T, why you so quiet?

				TONI
			(beat)
		I don't want to go play overseas.

				DORA
		I thought you were hyped about going to
		Portugal next year.

				TONI
		It's never gonna be like this.  Playing
		in front of my family, hanging out with
		my girls.  Probably not even a
		McDonald's.

				SANDRA
		Nah, there's always a McDonald's.

				SIDRA
		Least you got an offer.  My agent's
		still looking.

				CREE
			(to Lisa)
		What about you?

				LISA
			(beat)
		Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day
		I could come back here and play.  But for
		right now, it's law school.

				COACH MILLER (O.S.)
		Monica.

	Monica turns, sees Coach Miller standing in her office
	doorway.  She motions for her.  Monica heads over.  Sidra
	watches.

	INT. COACH MILLER'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

	Trophies, plaques and photos fill every empty space.

	Coach Miller sits behind her desk.  Monica stands before her.

				COACH MILLER
		You could've given up after you threw
		that ball away.  But you kept your head
		and you showed real heart.

				MONICA
		Thanks.

				COACH MILLER
		We've got our final games against Oregon
		and Oregon State and I want to shake
		things up a bit, so I'm starting you at
		point again.

				MONICA
			(confused)
		I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next
		game.

				COACH MILLER
		You want the job or not?

	Realization finally hits.

				MONICA
		Yeah.  Yes.

	Monica looks at Coach Miller completely thrown.

				COACH MILLER
		What?

				MONICA
		It's just...it seems like you're always
		yelling at me.

				COACH MILLER
		You think I'd go hoarse for a player with
		no potential?   When I ignore you, that's
		when you worry.
			(then)
		Go get dressed.

	Monica nods, crosses out.

	INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	As Monica walks back to her teammates, Coach Miller steps
	into the doorway.

				COACH MILLER
		Sidra.

	Sidra looks at Monica as she rises, crosses over.  Monica
	avoids her eyes as they pass.  Sidra enters the office and
	the door closes.

				SHAYLA
		Yo sis, what's going on?

	Beat, then Monica smiles.

								  SMASH CUT TO:
								
								
	  INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT



	Black folks pack the cramped houseparty, bumping to a phat

	hip hop joint.



	Monica bounces through the throng.  A GIRL grabs her arm.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Yo, great game.

				MONICA
		Thanks.

	Another PARTY-GOER grabs her arm.

				PARTY-GOER
		Girl, you can play.

	Monica smiles wider.  She spots Reggie dancing in the crowd,
	moves to him.

				MONICA
		Reg.  You seen Quincy?

				REGGIE
		What's up, girl.

				MONICA
			(louder)
		Derek said Q was here.

				REGGIE
		We'll roll through.

	Monica is suddenly pulled into a dance routine by Sandra and
	Lisa.

	She laughs, tires to move away, but they won't let her go.
	Monica gives in, grooves with them.

	ANGLE ON:

	Quincy walks through the door with a half-empty forty in his
	hand.  Girls immediately try to grab his attention from the
	dance floor, or stare him down from the sidelines.

	Quincy sees Monica on the dance floor.  He stands, watching
	her.  Takes a drink.  Monica finally looks over, sees him.
	She smiles, crosses to him.

				MONICA
		Hey.

				QUINCY
		What's up?

				MONICA
		I've been trying to find you all day.

				QUINCY
		Here I am.

	She glances at the forty in his hand.

				MONICA
		Sorry about your game.

				QUINCY
		It happens, right...

	Shayla suddenly grabs Monica from behind.

				SHAYLA
			(to Monica)
		What's up, superstar.
			(then, to Quincy)
		Your girl was on tonight.  She tell you?

				QUINCY
			(beat)
		I heard.

				SHAYLA
		She also tell you she ganked the starting
		spot from Sidra?

	Monica looks at him for a reaction.

				QUINCY
		Nah.

	He downs the last of his forty.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Where's the keg at?

				SHAYLA
		Balcony.

	He heads for the glass doors.  Monica and Shayla follow.

	EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

	Reggie approaches the group.  Gives Quincy a nod.

				REGGIE
		What's up, dog?
			(to Shayla)
		Hey, flyness.

				SHAYLA
		Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a
		ho.

	He laughs, then turns back to Quincy.

				REGGIE
		Coach is gonna kill us in practice
		tomorrow.  Might even pull his lips off
		your dick, limp as your game was tonight.

	Quincy just looks at him.

				QUINCY
		That's funny.

	Monica leans against Quincy, affectionately.

				MONICA
		he's just playing, Q...

				QUINCY
		You think for once we could talk about
		something besides basketball?

				SHAYLA
		Sure.

				REGGIE
		Whatever's clever.

	Silence.  Reggie and Shayla crack up.  Quincy shakes his
	head, moves to the keg line.

				MONICA
		Y'all need to quit.

	She starts for Quincy

				SIDRA (O.S.)
		Monica.

	Monica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway.  There
	is no escaping this confrontation.  She glances at Quincy,
	then crosses over.  Quincy turns, sees her disappear back
	inside.

	INT. HOUSEPARTY - CONTINUOUS

				MONICA
		What's up?

				SIDRA
		Just wanted to say good game.

				MONICA
		But?

				SIDRA
		No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take
		that charge.

				MONICA
		Thanks.

				SIDRA
		But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni.
		Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.

	Monica shakes her head.  An awkward silence.

				SIDRA (cont'd)
		I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed.

				MONICA
		I know.

				SIDRA
		Just one word of advice for next season.

				MONICA
		What's that?

				SIDRA
		Never let a freshman take your spot.

	Sidra turns and walks away.

	EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy takes one long drink from his cup.  KERRY, 20, and
	spandexed, stands directly in front of him, flirtatiously.

				KERRY
		Excuse me.

				QUINCY
		Excuse me.

	He steps aside as she tries to work the keg.  Nothing comes
	out.  She nods at his cup, smiles.

				KERRY
		If that's the last beer, you and I are
		sharing.

	Shayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of
	times.  Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up.

				KERRY (cont'd)
		I like watching you play.  Number twenty-
		two.

				QUINCY
		Guess you didn't see the game.

	Quincy knows he should blow her off, but he's digging the
	attention.  He hands her back her cup.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		What's your name?

				KERRY
		Kerry.

				QUINCY
		Q.

				KERRY
		I know.

	ANGLE ON

	Monica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the
	hoochie.  The girl looks too damn comfortable.  Monica moves
	back outside.

				KERRY (cont'd)
		I'll see you.  Q-man.

	She swishes past Monica.  Shayla "accidentally" bumps her.
	Kerry glares.

				MONICA
		Who was that?

				QUINCY
		Nobody.

				MONICA
		Who's nobody?

				QUINCY
		Look, this party's whack.  You ready to
		go?

				MONICA
		You want to go talk?

				QUINCY
		Not really.

	He leans in, kisses her drunkenly.  She pulls away.

				MONICA
		We could finish what we were talking
		about last night.

	Quincy kisses her again.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Q...
			(pushing him off)
		Quincy, quit.  You're drunk.

	They fall silent.

				QUINCY
		You know what, I'm just gonna crash.

				MONICA
			(agitated)
		Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.

				QUINCY
		Nah.  I have curfew.

	He starts to walk away, then stops.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Oh, by the way.  Congratulations.

	He goes.  Monica stares after him.
	
	
	  INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Quincy pushes through his front door, then stops short in his
	doorway.  Zeke sits on the couch.

				QUINCY
		What are you doing here?

				ZEKE
		Your door was unlocked.

				QUINCY
		Still is, so let yourself out.

				ZEKE
		We need to talk.

				QUINCY
		We ain't got nothing to talk about.

				ZEKE
		I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I
		ain't that kid's father.

				QUINCY
		Lucky kid.

				ZEKE
		Look, I ain't saying it was right, but
		sometimes things happen.

				QUINCY
		And some things should never fucking
		happen!

				ZEKE
		Boy, you're so perfect you can look down
		on me?

				QUINCY
		I ain't a damn liar.

				ZEKE
		Your mom was real quick to show you those
		pictures, wasn't she?
		Well, she was nineteen when she got
		pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're
		the best thing in my life, but she knew I
		wasn't ready for no marriage.

				QUINCY
		So now you're saying my mother trapped
		you?

				ZEKE
		I'm saying I handled my responsibilities
		like a man.  But when you're in the NBA,
		you pull into a city and there's a
		hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And
		another twenty that made it past security
		on your floor.  And the boldest one is
		standing right at your door.  And after
		awhile, it just becomes part of the game.
			(then)
		I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't
		have.  But I did it cause I love you.

	Zeke looks at his son, meaning every word.  Quincy stares
	back, long and hard.

				QUINCY
		Since we're being honest, guess I should
		tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and
		going pro.

				ZEKE
		What?

	Quincy just stares back.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Quincy, you'd be making the biggest
		mistake of your life.

				QUINCY
			(sarcastic)
		From your mouth.

				ZEKE
			(desperate)
		I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't
		let you do this.

				QUINCY
		Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's
		vocabulary.

	Zeke is taken aback by the hatred in his son's eyes.  He
	turns and without another word, exits.

	EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

	Quincy stands across the street from the houseparty, staring
	up at the balcony.  Monica leans against the railing,
	laughing with a couple of teammates.  Quincy watches her,
	then turns and walks away...

	  EXT. CAMPUS GYM - LATE DAY



	SLOW MOTION.  Monica's eyes are on fire as she races an

	Oregon player for a loose ball.  Both dive for it, slide

	across the floor.  Monica grabs it up, screams for a time-out
	as her opponent tries to wrestle away the ball...

	EXT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - DUSK

	Monica walks down the hall to Quincy's suite.  The window is
	open.  The sounds of Nintendo are heard.  She walks in
	without knocking.

	INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Reggie sits on the couch with a TEAMMATE, playing Nintendo's
	"Duck Hunt".

				MONICA
		Hey, y'all.

	They barely give her a nod.  Monica crosses into

	INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy stands at an ironing board, ironing a T-shirt.

				MONICA
		Hey.

				QUINCY
		Hey, what's up.

				MONICA
		You weren't at my game.

				QUINCY
		Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this
		meeting with this guy.

	Quincy pulls on the T-shirt.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		You win?

				MONICA
		Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.

				QUINCY
		The "man" again.

				MONICA
			(smiles)
		Woman...

	A knock at the front door.  Quincy exits.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Monica follows, then stops short.  Kerry, the spandexed girl
	from the party, stands in the doorway.

				QUINCY
		Hey, you.

				KERRY
		Hi.

	Quincy gives her a hug.  Monica stares at him in disbelief.
	Reggie and his teammate smack each other, "Oh shit!"

				QUINCY
		Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica,
		Kerry.

				MONICA
		What the hell's going on?

				QUINCY
		We're going to get some food.

				MONICA
		Are you out of your mind?

				KERRY
		Maybe I should come back?

				MONICA
		No.  You stay, I'll leave.

	She storms out.

	EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DUSK

	BAM!  Monica slams her car door.  Her face is a mask of anger
	and confusion.

	Camille exits the house, car keys in hand.  She sees her.

				CAMILLE
		Monica.  What are you doing here?

				MONICA
		Didn't know I needed a reason to come
		home.

				CAMILLE
		Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised
		to see you.

				MONICA
		Dad around?

				CAMILLE
		He's still at the bank.

	Monica glowers.  Camille looks at her.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Everything okay?

				MONICA
			(clearly not)
		Yeah.

	Camille just nods, doesn't bother asking again.

				CAMILLE
		Well, I'm going to get dinner.

	She pulls open her car door.  Beat, then...

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		It's just a game.

				MONICA
		What?

				CAMILLE
		Whenever you lose, you get this attitude.
		But it's just a game.

	Monica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves.

	EXT. DORMS - NIGHT

	Quincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica
	slowly makes her way up the walk.  She sees him, stops.

				QUINCY
		Can we talk?

				MONICA
		Talk to your new girlfriend.

				QUINCY
		I just took the ho to Burger King,
		alright.

				MONICA
		Cheap date.

				QUINCY
		Least she had time for me.

				MONICA
		So you fucked around to prove a point!

				QUINCY
		I just said I didn't fuck around.  But
		you got your head so far up your ass it
		took a cheap date for you to notice me.

				MONICA
		What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your
		ass like everybody else?

				QUINCY
		You forgot to be there.

				MONICA
		That night you wanted to talk about your
		Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed
		to do?

				QUINCY
		Stay!

				MONICA
		If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!

				QUINCY
		Least you got your priorities straight.

				MONICA
		I never asked you to choose.

				QUINCY
		Never had to.

				MONICA
		I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what
		that means it should be you.

				QUINCY
		Well, if all you care about is
		basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck
		Dick Vitale.

	Monica punches the shit out of Quincy, then pushes past him.
	Quincy grabs her arm, stopping her.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hold up.  I'm sorry, alright.

	They stand, silent.  Trying to come down from their anger.

				MONICA
		How do I know next time you're feeling
		neglected or whatever, you're not going
		to run around on me?  If we're going to
		be together I have to be able to trust
		you.

				QUINCY
		I'm not asking for us to be together.

	Monica flinches in shock.

				MONICA
		What?

				QUINCY
		I'm going through a lot of shit right
		now, more than you have time for.

				MONICA
		How are you going to tell me what I have
		time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we
		can fix this.

				QUINCY
		I don't think so.

				MONICA
		You don't think so?

				QUINCY
		Look, I'm entering the draft.

				MONICA
		You're what?

				QUINCY
		I decided to go pro.  And who knows where
		I'll end up, you know?

	Monica's heart is sinking fast.

				MONICA
		When did you decide all this?

				QUINCY
		Few days ago.

				MONICA
		So that's it, just forget about us?

				QUINCY
		Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us
		anymore, it's about me.

	Monica is crushed.  Beat as, Quincy struggles to stay cold.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		But, you know, I'd still like us to be
		friends.

				MONICA
		Friends.

	She fights back tears.  Quincy has to look away.  Monica
	can't respond.

				QUINCY
		So...I guess I'll see you around.

				MONICA
		Uh huh.

	Beat, then Quincy turns and walks away.  Monica tries to
	fight her tears but her pain, hurt and confusion are too
	much.  Finally, she gives in, and the tears fall.

	TITLE CARD: "FOURTH QUARTER" then "1993"



	ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF SPAIN



	Madrid, Pampolona, the running of the bulls, old-world
	architecture.

	Finally, we rest on a large billboard, a photo of Monica in a
	basketball uniform, drinking a Spanish soft-drink.

	EXT. STREETS OF SPAIN - LATE DAY

	Monica jogs down the congested cobble-stone street, a sports
	bag over her shoulder.  She is TWENTY-THREE.  Half-assed
	braids frame her matured features.

	She passes store fronts, street vendors, and dodges
	pedestrians, as she makes her way toward a large, older
	arena.

	EXT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

	An excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors.
	Above them, a huge banner reads "Campeonato de Europeo".
	(European Championships".)

	As Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a
	large contingent in the crowd.  Monica smiles, waves back.
	TWO LITTLE GIRLS break from line, run to her.

				LITTLE GIRLS
		Baloncesto!  Balencesto!  (Basketball!
		Basketball!)

				MONICA
		Oye.

	They giggle, hold out a piece of paper and a pencil.

				LITTLE GIRLS
		Autografo.

	As Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a
	matching sports bag approaches.  She is LUISA, Spanish, 33.

				LUISA
			(thick Spanish accent)
		Monica.  What is up?

				MONICA
		Oye, Luisa.

	Monica hands the girls her autograph and they run off.

				LUISA
		Large game, no?

				MONICA
		Si.  Large game.

	They duck into the arena.

	INT. ARENA - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY

	Paint peels off the walls.  Windows are broken overhead.

	Monica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles.  Her
	TEN TEAMMATES, all from Spain, sit on the surrounding
	benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish.
	Monica is clearly an outsider.

	COACH PARRA, Spanish, late 40's, enters.

				COACH PARRA
		Silenco!

	The women immediately stop talking.  COACH PARRA gives an
	animated, impassioned speech in Spanish.  Monica doesn't
	understand a word, just continues taping her ankles.

	Coach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up. Monica
	turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench.

				MONICA
		What did he say?

				LUISA
		He say to give the ball to you.

	INT. ARENA - NIGHT

	The arena is PACKED with a raucous European crowd, chanting
	and waving signs - the love their women's basketball.

	Monica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her
	shorts.  The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight.
	Her club's name is stitched on the front, "GODELLA".

	As she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her
	game face.  Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing
	Italian club is Sidra, HER RIVAL FROM USC.

				SIDRA
		Well, what do you know.

				MONICA
		What's up, Sidra.

				SIDRA
		I'm gonna love winning this championship
		in your house.

				MONICA
		How do you say "you're dreaming" in
		Italian?

	They move into position.  The ball is tossed up.  Italy winds
	the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra.

	Monica hounds her as she brings up the ball.  Sidra shoves
	her off and to the floor, and scores.  No whistle.  Women's
	pro ball is at a whole other level.  Bigger, better, tougher.

	The ball is passed in to Monica.  She drives down court, goes
	up for a lay up.  An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air,
	taking out her legs.  Monica crashes on the hardwood.

	A whistle.  Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes
	herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word.
	Without emotion.

	INT. SPAIN - NIGHTCLUB - LATE NIGHT

	A huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music.  In
	the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of
	the party.

	In a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching
	the festivities.  A large trophy sits on the table.

				SIDRA
		Can you take that damn thing off the
		table.

				MONICA
		You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.

	Monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm
	around it.  Sidra shakes her head.

				SIDRA
		Still a cocky bitch.

	Monica laughs.  She downs her drink, motions to the waiter.

				MONICA
		Uno mas, por favor.

	The waiter nods.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden.

				SIDRA
		Yeah, four years ago.  They had me
		staying in this tiny-ass town with like
		fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was
		about a thousand goats running around,
		and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then
		the whack club I'm on loses three games
		in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire
		me.

				MONICA
		Just like that?

				SIDRA
		Yup.  So I've been playing with this
		Italian club the last three years.

				MONICA
		How's that been?

				SIDRA
		It's better.  Even though the whole first
		season my teammates didn't pass to me
		cause they were mad "The American" was
		making more money.
			(smiles)
		I led the team in rebounds cause it was
		the only way I could touch the damn ball.

	Monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink.  She tries to
	pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away.

				SIDRA (cont'd)
		Most of us don't win championships our
		first year overseas.

				MONICA
		Please, I went through the same drama as
		everybody else.  I mean, the first four
		months, only person I could talk to was
		this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words
		of English from watching old "Dif'rent
		Strokes" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to
		tell her if she said, "What you talking
		bout, Willis?" one more time, I was
		gonna kick her ass.

	Sidra laughs.  They watch the madness out on the dance floor.

				SIDRA
		So what are these Spanish guys like?

				MONICA
		I wouldn't know.

				SIDRA
		What?  You've been over here seven months
		and you ain't tapped anything?

				MONICA
		Just not my type, I guess.

				SIDRA
		Shoot, Italian boys love them some black
		women.  They can't get enough of me.

	Monica smiles.

				MONICA
		You ever think about going back?

				SIDRA
		Sometimes.  But what's the alternative,
		not playing?  You remember big Toni?
			(off Monica's nod)
		She quit last year, now she's working at
		some bookstore.  I mean, look at us.
		They treat us like we're Hollywood stars
		over here.  We just played in the
		championship game.  It doesn't get much
		sweeter than this.

	Monica takes this in.  Her eyes do not reflect someone on top
	of the world.  She takes a long drink.

	INT. SPAIN - MONICA'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

	A small, sparse, one-bedroom.  Sam, Diane and the rest of the
	gang from "Cheers" fill the small TV screen that flickers in
	the darkness.  Their dialogue is dubbed in Spanish.

	Monica sits on the floor, braiding her hair.

	SHE WEARS BOXERS AND QUINCY'S OLD PRACTICE SHIRT.  AFTER FIVE
	YEARS, IT IS WELL-WORN.

	Feelings of loneliness threaten to swallow her whole.  She
	looks out her window and sees her billboard, looming in the
	distance.  She just stares.
	
	
	  INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT



	The crowd erupts as a Laker player dunks the ball on a fast

	break.



	ANGLE ON



	Laker announcers CHICK HEARN and STU LANTZ.



				CHICK HEARN

		Stu, this game is in the refrigerator.
		The door is closed, the lights are out,
		the butter's hard and the Jell-Oooooo's
		jigglin'.

				STU LANTZ
		And here come the subs.

	ANGLE ON

	Quincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the
	rest of the subs.  He is twenty-three, a man.  His goatee and
	tired eyes make him look older.  HE NOW WEARS NUMBER TWENTY-
	ONE.

				STU LANTZ (cont'd) (V.O.)
		It's good to see these guys get a little
		playing time.  And the fans love it.

	Quincy immediately gets a pass in the corner.  He puts up a
	quick three and it banks hard off the rim.

	ANGLE ON

	Chick and Stu.

				CHICK HEARN
		Three-pointer is off for the kid from
		SC.  Came out after his freshman year,
		now in his fifth year with the league.

				STU LANTZ
		The son of Zeke McCall, played twelve
		years with the Clippers.

				CHICK HEARN
			(nods)
		Pretty good player.  The kid's moved
		around quite a bit, but he's hoping to
		finally have a home with the Lakers.

	ANGLE ON

	Quincy steals the ball, has nothing but open court ahead of
	him.

				CHICK HEARN (cont'd) (V.O.)
		Watch out, folks, it's showtime.

	Quincy takes off from the hash-mark and throws down a monster
	jam.  He swings high off the rim.  Too high.  His hand slips
	and he crashes to the floor.  His knee twists at a sickening
	angle.

	The dwindling crowd gasps as Quincy clutches his left knee,
	writhing in pain.

	INT. DANIEL FREEMAN HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

	Zeke walks down the corridor, checking room numbers.  He is
	forty-five now.  His slight paunch as become a roll.

	He sees Nona exiting a room, with an empty water pitcher in
	hand.  Her hair is in locks.

				ZEKE
		Nona.

	Nona looks over.  Her eyes narrow.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		How's he doing?

				NONA
		Not great.

				ZEKE
		What's that, not great?

				NONA
		The doctor'll be back in a minute.

				ZEKE
		Nona, please.

				NONA
		He tore his ACL.

	Zeke's shoulders slump.  Then he looks back at her.

				ZEKE
		Almost didn't recognize you with your
		hair like that.  How you been?

				NONA
		Happy.  And he won't want to see you.

	Nona walks over to a MAN standing nearby.  He puts an arm
	around her and they move down the hall.  Zeke watches for a
	beat, then pulls open Quincy's door, steps inside.

	INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy lays in the bed.  His knee is bandaged and propped up
	by pillows.  He stares out the window.

				ZEKE
		Hey, son.

	Quincy turns, sees his father.  He turns back to the window.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Well, you made SportsCenter.

				QUINCY
		What do you want?

				ZEKE
		Came by to check on you.

				QUINCY
		After five years.

				ZEKE
		Don't remember that being my fault.
		Seems like you divorced me same time as
		your mom.

				QUINCY
		Look, I'm busy.

				ZEKE
		I can see that.  I know things look
		pretty bleak right now, but you can't get
		down on yourself.

				QUINCY
		I stopped taking your advice a long time
		ago, or did you forget?

				ZEKE
		No.

				QUINCY
		Good.

				ZEKE
		Quincy.  I know you left school early to
		throw your middle finger up at me.

				QUINCY
		And now I'm paying for it, right?  That
		what this is about?  "I told you so?"

				ZEKE
		You want me to fuck off?

				QUINCY
		Yeah.

				ZEKE
		Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say
		something.

	Silence.  Then.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		You're a better ballplayer than I ever
		was.  But you got a lot of other things
		going for you.  You're smart.  I always
		felt...I always knew that you could do
		anything you wanted.  You want to be a
		ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know
		you ain't like everybody else on that
		court.  You ain't like I was.  You got
		options.  That's all I ever tried to show
		you.

				QUINCY
		You're still trying to tell me what I
		should and shouldn't do.  How come you
		couldn't be the man you kept trying to
		make me?

	Zeke stares at his son, wishing he could satisfy him with an
	answer.

				ZEKE
		I just couldn't

	With nothing left to say, Zeke pulls open the door and
	leaves.  Quincy stares at the door long after it closes.

	  INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY



	A NURSE enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers.  She moves

	past the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing

	with flowers.  She pulls open the blinds and light floods the
	room.  She crosses back out.

	A toilet flush.  Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the
	bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his
	gown.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		And I thought this was gonna be awkward.

	Quincy whips around and is shocked to see Monica standing
	there, laughing.  She has clearly made an effort with her
	appearance.

				QUINCY
		Monica?

	He stumbles.  Monica quickly goes to him, catches his arm
	before he falls.

				MONICA
		I'm sorry.

	Quincy stares at her, completely thrown.  It's been five
	years.  An awkward beat.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		So, how you doing?

				QUINCY
		Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.

				MONICA
		I was.
			(smiling)
		I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.

	Quincy rubs his goatee self-consciously.

				QUINCY
		Just something I'm trying.

				MONICA
		No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.

				QUINCY
		Thanks.

	Quincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain.

				MONICA
		Shouldn't you be lying down, or...

				QUINCY
		I'm alright.  But you can sit.

				MONICA
		I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.

				QUINCY
		Yup.

				MONICA
		What are the doctors saying?

				QUINCY
			(shrugs)
		A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be
		back in six months.

				MONICA
		I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.

				QUINCY
		Not for Quincy McCall.

				MONICA
		I forgot, "Q-man."

	An awkward beat.

				QUINCY
		So, how's pro-ball, Europe?

				MONICA
		We won the championship.

				QUINCY
		Still working on being the first girl in
		the NBA?

				MONICA
		Well, I tried sneaking in after college,
		but they found breasts during my
		physical.

				QUINCY
		Funny.  I never did.

				MONICA
		Kiss my ass.

	Monica cracks up.  Quincy laughs with her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		I can't believe it's been five years.

	Quincy nods.

				QUINCY
		Tried calling you a couple times.

				MONICA
		Oh yeah?

				QUINCY
		Wanted to give you props on making First
		Team All-American.  And then when Magic
		retired, I tried calling you again.

				MONICA
			(lying)
		Must have been my cheap-ass answering
		machine.  It was always messing up.

				QUINCY
		Figured it was something like that.

	They look at each other.  The moment is building.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		So, when do you go back?

				MONICA
		Actually, I don't...

				QUINCY
		What do you mean?

				MONICA
		I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking
		about giving it a rest for awhile.

				QUINCY
			(completely thrown)
		A rest?

				MONICA
		Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun
		anymore.  You know?

				QUINCY
		No.

	He stares at her.  Into her.

				FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
		Quincy!

	Quincy and Monica turn, as KYRA KESSLER, black, 26 and
	beautiful, rushes into the room.  She wears a flight
	attendant's uniform.  She goes to Quincy, gives him a kiss.
	Monica reacts.

				KYRA
		I'm so sorry.  No one would switch
		flights with me.

				QUINCY
		It's okay.

				KYRA
		Why are you up?  Get in bed.

	She takes Quincy's arm, moves him to the bed.  Monica
	watches.

				KYRA (cont'd)
		Tell me you're going to be okay.

				QUINCY
		I'm gonna be okay.

	Kyra relaxes.  Then she glances over at Monica.

				KYRA
		Hello.

				QUINCY
		Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...

				KYRA
			(recognizing)
		Monica.  You grew up together, right?
		Quincy's told me about you.

	Monica smiles awkwardly.

				QUINCY
		This is Kyra.  My fiance.

	The shock hits too quick to cover.  But Monica tries.

				MONICA
		Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations.

				KYRA
		Thank you.

				MONICA
		I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great.
			(then)
		Well...I should go.

				QUINCY
		It means a lot that you came by.

				KYRA
		Yes, we appreciate that.

				MONICA
		Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your
		knee, and everything.

				QUINCY
		Thanks.

	Monica forces one last smile, pulls open the door and leaves.

	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE DAY



	Camille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up

	a couple pecan pies.  Monica enters.



				MONICA

		Hey.



				CAMILLE
		Hi.

				MONICA
		Need any help?

				CAMILLE
		I can manage.

	Monica nods and moves to the barstool.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Your sister's bringing the baby over.
		You should try to be here.

				MONICA
		Yeah.  Can't wait to see him
			(she falls silent, then)
		I just saw Quincy.

				CAMILLE
		How is he?

				MONICA
		Engaged.

				CAMILLE
		To that stewardess?

				MONICA
		Yeah, you met her?

				CAMILLE
		His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago.
		He could do a lot better if you ask me.

				MONICA
		Maybe she is.

	Camille looks up, studies Monica for a moment.

				CAMILLE
		I thought you were over him.

	Monica shrugs.

				MONICA
		So what do I do?

				CAMILLE
		Find out where they're registered and
		send them a gift.

				MONICA
			(disgusted)
		Whatever.

				CAMILLE
		You didn't want my opinion in the first
		place, so why even ask?

				MONICA
		I asked but why does it always have to be
		so damn prissy.

				CAMILLE
		Don't curse.

				MONICA
		There you go.

				CAMILLE
		What do you want me to tell you, Monica,
		to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex
		with him?  I'm not going to do that.
		Yes, I believe thinking of other people
		is important and yes I'd rather bake a
		pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that
		makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.

	Monica stares at her mother.  There's no going back.

				MONICA
		So that's why we can't get along?
		Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump
		shot?

				CAMILLE
		You're the one always turning your nose
		up at me.

				MONICA
		No I don't.

				CAMILLE
		Child, please.  Ever since you were
		little you thought you were too good for
		anything I had to say.

				MONICA
		I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail
		polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray
		of your perfume.

				CAMILLE
		What was so wrong with wanting to teach
		you the things I knew could help you?

				MONICA
		Because you're pushing me to be something
		I'm not.

				CAMILLE
		So you're angry with me because you're
		standing here with your hair combed and
		wearing perfume?

	Monica is busted.  It takes her a moment to come back.

				MONICA
		I'm angry because I want a mother, not
		Martha Stewart.

				CAMILLE
		Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete
		whose mother is nothing but a housewife.

				MONICA
		That's not it.

				CAMILLE
		Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that
		because I know.

	Monica stares at her mother.

				MONICA
		I remember when I was eight years old,
		you spent like four hours cooking up this
		fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do
		was set the table.  And I guess you and
		Dad got your wires crossed or something
		because he walks in with a couple of
		pizzas.  And you didn't say anything.
		You just threw the whole meal into some
		tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.

				CAMILLE
		I don't remember that.

				MONICA
		I do.  You never stood up for yourself.
		Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because
		of that.

				CAMILLE
		That's ridiculous.

				MONICA
		What's ridiculous is not being a caterer
		so your husband can feel like a man
		knowing his woman's home cooking and
		ironing his drawers.

	WHAP!  Camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off
	Monica with a SLAP.  Camille curses herself for losing it.

				CAMILLE
		Dammitt, Monica!

	Monica is stunned, hurt.

				MONICA
		I'm sorry.

	Camille stares at her daughter, devastated.

				CAMILLE
		Is that really all you think of me?

	Monica can't answer.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		When I married your father, all I wanted
		was a nice house with a big kitchen so I
		could start my catering business.  And
		then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I
		got pregnant with you.  And I put it out
		of my mind because that's what you did.

	Monica stares at her mother.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		But you want to know what day I remember?
		In high school, you getting ready for the
		Spring Dance.  I put my pearls around
		your neck, told you you were beautiful
		and you looked like you were going to
		cry.  That day I was happy I didn't have
		a catering business to run off to.  My
		family had three meals a day, had someone
		to pick up after them, and when my
		daughters went to a dance, I helped them
		get ready.  That's what I came to care
		about.

				MONICA
			(softly)
		That's all you cared about.  I must have
		played in a thousand games and I can only
		remember you being to two.

				CAMILLE
		You had your coaches and your father for
		that stuff.  It never mattered one way or
		the other if I went to your games.

				MONICA
		It mattered, Mom.

	Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in
	her eyes.  Monica moves off the barstool and leaves.
	
	
	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY



	The room looks exactly the same.  Trophies, medals, plaques.
	Basketball posters and her "strong women" wall.

	Monica sits on her bed, staring up at a photo of her and
	Quincy, tacked up to her bulletin board, amid other photos of
	her childhood.  THEY ARE EIGHTEEN, PLAYFULLY WRESTLING OVER A
	BASKETBALL.

	Monica slowly rises, starts taking her posters down.

	INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

	Quincy sits on a leg extension machine, with his left leg
	tucked under the padded bar.  A TRAINER stands behind him.

	Sweat and pain coat Quincy's face and scarred knee as he
	slowly lifts the light weight again, and again, and again.

	INT. BANK - DAY

	A long line of customers shift impatiently during the noon-
	time rush.

	Monica sits with a BANK MANAGER at the "New Accounts" desk,
	learning the ropes.  Her hair is done, she wears a simple
	dress.  Behind her, hanging on the wall, are three framed
	photos of the bank presidents.  ONE OF THEM IS HER FATHER,
	NATHAN.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Monica stands in her room, staring out at Quincy's window.
	She watches as Quincy and Kyra pack up some of Quincy's
	stuff.  Quincy tries to take his basketball globe light. She
	laughs, "Hell no."

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY

	Camille enters, moves to Monica's garbage can, dumps the
	contents into her larger bag.  Suddenly, she stops.  She
	reaches into the garbage and pulls out a crumpled picture.

	Camille smooths it.  It is the photo of Monica and Quincy at
	eighteen, wrestling over a basketball.

	CAMILLE STARES AT IT, TAKEN IN BY THE PURE JOY IN HER
	DAUGHTER'S FACE.  She sits down on Monica's bed, still
	staring.

	INT. FORUM - DAY

	In the empty gym, Quincy jogs up and down the court.  He is
	still tentative on his knee, but he keeps jogging.

	And then, slowly, the determination melts from his face.  His
	jog turns into a walk, and then he just...stops.

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Quincy stands in the middle of his room, taking in his life.
	Old, worn basketball posters still line the walls.  Trophies
	and awards.  USC memorabilia.  His basketball globe light.

	He walks to his window, looks out at Monica's window.  Her
	room is dark.

								   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING

	Quincy tilts his face up to the shower head and rinses the
	soap from his face.  He hears the bathroom door open.  He
	shuts off the water and opens the curtain.

	Kyra sits on the toilet, taking a pee.  Quincy slams the
	curtain closed.

				QUINCY
		Damn, girl.

				KYRA
		What?

				QUINCY
		I don't wanna see that.

				KYRA
		Get used to it, babe.

	She flushes.  Quincy steps out, grabs a towel.  A long scar
	runs across his knee cap.

				QUINCY
		Brother's gonna have to start locking
		doors.

	Kyra laughs as she buttons up her flight attendant's uniform.
	They cross into:

	INT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Kyra packs up a suitcase.

				QUINCY
		So how long is this trip?

				KYRA
		Four days.

	Quincy nods.

				KYRA (cont'd)
		So are you going to be the kind of
		husband who won't let his wife work?

				QUINCY
		Nah.

				KYRA
			(playfully)
		Why not?

				QUINCY
		You might be the only one with a job.

				KYRA
		Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's
		going well.  You'll be back before you
		know it.

				QUINCY
		Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.
		Busting my ass, for what?

				KYRA
		To do what you love.

				QUINCY
		I don't know sometimes.

				KYRA
		You're just scared.  I know rehab is
		hard, and you have to worry about whether
		you'll be as good as you were but you
		will be.  I believe in you.  You just
		have to get back on the court.  Like
		you'd get back on a horse.

				QUINCY
			(beat)
		A horse?

				KYRA
		Don't make fun of me when I'm being
		wonderful and supportive.
			(then)
		You belong on the court.  Just like I
		belong in the stands, looking cute and
		cheering you on.

	She smiles, gives him a kiss, moves back to her packing.  Off
	Quincy:

	INT. BANK - DAY

	Monica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt, punching
	numbers into the computer.  A man sits down in the chair
	opposite her.  Monica glances up.  It's her father.

				NATHAN
		Hey, munchkin.

				MONICA
		Dad.  What are you doing here?

				NATHAN
		I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been
		hearing good things about you.

				MONICA
		That tends to happen when you're the
		boss's daughter.

				NATHAN
		So how's the job going?

	Monica forces a smile.

				MONICA
		You know.

	Nathan looks at her, nods.

				NATHAN
		I think I know what the problem is.

	He pulls a GARBAGE CAN HOOP from a plastic shopping bag.
	Monica smiles.  He attaches it to her garbage can.

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		There.

	He shoots an ugly, imaginary shot.  She laughs.

				MONICA
		You shoot like a girl.

				NATHAN
		I'll take that as a compliment.

	He gives her a smile, and exits.  Monica looks at the hoop,
	then crumples a piece of paper.

				MONICA
			(whispering)
		And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one-
		on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...

	Monica shoots.  The paper drops through the net.

				MONICA (cont'd)
			(still whispering)
		It's good!  It's good!

	She glances up, notices a few patrons watching her.  Monica
	quickly composes herself and goes back to her work.

	EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - DUSK

	Monica exits her car, after a long day at work.  She wears
	very low heels.  But she still stumbles.  She curses, then
	hears a laugh.

	She looks up - Quincy sits on the grassy hill above her
	house.

				QUINCY
		I remember when your mom had to beat you
		into a dress.

	Monica smiles.

				MONICA
		You visiting?

				QUINCY
			(nods)
		Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured
		I'd keep Mom company.

				MONICA
		Who's this guy I always see her around?

				QUINCY
		Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.

				MONICA
		So...how's the knee?

				QUINCY
		Getting there.

				MONICA
		Strong enough to get you down the aisle?

				QUINCY
		Yeah.  Two weeks.
			(then)
		I didn't get to send you an invitation,
		but if you...

				MONICA
		That's okay.  I'm probably, you know,
		busy.

	Quincy nods.  Awkward beat.

				QUINCY
		Can I ask you something?

	Monica looks at him.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		You never told me why ball isn't fun
		anymore.

				MONICA
		It just isn't.

				QUINCY
		Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.

				MONICA
		You had a rough couple years, that's all.

				QUINCY
		That a nice way of saying I rode the
		bench?

				MONICA
		And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is
		tough.

				QUINCY
		Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four
		and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of
		the attention, but besides that...

				MONICA
		You're serious.

				QUINCY
		Seems like I needed a ball when I was
		trying to be like my pops...or trying to
		be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I
		need to try something else.

				MONICA
		Like what?

				QUINCY
		Maybe go back to school.

				MONICA
		Wow.

	Monica stares at him, seeing a man in the boy she grew up
	with.  Quincy looks away, self-conscious.

				QUINCY
		I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school
		thing yet.
			(then)
		She'll probably say it's the painkillers
		talking.

				MONICA
		It's a trip, you know?  When you're a
		kid, you see the life you want, and it
		never crosses your mind that it's not
		gonna turn out that way.

				QUINCY
		So why'd you give up ball?

				MONICA
		Why do you keep asking me that?

				QUINCY
		Cause I don't get it.

				MONICA
		Something was just missing.

				QUINCY
		What?

	Monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.

				MONICA
		It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave
		it alone.

				QUINCY
		Find.

	Monica turns, crosses to her house.  She stumbles on her
	heels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside.
	Quincy walks back to his curb.

	ANGLE ON

	Camille watches from the kitchen window

								   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - PATIO - DUSK

	Lena sits next to Camille.  Her one year old son, L.P., sits
	on the ground at her feet.  Monica sits quietly nearby,
	watching.

				CAMILLE
		So you're still breast-feeding?

				LENA
		The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm
		still trying to lose some of this baby
		fat.

	She quickly looks over at Monica.

				LENA (cont'd)
		Shut up.

	Monica gives her a small smile.  Camille looks down at L.P.

				CAMILLE
		You might want to put a jacket on him,
		it's getting cold.

				LENA
		He's fine.

				CAMILLE
			(warning)
		Okay.

	Lena sighs, rolls her eyes.  She picks up her son.

				LENA
		Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too
		cold.

	She exits inside.  Camille makes a face.

				CAMILLE
		God.  "Grandma."

	Monica smiles.  And then silence.  There is still so much
	distance between them, so many misunderstanding.  Camille
	stares at her daughter.  And then...

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		You know, I'd probably be a lot more
		"prissy" in the situation than you'd
		like, but the thing I always admired that
		drove me crazy, was the fight you had in
		you.

				MONICA
		What are you talking about?

				CAMILLE
		When I said Quincy could do better, I was
		thinking about you.

	Monica stares at her mom.  Camille stands and leaves.
	
	
	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT



	Monica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to

	sleep.  Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her

	choices, her future...



	Suddenly, she climbs out of bed.  She wears a tank-top and
	pajama bottoms.  She crosses to her window, pulls it open and
	climbs out.

	EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

	Monica drops down.  She moves to Quincy's window and knocks
	quietly.  Beat, then Quincy appears.  Bare-chested and in a
	pair of shorts.  He looks at her, then pulls open the window.

				QUINCY
			(half-asleep)
		What's going on?

				MONICA
		We need to talk.

	Quincy just looks at her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Please.

				QUINCY
		Hold on.

	Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T-
	shirt.  He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground.

	Quincy looks at her.

				MONICA
		You asked me what was missing.

				QUINCY
		What?

				MONICA
		From basketball.

				QUINCY
		you woke me up to tell me that?

				MONICA
		It's not fun for me anymore because
		you're missing.

	Quincy stares at her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		What I'm trying to say is --

				QUINCY
		I heard enough.

				MONICA
		What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you
		since I was eleven and the shit won't go
		away.

				QUINCY
		We haven't talked since college and now
		you wait two weeks before my wedding to
		say something like this?

				MONICA
		I know, I probably should have said it
		two weeks ago.

	Quincy doesn't even crack a smile.  In fact, he glares.

				QUINCY
		You haven't changed.  You still think the
		sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well,
		guess what, it doesn't.

				MONICA
		Then why are you so upset?

				QUINCY
		Because you don't pull this on someone
		who's about to get married.

				MONICA
		Better late than never, right?

				QUINCY
		Wrong.

	Quincy starts back toward the window.

				MONICA
		I'll play you.

				QUINCY
		What?

				MONICA
		One game.  One-on-one.

				QUINCY
		For what?

				MONICA
		Your heart.

	Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the
	absurdity.

				QUINCY
		You're out of your mind.

				MONICA
		So you're gonna bitch up?

				QUINCY
		What's that supposed to be, psychology?

				MONICA
		I know why you broke up with me in
		college.  And not that what you did
		wasn't messed up, but what I did was,
		too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive
		you.

				QUINCY
		Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I
		couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I
		was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that
		was five years ago.  I moved on.

	Monica moves past him, reaches through his window.  She drops
	back down, holding his basketball.

				MONICA
		Prove it.

	She throws him the ball.

				QUINCY
		What will this prove?

				MONICA
		You once said the reason I beat you was
		because you wanted me to.

				QUINCY
		So?

				MONICA
		So, if I win it's because deep down you
		know you're about to make the biggest
		mistake of your life, and deep down your
		want me to stop you.

				QUINCY
		And what happens when you lose?

				MONICA
		If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding
		present.

	Quincy stares at her.
	
	  EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SHORT TIME LATER



	Monica stands opposite Quincy.  Both are suited up in

	basketball gear.



	They stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses
	him the ball.

				MONICA
		Check.

	Quincy tosses the ball back.  Monica drives.  Quincy's knee
	is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up.  She scores
	easily.

	She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		One, zip.  Check.

	Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back.

	The game continues.  Monica owns the first five points easily
	by exploiting Quincy's injury.

	Monica drives for another lay-up.  Quincy suddenly lets go of
	his fear, leaps and swats her shot.

	He grabs the rebound and lays it up.  He nods intensely, as
	he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key.

				QUINCY
		One, five.  Check.

	The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using
	his size and strength.  He scores seven straight points.

	The score stays close.  It is a sexually-charged battle of
	wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.  Their
	bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.  Monica yanks
	off her jersey in frustration.  Her ass bumps into his hips
	as she backs him in.  Her hands slide across his chest as she
	guards him...

	Finally, the score hits nine, nine.  Monica slowly walks to
	the top of the key.

				MONICA
		Nine, up.  Point.

	She tosses Quincy the ball.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Check.

	Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.  Monica
	fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.  Monica drives around
	him.  SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.  SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT
	ROLLS OFF THE RIM.  Monica can't believe it.

	Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.  He stares at
	Monica as he dribbles in front of her.  She stares back.

	He breaks for the basket.  Monica stays with him.  He goes
	up.  Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot.
	Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.  He lets go
	of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.  GAME OVER.

	Silence.  Quincy stares at her.  Monica looks back.  Then:

				QUINCY
			(pointed)
		All's fair in love and basketball, right?

	Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up.
	She slowly walks back toward her house.  And then:

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hey.

	Monica slowly stops, turns.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Double or nothing.

	Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy
	limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.

	Monica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other.
	No more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love.

	In the moonlight, on the blacktop, they kiss...

		So, Magic, are you contemplating another

		No more comebacks.  Tonight I'm just

	Behind him, in a second row seat, a ONE YEAR BLACK GIRL sits
	in a lap, bouncing, watching feet and legs ballin' on the
	court.

	Quincy leans down, gives the little girl a kiss, then looks
	out at the court.  It's the Los Angeles Sparks and the New
	York Liberty.  The WNBA.

	On the court, the women line up for a free-throw.

				QUINCY
		Let's go, McCall!

	Monica, sporting a uniform with Wright-McCall on the back and
	the number thirty-two, looks over.  Quincy takes their
	daughter's hand and waves it.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Go Mommy.

	Monica smiles back, then steps to the line.  The referee
	tosses her the ball.  Monica stares at the basket, then
	bounces the ball twice, licks her lips and shoots.

	EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - LATE MORNING

	An upper middle-class neighborhood, known as the Black
	Beverly Hills.  Big houses, green grass and Caddies in every
	other driveway.  The street is quiet, until --

				YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
		You wanna be Kareem?

	CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a
	basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven.  He
	sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger.

				QUINCY (CONT'D)
		All his big butt do is stand by the
		basket.

				JAMAL
		Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.

				KELVIN
		I'm gonna be like Dr. J.

				QUINCY
		I'ma be like my Dad.

				JAMAL
		He ain't a star or nothing.

				QUINCY
		I don't see none of your sorry daddies in
		the NBA.

				KELVIN
		Hey, look, Q.

	Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse
	All-Stars approaching from next door.  Walking in the kicks
	is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap
	pulled low.  A moving van is parked in the driveway.

				KELVIN (cont'd)
		Thought only girls were moving in.

				QUINCY
		That's what my Moms said.

				KELVIN
		I hope he can ball.

				JAMAL
		Bet he's a scrub.

	The Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway.

				KID
		Hey.

				QUINCY
		Hey.

				KID
		Can I play?

				QUINCY
		You nice?

				KID
		Yeah, I'm nice.

	Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then --

				QUINCY
		You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.

	Quincy tosses the Kid the ball.  The Kid pulls off the
	baseball cap.  Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown
	face and bright eyes.  She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years
	old.

				JAMAL
		Ah man, he is a girl.

				QUINCY
		Girls can't play no ball.

				MONICA
		Ball better than you.

	Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the
	driveway.

				QUINCY
			(whispering)
		What a dog.

	Monica shoots him a glare.

				JAMAL
		She heard you.

				QUINCY
		Nuh uh, they could only hear dog
		whistles.

	Monica starts to dribble.  Jamal whistles as he walks
	backwards, guarding her.  She throws up a shot.  IT'S AN
	AIRBALL.  Quincy and Jamal crack up.  Kelvin rolls his eyes.

	Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots.  Swish.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		One, zip.

	He rolls the ball to Monica.  She starts dribbling and again,
	Jamal just backs up with her.  She passes to Kelvin.  Jamal
	and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the
	basket.  Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.

	Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot.  It banks off
	the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.  The boys look at
	her in shock.  Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.

				MONICA
		One, up.

				QUINCY
		Lucky.

	Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.  He
	throws the ball back to Monica.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Two, one.

	Monica dribbles.  Jamal plays her a little tighter.  Monica
	bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.

				MONICA
		Two, up.

	Quincy can't believe it.  Kelvin cracks up.

				KELVIN
		Aaah, she dogged you.

				JAMAL
		Shut up.

	The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets
	for their teams.  Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is
	unable to stop her.  The score hits nine, nine.

	Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.

				QUINCY
		Point.

	Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.
	The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.

	Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the
	ball.  Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I got her.

	Quincy defends.  Monica smiles back at him.

				MONICA
		Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be
		the first girl in the NBA.

				QUINCY
		I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my
		cheerleader.

	Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket.
	Quincy stumbles, giving her a step.  Kelvin throws it back.

	Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up.
	In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving
	her off balance.

	THE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND,
	FACE-FIRST.  SHE GRABS HER CHEEK.  BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER
	FINGERS.

	The boys stand frozen.  Quincy stares down at her, his eyes
	wide with fear...and regret.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING

	Monica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes
	the blood from her face with a washcloth.

				GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Eeew.

	Her sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face.
	She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and
	painted nails.

	Her father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.

				NATHAN
		How are you feeling, munchkin?

	Monica nods.  He smiles.

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		Yeah, you're through.

				CAMILLE
		She needs to stop running around like a
		little boy.

				NATHAN
		She's alright.

				CAMILLE
		How is she alright looking the way she
		does?

				NATHAN
		Camille, she'll be fine.

	He gives Monica a wink, crosses away.  Monica pulls the
	washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood
	herself.

				CAMILLE
		I'll get some ice.

	She exits.  Lena shakes her head, follows.

	Monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the
	mirror.  TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK.
	Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left
	for this little girl to do.  She smiles.

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

	Quincy sits at the kitchen table, writing "I AM SORRY" in
	block letters across a homemade card.  His face is tight with
	concentration as he tries to write in a straight line.

	At the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store
	box to a cake dish.  She is 30, beautiful, with effort.  She
	smooths the frosting with a spoon.

	ZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer,
	enters.  He laughs.

				ZEKE
		Girl, who you trying to fool?

	Quincy looks up, smiles.  He quickly grabs a piece of
	crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke.

				QUINCY
		Alley-oop, Dad.

	Nona intercepts his pass.

				NONA
		Boy...

	She points him back to his card.  Quincy scowls, starts
	writing again.  Nona scoops some frosting on her finger,
	holds it up.

				NONA (cont'd)
		New neighbors.

	Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting
	off.

				ZEKE
		See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught
		me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me
		thinking I was getting a sister who could
		burn.

	Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss.  Quincy suddenly
	throws down his pencil in frustration.

				QUINCY
		I can't do this shit.

	Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.

				ZEKE
		Boy, what'd I tell you about using that
		word?

				QUINCY
			(sighs, then)
		"Can't" should never be in a man's
		vocabulary.

				ZEKE
		Why not?

				QUINCY
		Cause when you say can't, you ain't a
		man.

				ZEKE
		That's right.

				NONA
		Zeke.

				ZEKE
		What?
			(then)
		Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

	Nona just shakes her head.

				NONA
		We should head over.

				ZEKE
		Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a
		meeting.

				NONA
		With who?

				ZEKE
		Business folks.

				NONA
		You just got back from a four game road
		trip.

				ZEKE
		Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe
		two years left to play.  I'm just trying
		to put some things together for us.

	Zeke grabs his keys.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Later, Quincy.

				QUINCY
		Later, Dad.

	Zeke exits.  Nona leans against the counter, concerned.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Mom?

				NONA
		What?

				QUINCY
		We still have to go?

				NONA
			(beat)
		Yeah.

	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY



	Camille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes.  Monica and
	Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at
	each other.  A large bandage covers Monica's cheek.  Monica
	holds her card, Camille holds the cake.

				NONA
		...we moved back here when Quincy was
		about five, after Zeke was traded.
		Neighborhood was a little more mixed
		back then...

				CAMILLE
		Until the Black family down the street
		became the Black family next door.

				NONA
			(nods)
		Okay?

	Camille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair.  Monica
	moves her head.

				CAMILLE
		Well, thanks again.  This was really nice
		of you.

				NONA
		It was the least we could do.  And I love
		to cook.

	Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised.  She quickly hugs his
	face into her stomach.  Camille lights up.

				CAMILLE
		Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my
		friends' parties and things back in
		Atlanta.

				NONA
		You're a caterer?

				CAMILLE
		Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled
		and the girls get a little older, it's
		definitely something I want to do.
			(then)
		Since you love to cook, maybe it's
		something we can talk about.

	Quincy snickers.  Nona quickly changes the subject.

				NONA
		You know, girl, long as I've lived next
		door, I've never seen the inside of this
		house.

				CAMILLE
		Really?  Well, come on, then.

	Camille hands Monica the cake.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Honey, put this in the kitchen.

				NONA
		Help her, Quincy.

	Camille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and
	Quincy alone.  The two just stand there.

	Quincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it
	in his mouth.  Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop.

				QUINCY
		So...does it hurt?

				MONICA
		It's this big hole.  You could almost see
		bone.

				QUINCY
		For real?

				MONICA
		Uh huh.

	Quincy is impressed.

				QUINCY
		So how come you could play basketball?

				MONICA
		I just can.

				QUINCY
		I never knew a girl that could play.

				MONICA
		My Mom says she doesn't know where I come
		from 'cause I act different.

				QUINCY
		Your Dad play?

				MONICA
		He works at a bank.

				QUINCY
		My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says
		I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma
		play for them, too.  Same number and
		everything.

				MONICA
		I'm going to be number thirty-two, like
		Magic.

				QUINCY
		He's alright, but my Dad can take him.

				MONICA
		What was the most points your Daddy ever
		got in Junior High?

				QUINCY
		I don't know.  A lot.

				MONICA
		One time Magic scored forty-eight points,
		and they only had six minute quarters and
		he sat out the whole fourth.

				QUINCY
		You do act different.

				MONICA
		I don't care.

				QUINCY
		Well, if anybody bothers you, you could
		just tell me cause I run this street.

				MONICA
		I'd just tell my sister, Lena.

				QUINCY
		She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad
		showed me how to fight like Ali.

	He shows off a flurry of punches.

				MONICA
		So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."

	Monica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks
	and hand movements.  Quincy is impressed.

				QUINCY
		Bet you can't do this though.

	Quincy does a jump kick.  Monica does the same.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Okay, how bout this?

	Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel.  It
	looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake.
	The cake falls onto his head and shoulder.

	Monica doubles over, laughing.  Quincy is embarrassed.
	Camille and Nona rush back into the living room.

				CAMILLE
		Monica, what did you do?

				MONICA
		Nothing.

				CAMILLE
			(to Nona)
		Oh, all that work.

				NONA
		It's...it's okay.  Can I get a towel?

	Camille quickly crosses into the kitchen.  Quincy stares at
	the floor.

				QUINCY
		Sorry.

	Nona bends down, whispers in his ear.

				NONA
		No.  Good boy.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Monica sits between Lena's legs, grimacing, as Lena works a
	comb through her freshly washed, kinky hair.  Monica's head
	flops like a rag doll.  Her eyes are wet.

				MONICA
		Ow!

	Lena keeps tugging.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Ow, Lena!!!

	Monica punches her in the leg.

				LENA
		Ow!

	Lena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a
	yellow dress on a hanger.  Monica sees it and her face falls.

				MONICA
		Ah, Mom.

				CAMILLE
		I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your
		box of dresses under a pile of rags in
		the garbage.

	Monica sulks.  Lena cackles in her ear.  Camille has to
	laugh.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Child, pick up your lip.

				MONICA
		I hate it.

				CAMILLE
		Fine, you don't like this one, which one
		would you rather wear?

				MONICA
		Pants.

	Camille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door.

				CAMILLE
			(to Lena)
		When you're done can you make sure she
		brushes her teeth?

				LENA
		Are you okay?

				CAMILLE
		I just need to lay down.  I've been
		running around all day.

	Just then, Nathan enters.  He holds up two dress shirts as if
	it were a matter of life and death.

				NATHAN
		Which one for tomorrow?

				CAMILLE
		The blue.

				NATHAN
		You sure?

	Camille nods.  Nathan looks at both of them, then:

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		Can you iron both tonight just in case?

				CAMILLE
			(beat)
		Okay.

				NATHAN
		Thanks, sweetheart.

	He kisses her on the cheek, hands her the two shirts and
	crosses out.  Monica just watches.  Beat, then Camile turns
	back to her daughters.

				CAMILLE
		The boy next door is riding with you to
		school so you'll know somebody your first
		day.
			(to Lena)
		Hurry so she can go to sleep.

	Monica reacts, surprised.  Camille leaves.  Lena puts the
	comb back to Monica's hair.  Beat, then:

				MONICA
		Make it look nice, kay.

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Basketball posters, "Clippers" and USC memorabilia, a
	basketball globe light.

	Quincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his
	parents MAKING LOVE.  The sounds bring a smile to his face.

	Quincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear.  He moves to his
	window, sees Monica through her window directly across from
	his.  Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair.  Quincy
	kneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches.
	
	
	  EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - MORNING



	Quincy sits atop his BMX bike in front of Monica's house.  A
	basketball is tucked under his arm.

	Monica emerges, walking her banana-seater.  She is looking
	cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons.  A
	basketball sits in her back basket.

	Quincy is taken aback, stares at her.

				QUINCY
		You wanna be my girl?

	Monica blinks in surprise.  She thinks for a moment.

				MONICA
		What do I have to do?

				QUINCY
		I guess, you know, we play ball and we
		ride to school together.  And if you get
		mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.

				MONICA
		I don't like flowers.

				QUINCY
		Oh.

				MONICA
		How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever
		buy them.

				QUINCY
		Kay.

				MONICA
		Okay.

	An awkward beat between the new couple.  Finally --

				QUINCY
		I think we gotta kiss now.

				MONICA
		For how long?

				QUINCY
		Five seconds.

	The two glance around, then climb off their bikes and walk to
	the secluded area between their two houses.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Ready?

	Monica nods.  They lean in, eyes wide open, and touch lips.
	Quincy counts to five with his fingers.  They pull away,
	embarrassed, and walk back to the driveway.

	Monica lifts her bike from the ground and climbs on.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Wait.  Cause you're my girl now you
		gotta ride my bike.

				MONICA
		I want to ride my own bike.

				QUINCY
		My Dad always drives my Mom.

				MONICA
		So?

				QUINCY
			(impatient)
		So that means I have to ride with you.

	Monica doesn't move.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Come on.

				MONICA
		I don't have to do what you say.

				QUINCY
		Man, forget you then, stupid.

				MONICA
		You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for
		the worst team in the NBA.

	Quincy's face instantly clouds.

				QUINCY
		What?

				MONICA
			(laughs)
		Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

				QUINCY
		Shut up!

	He shoves her, knocking her off her bike.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I don't wanna be your boyfriend, you ugly
		dog!

	Monica leaps up, her dress now dirty.  She shoves him back.

				MONICA
		I don't want to be your girlfriend, big
		head!

	They grapple, then fall to the ground swinging...

	TITLE CARD: "SECOND QUARTER" then "1988"



	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY



	A snarling Black cougar glares down from a large mural.  On

	the court below, a girl's basketball play-off game.

	The bleachers are almost half-full with a hyped crowd.  In
	the crowd are Monica's parents.  Her father is excited and
	vocal.  Her mom reads a book.  Also in the stands, the HEAD
	COACH OF THE TENNESSEE LADY VOLS, PAT SUMMIT.

	A fine-ass BROTHER leans in the doorway, sporting a letter
	jacket with an embroidered "Q" on the chest.  He gets as much
	attention as the game.  A couple of JUNIOR VARSITY
	CHEERLEADERS smile his way.

				CHEERLEADERS
		"U", "G", "L", "Y", you ain't got no
		alibi, you ugly, yeah, yeah, you ugly.
		"M", "A", "M", "A", how you think you got
		that way, your Mama, yeah, yeah, your
		Mama.

	On the floor, MONICA, dribbles down court.  Just EIGHTEEN,
	her athletic figure has a few curves, but her loose jersey
	does little to show it off.  Her hair is a mess and her knees
	are dark with bruises.  A small scar is visible on her cheek.

	She whips a no-look, around the back pass to a cutting
	TEAMMATE under the basket, who scores.  The crowd cheers.

	Monica defends the opposing point guard like a gnat.  She
	knocks the ball loose and grabs it up.  She goes for a lay-up
	and the opposing guard steps in front of her.  Monica crashes
	into her, knocking both to the floor.

	A WHISTLE.

				REFEREE
		No basket!  Offensive foul, number thirty-
		two.

	Monica leaps up.

				MONICA
		What?  She wasn't set!

	The referee ignores her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		She was still moving!

	From the sideline, COACH HISERMAN waves frantically.

				COACH HISERMAN
		Monica!  Let it go!

	Monica stares down the ref as she jogs back on defense.

	The opposing guard drives the lane and puts up a shot.
	Monica leaps and blocks it with a taunting scream.  A
	WHISTLE.

				REFEREE
		Technical foul!  Number thirty-two.

	Coach Hiserman slams down his clipboard.  Monica charges the
	referee.  A teammate grabs at her but she pushes her off.

				MONICA
		For what?

				REFEREE
		Taunting.

				MONICA
		Taunting?!

				COACH HISERMAN
		Sub!

				MONICA
		Man, you suck!

	The referee whips back around, whistle in mouth.  Coach
	Hiserman grabs her arm and pulls her off the court.

				COACH HISERMAN
		Sit down and shut up.

	Monica slams down in a chair, sweat pouring, hands clenched.
	Her mom watches from the stands, completely embarrassed.  The
	brother in the doorway turns, leaves.

	Monica looks up at the clock.  SIX MINUTES LEFT IN THE THIRD
	QUARTER.

								   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATE DAY

	Monica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats
	on, her face dry.  She glances up at the clock.  TWENTY
	SECONDS LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.  Her team's up by SIX.

	Her teammates dribble out the clock.  The BUZZER SOUNDS and
	they dance across the floor.  Monica looks up in the stands.
	COACH SUMMIT IS GONE.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

	Camille, now forty-three, stands at the stove stirring a pot
	of gumbo.  Lena, 21, and pretty, stands next to her, holding
	a handful of plates and silverware.

				CAMILLE
		...and if you want a thicker base, you
		can cut in a potato or just use a little
		flour.

				LENA
		But you use potato?

	Camille nods as they cross into:

	INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	At the table, Monica is in mid-conversation with her dad.
	Camille and Lena start setting the table.

				MONICA
		Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.

				NATHAN
		And what am I supposed to say to the man?

				MONICA
		The coach from Tennessee was there and he
		has me riding the bench.

				NATHAN
		You lost your head.

				MONICA
		I was just showing emotion.

				CAMILLE
		So that means it's alright for you to act
		like that?

				LENA
			(to Monica)
		What'd you do?

				MONICA
			(dismissive)
		nothing.

				CAMILLE
		I don't know why I keep hoping you'll
		grow out of this tomboy thing.

				MONICA
		I won't.  I'm a lesbian.

	Lena chokes on her drink, cracks up.

				CAMILLE
		That's not funny

				MONICA
		Well, that's what you think, isn't it?
		Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an
		apron...

				CAMILLE
		Watch your mouth.

	Nathan quickly jumps in, tries to clean things up.

				NATHAN
		Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's
		time to start thinking about other things
		besides basketball.

				MONICA
			(taken aback)
		What?

				NATHAN
		You only have one game left and you
		haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I
		wanted it as bad as you did, but we have
		to face reality.

				MONICA
		The coach from USC is going to be at the
		championship.

				NATHAN
		I know.  But chances are...

				MONICA
		Chances are there's still a chance.

	Nathan nods.  She can always soften her dad, but not her mom.

				CAMILLE
		If you'd just listen for once, you'd
		realize you have a lot more going for
		yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty
		if you put a comb to your head.  I mean,
		why walk around with your hair looking
		like "whodunit"...?

	As her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window.

	OUTSIDE, QUINCY and a GIRL lean against a car parked at the
	curb, slobbing each other down.

	Just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is
	a brother who drank his chocolate milk.  HE IS ALSO THE
	BROTHER WHO WAS WATCHING MONICA'S GAME FROM THE GYM DOORWAY.

	Monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears...

	EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - SAME TIME

	FELICIA, 17, can't get enough of Quincy's lips.

				QUINCY
		Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.

	She keeps kissing him.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		And my mom's about to be home.

				FELICIA
		So I'm not good enough to meet your mom?

				QUINCY
		Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you
		up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.

				FELICIA
			(kissing him again)
		That's a lot of beating.

	She finally lets go, and slides into her car.  Quincy watches
	her go with a cocky-ass smile.
	

	  INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT



	A frenzied crowd from floor to ceiling watches Quincy explode

	across the court.  He is the complete point guard - hitting
	from the outside, driving to the hoop, no-look passes,
	playing tight D.'

	His father, Zeke, now 39, stands on the sideline.  His muscle
	has softened a little over the last five years of retirement.

	Monica sits alone in the bottom row, holding a basketball.
	She wears jeans and a T-shirt and her hair is pulled back in
	a simple pony-tail.

	Quincy does a killer cross-over move and his Defender falls
	down.  He lays up the ball, then taunts the player he just
	poster-ized.  Behind Monica, TWO GIRLS smack each other
	excitedly.  One of them, SHAWNEE, 17, pretty, big chest,
	slides down into the empty seat next to her.

				SHAWNEE
		Hey, girl.

				MONICA
		Hey.

				SHAWNEE
		Your hair looks so cute like that.

	Monica knows she's full of shit, doesn't respond.

				SHAWNEE (cont'd)
		So...you know who Q's asking to the
		Spring Dance?

				MONICA
		No.

				SHAWNEE
		C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's
		been creeping?

				MONICA
		There's so many I just can't keep track.

				SHAWNEE
		Well, can you give him this for me?

	Shawnee holds out a folded note.  Monica doesn't take it.

				MONICA
		Give it yourself.

				SHAWNEE
		I don't wanna look fast.
			(drops it in Monica's lap)
		Thanks, girl.

	She slides back to her seat.  Monica shakes her head, turns
	back to the game.

	Quincy dives for a loose ball.  Shawnee clutches her friend.

				SHAWNEE (cont'd)
		Good Lord, look at that ass.  I just want
		to lick the sweat off it.

	Monica takes in his tight body.  He does look good.  Quincy
	jogs back down court and flashbulbs go off...

								  MATCH CUT TO:

	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

	Flashbulbs.  Quincy stands with his dad, his sweat still
	fresh, talking to a reporter named JIM.

				JIM
		Quincy, word has it you might make the
		jump the NBA.

				ZEKE
		Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's
		college bound with or without basketball.

				JIM
		You could make a career by telling me
		where.

				ZEKE
		Gotta wait til the press conference.

				JIM
		But you'd love for him to play at USC,
		like you did.

				ZEKE
		I'd love for him to get a good education.
			(then)
		That's it.

	Jim crosses away.  Zeke puts an affectionate arm around his
	son as they walk toward the locker room.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		We should have another talk with Coach
		Carril at Princeton.

				QUINCY
		Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is
		going all the way.

				ZEKE
		I don't care about the team.  I care
		about the school.

				QUINCY
		Didn't we already have this conversation?

	Zeke sighs, then:

				ZEKE
		You played good.  I was proud of you.

	Quincy smiles wide.

				QUINCY
		Yeah?
			(then)
		So you up for a game later?

				ZEKE
		I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

				QUINCY
		You don't wanna hurt your back.

				ZEKE
			(smiles)
		Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting.
		Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.

				QUINCY
		You work too hard, Pop.

				ZEKE
		Let's hope I can say the same about you
		one day.

	Quincy watches his dad move toward the doors, stopping once
	to give an autograph.  Zeke passes Monica, entering.

				MONICA
		Hey, Mr. M.

				ZEKE
		Hey, Miss Baller.

	He exits.  Monica approaches Quincy.

				MONICA
		Way to hoop.

				QUINCY
		I know this.  What do you want?

				MONICA
		A ride home.

				QUINCY
		Your legs don't look broke.

				MONICA
		Look, big head, I'll be at your car.

				QUINCY
		Guess "please" would be a stretch.

				MONICA
			(dryly)
		Please.

	Monica sits in the passenger seat, basketball in lap.  She
	pulls Shawnee's note from her pocket.  Quincy glances it
	over.


				QUINCY
		What's that?

				MONICA
		Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give
		to you.

				QUINCY
			(thinks)
		Big-ass titties?

	Monica shoots him a disgusted look.  Quincy reaches out.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Give it here.

	Monica leans away, reads aloud.

				MONICA
		"Q.  I think you are so fine and I've
		been wanting to get with you.  Let me
		take you to the Spring Dance and I
		promise I'll leave you satisfied."

	Monica laughs in disbelief.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		What a ho.

				QUINCY
		Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she
		wants to get with me.

				MONICA
		She's a ho cause she's sending her
		coochie through the mail.

				QUINCY
		And?

				MONICA
		And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a
		nice guy and I wanna get to know you
		better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."

				QUINCY
		So she's honest.

				MONICA
		Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I
		guess you'll stick your dick in anything.

				QUINCY
		Didn't know you cared so much.

				MONICA
		I don't.

				QUINCY
		So who you going to the dance with,
		Spalding?

				MONICA
		Who's Spalding?

	Quincy looks down at the SPALDING BASKETBALL in her lap and
	cracks up.  Monica glares.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Fuck you, Quincy.

				QUINCY
		See, that's why you ain't getting
		recruited.

				MONICA
		Who said I'm not getting recruited?

				QUINCY
		Your hot-ass temper.

	Monica points to the scar on her cheek.

				MONICA
		I'm not the one who put this scar here.

				QUINCY
		God, here we go.

				MONICA
		When we were eleven years old cause he
		was about to lose.

	Quincy turns, faces her.

				QUINCY
		That's it, give it your best shot.

				MONICA
		Would you watch the damn road?

				QUINCY
		I mean it, give it your best shot, cause
		I'm tired of you holding that over my
		head.

				MONICA
		I'm warning you, don't tempt me.

				QUINCY
		I'm warning you.  You don't stall that
		bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.

	Quincy pulls his Jeep into his driveway.

				MONICA
		Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk
		smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But
		because I'm a female, I get told to calm
		down and act like a "lady".  I'm a
		ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.

				QUINCY
		With a jacked-up attitude.

				MONICA
		Didn't know you cared so much.

				QUINCY
		I don't.

				MONICA
		Good.

	Monica slams out of the Jeep and walks across the lawn to her
	house.  Quincy exits his ride.
	
	  INT. MCCALL HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - SHORT TIME LATER



	Quincy steps inside, drops his bag on the floor.  His mom,
	Nona, approaches from the dining room.

				QUINCY
		What's up, Moms.

	Nona holds up a large hoop earring.

				NONA
		What is this?

				QUINCY
		Uh, your earring?

				NONA
		I look like some hoochie to you?  I
		found it on your floor.

				QUINCY
		What are you doing in my room?

	Quincy crosses into:

	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Nona follows.  Quincy pulls open the fridge, grabs a couple
	of slices of cold pizza.

				NONA
		Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass
		girls.

				QUINCY
		We were just studying.

				NONA
		I'm not playing with you, these girls are
		looking to get you caught.  They see you,
		they see dollar signs.

				QUINCY
		Okay.

				NONA
		You hearing me?

				QUINCY
		I've been hearing you.

	Nona eyes her son, then lets up.  She gives him a kiss.

				NONA
		How was your game?

				QUINCY
		Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and
		still undefeated.

				NONA
		Still the man.

				QUINCY
		Yup.

	Nona smiles, starts back the kitchen.

				NONA
		Where's your dad?

				QUINCY
		Said he'd be home later.

				NONA
		Later when?

				QUINCY
		I don't know, he had a meeting or
		something.

	Quincy exits to his room.

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - ZEKE AND NONA'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

	Nona angrily rolls her hair as Zeke undresses.

				ZEKE
		I had some players to see and hands to
		shake.

				NONA
		At one in the morning?

				ZEKE
		I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a
		clock just so my wife doesn't get an
		attitude.

				NONA
		I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about
		to come second to this bullshit scouting
		job.

	Zeke looks at her, offended.

				NONA (cont'd)
		I didn't mean it like that.

				ZEKE
		Yeah.

				NONA
		I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found
		time for your family.
		You should see the tramps coming after
		Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...

				ZEKE
		I have.

	A beat.

				NONA
		You said you'd think about going back to
		get your degree.

				ZEKE
		No, you said I should get my degree.  I
		like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's
		gonna lead to a spot in the front office.
		Til then, don't worry, there's just
		enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci
		and gold.

	Livid, Nona pulls off her gold bracelet, throws it at him.

				NONA
		Fine, then how many nights home is that?

				ZEKE
		Keep your voice down.

	She grabs a pair of gold earrings from her jewelry box, nails
	him.

				NONA
		How about now?  I got a week yet?

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, as his parents
	continue to have it out.

	He rolls out of bed, pulls on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt.
	He moves to his window, pulls it open and climbs out...

	EXT. MCCALL AND WRIGHT HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy crosses the grass to Monica's window, knocks quietly.

	Long beat, then Monica sleepily stumbles to her window,
	wearing boxers and a tank top.  She pushes it open and Quincy
	pulls himself through...

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Now a routine, Monica tosses Quincy one of her pillows and
	blankets, then crawls back into bed.
	He lays out on the floor and closes his eyes.  Monica casts a
	long, sleepy glance at him, then drifts back to sleep.

	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - LATE DAY



	Posters of Magic line three walls.  A hand-made collage of

	female college and Olympic ball-players fills the fourth.
	The only real "soft" touch is the teddy bear laying on the
	pillow.

	Monica sits on the floor between Lena's legs, as Lena puts
	Monica's hair in cornrows.

				LENA
		That too tight?

				MONICA
		No.

				LENA
		Mom's going to hate it.

				MONICA
		Always on my ass, anyway.

				LENA
		Like you don't give her a hard time.

				MONICA
		Just cause I don't kiss her booty like
		you...

	Lena yanks Monica's head back.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Ow!!!

				LENA
		You need to.  She's alone in this house
		all day, taking care of Dad and your
		ungrateful behind.

				MONICA
		No one's forcing her.

				LENA
		Just try and chill a little bit, alright.

	Monica doesn't answer.  Lena yanks her head back again.

				MONICA
		Ow!!!  Okay!

	They crack up.

				LENA
		So what's going on with the Spring Dance?
		You have a date yet?

				MONICA
			(sarcastically)
		Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.

				LENA
		I found you someone.

				MONICA
		Found?  I'm not some charity case.

				LENA
		I know...

				MONICA
		Mom tell you to do this?

				LENA
		No.

				MONICA
		Damn, Lena...
			(then)
		Who is he?

				LENA
		This brother from my college.

				MONICA
		He's in college?

				LENA
		And he's fine, girl.

				MONICA
		How'd you get him to say yes?

				LENA
		I told him you looked like me.

				MONICA
		Oh, great.

				LENA
		You do.

				MONICA
		Yeah, right.

				LENA
		If you were tore up I would not be
		claiming you.  Trust.

	Monica is not convinced.

				LENA (cont'd)
		We'll do something cute with your hair,
		get you a dress, get you some heels...

				MONICA
		I don't know how to walk in heels.

				LENA
		Hey.  You just worry about playing your
		behind off for that recruiter tonight.
		Let me worry about your date.

	Lena starts to braid Monica's hair again.  Beat, then...

				MONICA
		You ever been in love?

				LENA
		Too many times.

				MONICA
		They ever love you back?

				LENA
		Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?

	Monica just shrugs.  Lena continues braiding.
	
	
	  EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATE DAY

	Quincy and Zeke sweat through a playfully intense game of one-
	on-one.

	Quincy almost breaks Zeke's ankles with a cross-over dribble,
	and leaves him in the dust.  He stops under the basket, waves
	for his Dad to come on before laying it up.

	Zeke smiles, tells Quincy to bring that shit on again.
	Quincy tries his cross-over again and this time Zeke picks
	him clean.

	Zeke taunts him as he easily backs in on him to the basket.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

	Camille stands at the stove, cooking up some yams.  Monica
	enters with a gym bag over her shoulder, dribbling her ball.
	THE HOOD OF HER SWEATSHIRT COVERS HER HAIR.

				CAMILLE
		Monica, please.

	Monica stops.

				MONICA
		Sorry.
			(then)
		I'm leaving.

	Camille fills a spoon from the pot, holds it out.

				CAMILLE
		Taste this.

				MONICA
		I can't eat before a game.

				CAMILLE
		Child, take a bite.

	Monica sighs, takes a bite.  It's good.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		I found some apricot chutney and mixed it
		with the yams.

				MONICA
		You really should be a caterer or
		something like you used to say.

				CAMILLE
		Sure.  In between all the other things I
		have to do.

	She pulls off Monica's hood, then stops when she sees her
	braids.  Monica looks back defiantly.

				MONICA
		What?

				CAMILLE
		Nothing.  So good luck.

	She forces a smile, turns back to her cooking.  Monica just
	nods, and crosses out.

	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

	The championship game.  The bleachers are almost filled.
	Nathan and Lena sit, dead center.  ALSO IN ATTENDANCE, COACH
	CHERYL MILLER - THE COACH OF USC.

	Quincy sits in the back row with a couple of teammates.  As
	always, he's the focus of much attention.

	Monica and her teammates are crouched in a tight huddle,
	surrounding Coach Hiserman.

				COACH HISERMAN
		I don't have to tell you girls how big
		this game is.  We worked too damn hard
		all season to leave without this
		championship.  So let's play smart...
			(looks at Monica)
		...let's play in control, and let's kick
		some butt.  Cougars on three.
		Once...two...three.

				TEAM
		Cougars!

	As Monica moves to center court, she glances up at the USC
	Coach, then at Quincy.

	Monica takes a deep breath as she lines up for the opening
	tip.  An opposing player suddenly bumps her out of position.
	Monica glares at her, but just moves over.

	The ball is tossed up...

								  SMASH CUT TO:

	INT. CRENSHAW GYM - NIGHT

	Fourth quarter.  One minute left.  Cougars down three.

	Monica dribbles down court, bouncing with confidence as her
	opponent plays her tight.

	Monica zips a no-look pass to a teammate, who lays it up.
	Quincy punches one of his friends - "Oh shit!"  She is having
	the game of her life.

	On the defensive end, Monica steals the ball.  She drives the
	length of the court, lays it up between two defenders.  The
	crowd is hyped.

	Twenty seconds left, up by one.  Monica hounds the opposing
	guard as she brings up the ball.
	Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose.  As she
	goes for the ball, a WHISTLE.

				REFEREE
		Reaching in, number thirty-two.  One-and-
		one.

	Boos fill the gym.  Monica's eyes widen.

				MONICA
		No!

	Anger rushes through her as she starts for the ref.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		That's bullsh--!

				COACH HISERMAN
		Monica!

	Monica catches herself, turns the word "shit" into a
	frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref.

	Monica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists.  The
	girl hits the first one.  Then, she hits the second.

	With ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court
	and throws up a prayer.  EVERYONE IS ON THEIR FEET AS THE
	BALL SPINS AROUND THE RIM.  AND THEN...IT POPS OUT.  An
	opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice
	but to foul her.

	Monica has just fouled out.  She walks to her bench and drops
	down.  She buries her face in a towel and sobs.

	The buzzer goes off.  Cougars lose.

	Quincy stares at Monica, feeling almost as bad as she does.

	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT



	Monica sits slumped on her bed in a bathrobe, as Lena stands

	in front of her, putting the finishing touches on Monica's

	make-up.



				LENA

		Might help if you didn't look so evil.

				MONICA
		I don't even want to go.

	She steps back, looks at her work.
  
				LENA
		Mom!

	Beat, then Camille enters.
  
				LENA (cont'd)
		Talk to me.

	Camille stares at her daughter, taken aback by how great she
	looks.

				CAMILLE
		Go in my top drawer and get my pearls.

	Lena exits.  Monica still looks miserable.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		You okay?

	Monica shrugs.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Well, can you promise me one thing?

				MONICA
		What?

				CAMILLE
		Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's
		game, the recruiters, or anything else.
		I just want you to enjoy being beautiful.
		Will you do that?

	Monica takes this in as Lena returns with Camille's pearls.

				LENA
		Here.

	Camille puts them around Monica's neck.  Monica looks back at
	her.

				MONICA
		You really think I look beautiful?

	Camille smiles at her daughter, nods.  Monica touches the
	pearls.

	INT. CRENSHAW GYM - NIGHT

	An R&B song jams through the speakers, filling the dance
	floor with high school kids in suits and dresses.

	In the middle of the floor, Quincy gets his groove on with
	his date, Shawnee.  She dances so provocatively, there is no
	mistaking what she has in mind for later.

	Over at the doors, Monica enters with her college date,
	JASON, 21, and fine.  Heads turn in surprise.  Monica feels
	the stares, shifts nervously.

				JASON
		Can I take your coat?

				MONICA
		You're cold?

	Monica starts to pull it off.

				JASON
		No, I mean I can check it for you.

				MONICA
			(embarrassed)
		Oh, sorry.

	Jason pulls off her coat, revealing a dress that shows off
	everything Monica has been hiding.  He checks out her frame,
	smiles.

				JASON
		Your sister wasn't lying.

	He crosses to the coat check, leaving her alone.

	ANGLE ON

	Quincy, who glances over from the middle of the dance floor,
	and abruptly stops.  He stares at Monica in shock.

				QUINCY
		Oh...shit.

	Quincy starts off the floor as a new song kicks in.

				SHAWNEE
		Q, I like this song...

	ANGLE ON

	Monica, sees Quincy approaching in his suit.  She quickly
	steadies herself on her heels, brushes a curl from her face.

				QUINCY
		See you made it.

				MONICA
		Yeah.

				QUINCY
		You don't look half-bad.

				MONICA
		You either.

	Jason returns.  Quincy looks at him, surprised.

				JASON
		What's up, Black.  I'm Jason.

				QUINCY
		Q.

	Shawnee suddenly steps up, slides her arms around Quincy.

				SHAWNEE
		Dang, girl, I didn't know Nike made
		dresses.

	Monica looks at Shawnee, wrapped around Quincy.  She can't
	believe it.

				MONICA
		Guess we'll see you later.

	Monica heads into the crowd with her college man.  Quincy
	watches her go.

	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATER

	Monica sits at a table with Jason.  His arm lays casually
	across the back of her chair.  Monica sits upright, stiff.

				JASON
		So, you like school?

	Monica smiles nervously, nods.

				JASON (cont'd)
		Yeah, high school was cool.  I don't
		remember sisters being as fine as you,
		though.

	Monica just holds that nervous smile.

				JASON (cont'd)
		So what do you like studying?

				MONICA
		Gym.

	He waits for more, but nothing comes.

				JASON
		I'm an English major.  You like English?

				MONICA
		Sort of.

				JASON
		Careful.

				MONICA
		Huh?

				JASON
		That was two words.

	Monica ducks her head, embarrassed.  Jason laughs.

				JASON (cont'd)
		Girl, how come you're so stressed?

				MONICA
		Sorry.

				JASON
		I mean, I'm having a good time with
		you...

	His arm slides off the back of her chair and onto her
	shoulders.

				JASON (cont'd)
		So tell me what I have to do to make you
		have a good time with me.

				MONICA
		My mouth is kinda dry.

				JASON
		Then I'll get you some punch.

	He stands, then.

				JASON (cont'd)
		Just don't jet while I'm gone and leave a
		glass slipper behind.

	Monica's face lights up.  Jason smiles.

				JASON (cont'd)
		There we go.

	He crosses away to the refreshment table.  Monica smiles
	wider, leans back in her chair with her legs splayed.  She
	catches herself and quickly crosses them.

	A couple of guys pass by and check her out.  Monica smiles
	wider.  Quincy steps up, holding two cups of punch.

				QUINCY
		Hey.

				MONICA
		Hey.

				QUINCY
		You having fun?

				MONICA
		Yeah.

				QUINCY
		Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.
			(beat)
		So who is this clown?

				MONICA
		He ain't Spalding.

				QUINCY
		Guess not.

				MONICA
		So you took Shawnee, huh?

	The DJ puts on "Make It Last Forever" by Keith Sweat.
	Couples move to the dance floor.

				QUINCY
			(embarrassed)
		You know, it was late and she asked...

				JASON
		You want to dance?

	Jason stands behind her chair.  Monica smiles shyly.

				MONICA
		Sure.

	Jason puts down her cup of punch, takes her hand, leads her
	to the dance floor.

	Quincy just shakes his head, then crosses to his table, grabs
	Shawnee's hand.

				QUINCY
		C'mon.

	He pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor.

	ANGLE ON

	Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently
	guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax.

	Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in
	closer.  Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands
	down his neck.  The heat from bodies grows.

	Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each
	other's eyes.  They start to look away but find they can't.
	Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel
	each other.  Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight.

	Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his
	hands lower down Shawnee's back.  The music continues...

	INT. JASON'S CAR - NIGHT

	Jason and Monica are parked up on Mulholland Drive.  LL Cool

	Jason has his arm around Monica, ready to make his move.

				MONICA
			(rattling)
		Freshman year, my free throw percentage
		was fifty-one percent, cause I was
		shooting it like a jump shot.

	Jason leans in, kisses her bare shoulder.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Um...but then sophomore year I was
		shooting seventy-five percent from the
		line.

	Jason kisses her neck.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		...uh, by keeping my feet set and really
		following through.

	Jason goes in for the slam dunk.  Kisses Monica on the lips.
	It's the first time she's really been kissed.  Jason pulls
	away, smiles.

				JASON
		That was nice.

				MONICA
		Uh-huh.

				JASON
		Your sister told me hands off, but I
		can't help myself...

	Jason leans in.  Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some
	more.  Monica tries to follow his practiced lips.

	Jason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down.  His
	hand moves across her breast.  Monica's eyes pop open.

				MONICA
		Wait...

				JASON
		Shh.  It's okay.

	Naive and inexperienced, Monica shuts her eyes tight.

	Jason's car pulls off, Monica slowly moves to her front door.

	She looks in the living room window.  Her mom is asleep in a
	chair, trying to wait up.

	Monica catches her reflection in the window.  She glares at
	her made-up face, then wipes at her mouth with her hand.

	She steps back , walks to her bedroom window.  She pulls it
	open, kicks off her heels and climbs through.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Monica moves to her bed and drops down.  She sits motionless
	for a beat, then suddenly feels something beneath her.  She
	reaches for it.  IT'S A LETTER FROM THE USC ATHLETIC
	DEPARTMENT.  Monica stares at it in her hands...

	Light suddenly cuts through the darkness.  Monica turns and
	is surprised to see Quincy standing in the middle of his
	room, pulling off his jacket.  Monica moves to her window,
	pulls it open.

				MONICA
		Psst.

	Quincy looks over.  Beat.  Then he climbs out of his window,
	drops down.

	EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

				MONICA
		Early night for you, isn't it?

				QUINCY
		I was about to ask you the same thing,
		going out with a college boy and all.

	Monica doesn't respond.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		So where'd you go after?

				MONICA
			(beat)
		Mulholland Drive.

				QUINCY
		Figures.

				MONICA
		So what dead-end street did you and
		Shawnee hit?

				QUINCY
		None of your business.

				MONICA
		Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left
		you satisfied.

				QUINCY
		That what you think?

	Monica shrugs.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Little after you left, I told Shawnee it
		was time to go and I drove her ass
		straight home.  And after she told me I
		was the dumbest brother in the world, I
		took off.

				MONICA
		Why?

				QUINCY
		Cause I don't just stick my dick in
		anything.

	Monica takes this in.

				MONICA
		I was sitting in Jason's ride with him
		kissing on me and feeling on me and it
		was really bugging me cause I couldn't
		remember how many offensive boards I had
		in the championship.  And then I guess
		she got tired of me sort of accidentally
		kneeing him in the balls.

	Beat, then Quincy cracks up.  Monica laughs with him.

				QUINCY
		Four.

				MONICA
		What?

				QUINCY
		You had four offensive rebounds.

	Monica stares at him, surprised.  She thinks.

				MONICA
		Hold up for a second.

	Monica disappears back inside.  Beat, then she re-appears.
	She climbs out her window, drops down.  Quincy looks at her.

	She holds out the envelope from USC.

				QUINCY
		When'd you get this?

				MONICA
		It was on my bed when I came in.
			(then)
		Can you just...?

				QUINCY
			(beat)
		You sure?

	Monica nods.  Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the
	grass.  Monica sits down beside him.  He tears open the
	envelope and pulls out the letter.

	Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in
	his face.  Quincy finally looks up.  Expressionless.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Damn girl...

	Monica's face falls.  And then, a slow smile spreads across
	Quincy's face.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		They want you.

	Monica grabs the letter, reads.  Her head just drops as a
	tidal wave of relief washes over her.

	Quincy smiles.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Congratulations.

	Monica looks up, cheesing.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I'm gonna be there, too.  I'm announcing
		tomorrow.

				MONICA
		I knew it.

	Monica can't contain her excitement.  Without thinking, she
	gives Quincy a kiss.  They pull away, then break into nervous
	laughter.

				QUINCY
		What was that about?

				MONICA
		I know, right?

	But they both want more.  They lean in, kiss deeply.  They
	fall back on the grass.  And kiss.  And kiss.

	Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up.  Quincy follows,
	instantly apologetic.  Monica stares at him, then to his
	surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with
	her finger.

	Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie.  He
	nervously unbuttons his shirt.  He fumbles with the last two
	buttons.

	Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self-
	conscious.  Quincy can't keep his eyes off her.

	He pulls off his pants.  Monica glances down and her eyes
	widen.  She looks scared to death.  Quincy smiles softly,
	leans in and gently kisses her.  She relaxes.  They lay down.

	Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom.  His hands shake
	as he puts it on.  They stare at each other as he moves on
	top of her.

	Quincy pushes inside her.  She flinches back in pain.  Quincy
	immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.

				QUINCY
			(softly)
		You want to stop?

	Monica shakes her head.  Quincy pushes inside again.  He
	looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her
	tears...

	TITLE CARD: "THIRD QUARTER"

	INT. USC - CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

	Championship banners hang from the ceiling.

	TWELVE YOUNG WOMEN sit on the first two rows of bleachers.
	The eight upperclassmen kick back in the second row,
	comfortable, confident.  Monica and the three other freshmen
	sit in front of them, jiggling nervously.

	COACH MILLER stands in front of the team.

				COACH MILLER
		I don't know some of you very well yet,
		and you don't know me because I'm still
		being nice to you.

	Laughter from the upperclassmen.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		But my philosophy is simple. Hard work
		and sacrifice.
		There's a lot of basketball history and
		pride here at USC, but just putting on
		the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a
		great player.  Hard work and sacrifice
		makes you a great player.  What you were
		doesn't matter anymore.  For the first
		time in your life, you won't be the best.
		You'll be going up against women that are
		bigger and stronger and better than you
		ever imagined.  So the question is, how
		will you respond?  Well, your answer
		better be hard work and sacrifice because
		that's the only way you're gonna make it
		through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and
		I teach it, "There is only one way to
		succeed at anything and that is to give
		everything."

	Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in.
	Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions.
	Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock
		curfew, no exceptions.  Always be on
		time, no exceptions.  Attend every class,
		no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no
		getting pregnant.  And finally, respect
		yourselves, respect your coaches and
		respect your teammates, right Sidra?

	SIDRA, senior point guard, nods from the second row.

				SIDRA
		That's right, Coach.

				COACH MILLER
		By the end of this year some of you will
		hate me...

	The upperclassmen crack up.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Some of you will want to go home...

				UPPERCLASSMEN
			(cat-calling)
		Cree!

	CREE, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly.  Coach
	Miller smiles.

				COACH MILLER
		But I guarantee you, if you work hard and
		sacrifice, all of you will be better
		basketball players and better people.

	Monica nods, accepting the challenge.

	EXT. TRACK - EARLY MORNING

	It's cold, it's dark.  It's six a.m.

	The team pounds down the track, pushing through a two-mile
	run.  Monica and her freshman teammate/roommate SHAYLA, 18,
	breathe heavily from the back of the pack.

	From the sideline.

				COACH MILLER
		Let's go, freshmen, you're getting
		spanked!

	Monica sucks it up, runs faster.  She reaches the middle of
	the pack, then runs out of gas.  She drops back to the rear.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Monica, I'm putting you on my Wizard of
		Oz team.  No brains, no courage and no
		heart!

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

	Defensive drills.  One by one, players crouch low and move
	backwards down the sideline.  ZVETTE, a junior guard, hustles
	through the drill.

				COACH MILLER
		Way to work, Zvette.

	Monica starts the drill.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Get lower, Monica, move your feet.

	Monica grimaces as she squats lower.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		I said lower!

	Coach Miller stops her, squats down low beside her.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		This is low, got it?  Offense sells
		tickets, defense wins games!

	Monica starts again.

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING

	The team stands along the baseline.  Monica stands right
	below the free throw line.

	TONI, 6'4", 200 pound senior, drives the lane.  Monica steps
	in front of her, and is slammed to the floor.  She lays still
	for a moment, stunned by the impact.  Laughter from the
	baseline.

				SIDRA
		Dag, you took her out, T.

	Teammates SANDRA and LISA crack up.

				SANDRA
		I think she just said "Mommy."

				LISA
		No, she said "mammary."

				COACH MILLER
		Monica, you trying to tell me you can't
		take a little challenge?

	Monica crawls to her feet.

				MONICA
		I can take it.

				COACH MILLER
		This time get your feet set.

	Monica moves back into position.  Toni drives at her again.
	Monica steps in front of her, braces herself.  Toni slams
	into her and she hits the floor.  Monica blinks back the pain
	as she pops back up.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Next!

	Monica wobbles back to the sideline.

	INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE DAY

	The team is spread out, lifting weights.  Monica lies on a
	weight bench, her arms shaking as she struggles to bench
	press fifty-pounds.  Sidra stands behind her, spotting.

				SIDRA
		You got it, c'mon, lift!

	Monica lifts it with Sidra's help.

				SIDRA (cont'd)
		That's it.

				MONICA
		Coach hates me, doesn't she?

				SIDRA
		She hates all freshmen.

	Monica scowls, discouraged.

				MONICA
		What's up with that?

				SIDRA
		Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't
		think just cause we play the same
		position we have to compete with each
		other.  We're teammates, okay?

				MONICA
		Thanks, Sidra.

				SIDRA
		Besides.  I've been starting point the
		last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb-
		ass freshman is taking my spot.

	Sidra walks off, leaving Monica with the bar on her chest.
	Finally, she has to drop the weight to the floor.

	EXT. USC CAMPUS - LATE MORNING

	Monica and Quincy walk to class, his arm draped casually
	across her shoulders.  Quincy gets looks and smiles.  Monica
	just looks exhausted.

				MONICA
		You finish the reading for E-con?

				QUINCY
		Yeah.

				MONICA
		What'd it say?

				QUINCY
		Basically broke down how I'm gonna make
		mad loot in the NBA, me being such a
		limited commodity and all.

				MONICA
		Whatever, big head.

	Quincy laughs.  TWO GIRLS pass by, smile.

				GIRL #1
		Hey, Q-man, you gonna take us to the
		Final Four?

				QUINCY
		We'll see.

				GIRL #2
		We'll be watching.

	The girls continue on.  Monica looks at Quincy.

				QUINCY
		What?

				MONICA
		You do see me standing here, right?

				QUINCY
		I can't be nice to a fan?

				MONICA
		Fine, Quincy.

				QUINCY
		I can't help girls coming up to me.

				MONICA
		I said fine.

	Quincy looks at her sulking.  He suddenly pulls her down onto
	the nearby lawn, and cradles her.

				QUINCY
		It's okay, little baby.

				MONICA
			(struggling)
		Quit.

	Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her.  Students pass by,
	laugh.

				QUINCY
		Shhh.  Daddy's here.

	Monica finally cracks up.

				MONICA
		You're such a punk.

	He gives her a kiss.

				QUINCY
		All these girls...you're the only one I
		know who's for real.

	Monica smiles, kisses him back.

				MONICA
		Always.

	 INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING



	A heated scrimmage between the women's "A" team (the starting
	five) and "B" team (five who want to be starting).  Monica
	runs point for the "B" team, playing opposite Sidra.


	Sidra is all over Monica, slipping in cheap shots, but Monica
	starts to come on.  She does a quick cross-over and loses
	Sidra.  She dishes off to Shayla, who scores.

				COACH MILLER
		Sidra!  You feel like playing any "D"?

	Sidra scowls as she runs down court.  She gets a pass in the
	corner, tires to make a move but Monica slaps the ball loose.

	Monica grabs it, drives to the three-point line, puts up the
	shot.  SWISH!  Monica stays posed, with her arm up.

	Sidra takes advantage, sprints back down court.  She get the
	long pass, lays it up.  Coach Miller blows her whistle.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Monica!  Get over here.

	Monica jogs over, sheepish.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		While you're so busy posing, your man
		just scored!

	Monica drops her head.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Show me again.

				MONICA
		What?

				COACH MILLER
		You love to pose so much, let's see it
		again.

	Beat, then Monica holds up her arm like she just shot the
	ball.  Snickers from her teammates.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		I want you to stand like that for the
		rest of practice.

				MONICA
		Coach...

				COACH MILLER
		I want you to stand like that until
		you're sick of it because I don't ever
		want to see it again, you hear me?
			(then)
		Dora, take her spot.

	DORA, freshman, jogs onto the court.  Coach Miller blows her
	whistle and the scrimmage resumes.

	Monica stands alone on the sideline, posing, and feeling like
	an asshole.

	INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

	Monica sits on the bench in front of her locker, dressing
	after the shower.  Shayla sits next to her.

	Nearby, Lisa and Sandra apply make-up in the mirror.  Zvette
	passes by, already dressed.  Lisa turns.

				LISA
		Z, I know you're gonna shower first.

				ZVETTE
		I don't smell bad.

				SANDRA
		And you wonder why your ass sits alone on
		the bus.

	Cree glances over from another sink, as she snaps the chain
	on her CROSS NECKLACE.

				CREE
		You guys curse too much.

				SANDRA
		Since when is "ass" a curse?

	MAEYEN walks past.

				MAEYEN
		Whoa, it's as big as yours.

	They crack up.  Cree just shakes her head.  Two TEAMMATES
	pass by Monica with their arms raised, mimicking her pose.
	Monica shakes her head.

	Sidra glances at Monica from her spot on the bench.

				SIDRA
		That's what you get for trying to show
		out, freshman.

				MONICA
		I was just playing ball.

				SIDRA
		You were trying to make me look bad.

				MONICA
		Didn't have to try very hard.

	Ears prick up around the locker room.  Sidra stands.

				SIDRA
		Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy
		seconds?

	Monica rises.

				MONICA
		What?

	Toni tries to step in.

				TONI
		Sidra, let it go.

				SIDRA
		Only reason you're here is cause Tonya
		Randall got pregnant and decided not to
		come.  They were done recruiting.

	KELLI, senior forward, shakes her head.

				KELLI
		That's cold, Sid.

				SIDRA
		Just thought the girl should know.

	Monica is stunned.  Sidra saunters to the showers.  Shayla
	nudges her with her shoulder.

				SHAYLA
		Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause
		she's bow-legged.

	  INT. USC SUITES - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT



	Monica and Quincy lay feet to face on Quincy's twin bed.

	Monica's hand holds an ice bag on Quincy's hip.  Quincy's arm
	rests across an ice bag on Monica's ankle.

				QUINCY
		Forget Tonya Randall.

				MONICA
		I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was
		here instead of me.

				QUINCY
		Then prove her wrong.

				MONICA
		I don't have it easy like you, alright.
		There's no red carpet laid out for me.

				QUINCY
		So you're gonna act salty all night?

	Quincy's roommate/teammate REGGIE, 18, suddenly pops his head
	into the room.

				REGGIE
		Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings.

				QUINCY
		Nah, thanks.

	Reggie shrugs, closes the door.  Quincy looks at Monica,
	still brooding.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Fine.  Don't worry about proving
		everybody wrong, okay?  You can't handle
		the pressure, I'll understand.

				MONICA
		That was so weak.

				QUINCY
		Who cares if you're never known as the
		first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more
		play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.

	Monica shoves Quincy's ice bag down his sweat pants.  He
	leaps up.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Aaaah!  Damn, girl!

				MONICA
		That's what you get.

	He smiles as he pulls the ice.  Then looks her up and down.

				QUINCY
		So how about a little one-on-one?

				MONICA
		What are we playing for?

				QUINCY
		Clothes.

				MONICA
		What?

	Quincy locks the door, sets up his indoor hoop.

				QUINCY
		I score, you strip.  You score, I drop
		something.

	Monica looks at him, then cracks up.

				MONICA
		Give me the ball.

				QUINCY
		My court, I go first.

	Quincy grips the ball.  Monica crouches low on defense.
	Quincy drives past her and slams down a vicious dunk.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Strip.

	Monica makes a face, then pulls off her sweatshirt.  Quincy
	skips back.  Monica drops low again.  Quincy fakes her out
	and slams down another vicious dunk.  He laughs.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Where's the "D"?

				MONICA
		Kiss my booty.

				QUINCY
		Plan to.

	Monica glares through her smile, then pulls off her T-shirt,
	leaving her in a bra and shorts.

	Quincy goes for another dunk, but this time, Monica reaches
	out, GRABS HIS DICK.  Quincy drops the ball.  Monica picks it
	up and lays it in.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hold up...

				MONICA
		All's fair in love and basketball.
		Strip.

	Quincy pulls off his shirt.  Monica moves back into position.
	Quincy drops down low.  Monica fakes, gets him to leave his
	feet.  She slips under him and scores.  She laughs.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Too bad you got your mama's height, huh.

	Quincy pulls off his sweats, leaving him in just drawers.
	Monica takes in the view as she moves back into position.

	She holds the ball out, taunting.  Quincy pretends to reach
	for it, but grabs her breast instead.

				QUINCY
		Oh, my bad.

	She drives.  Quincy just steps out of the way and lets her
	score.  Monica snatches the ball off the floor.

				MONICA
		Yo, where's the "D"?

				QUINCY
		Right here.

	Monica turns, finds Quincy butt-naked.  He moves her against
	the wall and kisses her.  Monica drops the ball, wraps her
	arms around him.  She smiles.

				MONICA
		I won.

				QUINCY
		I wanted you to.

	Game over.  They hit it.
	
	
	  INT. ESPN STUDIOS



	Sportscaster DICK VITALE talks animatedly about the upcoming
	season.

				DICK VITALE
		It's the start of the new college season
		and I'm like a kid in a candy store.  Too
		many great teams to choose from.  You
		have your Dukes', Kentuckys', Arkansas',
		but my surprise treat this season...

	INT. BASKETBALL COURT

	Sportscaster ROBIN ROBERTS reports on the upcoming women's
	season.

				ROBIN ROBERTS
		...USC.  The women of Troy made it to the
		Sweet Sixteen last year and are returning
		four starters from that squad.  And many
		consider their recruiting class one of
		the best in the nation.  The highlight of
		that class,...

	INT. ESPN STUDIOS

				DICK VITALE
		...is Quincy McCall, one of my diaper
		dandies.  He's a real P.T.P., a prime-
		time player.  Every college in the
		country wanted him but he chose to follow
		in his father's footsteps and become a
		Trojan.  He's gonna have a lot on his
		shoulders this season...

	INT. BASKETBALL COURT

				ROBIN ROBERTS
		...but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if
		just one of her freshmen has a breakout
		year, they can go all the way.  It's a
		long season, anything can happen, but one
		thing is for sure...

	INT. ESPN STUDIOS

				DICK VITALE
		It's gonna be awesome, baby!

	MONTAGE:

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

	A hundred flashbulbs pop as Quincy jogs out to center court.
	The crowd goes crazy as...

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - NIGHT

	Monica sits on the bench, watching Sidra run the floor
	against UNLV, as...

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

	Quincy drives to the three-point line against Cal and puts it
	up.  It drops through the net.  He pounds his fist against
	the number twenty-two on his chest, nods to Zeke standing
	behind the bench, as...

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - NIGHT

	Coach Miller motions to Monica.  She jumps up, pulls off her
	sweats.  She jogs past Arizona bench and onto the floor,
	as...

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

	Quincy goes up for a dunk against North Carolina.  He jams it
	down, grips the rim, and pulls his legs up high, as...

	INT. KAISER ARENA - NIGHT

	Monica catches a long outlet pass.  She drops a no-look
	bounce pass between two Berkeley defenders, to a teammate who
	scores.  She jogs back, as...

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - NIGHT

	Zeke grips Quincy's head proudly, affectionately, as they
	walk off the floor after a game against Washington, as...

	INT. UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT - GAMPEL PAVILION - NIGHT

	Sidra crashes to the floor, immediately grabs at her ankle.
	Monica rises off the bench...

								 CUT TO:
								 
								 
	  INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

	Televisions hang from every corner, broadcasting various
	games.

	Zeke and Quincy sit at a bar.  Quincy is still hyped from his
	game.

				QUINCY
		...up and under between two defenders,
		with the left hand.  That's gotta make
		SportsCenter.

	Zeke just nods as the Bartender/Owner crosses over.  He is an
	ex-ballplayer named TERRY.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		They can't stop me, Pop...

				TERRY
		What are you having, Zeke?

				ZEKE
		Genuine Draft.  And an orange juice for
		my kid.

				TERRY
		Cross-over's looking good, Quincy.  I
		know your old man didn't teach you that.

				ZEKE
		Didn't need a cross-over to post you up.

	Terry laughs as he moves off to fix the drinks.  Something is
	on Zeke's mind, but before he can speak on it...

				QUINCY
		You know, the numbers I'm putting up are
		better than any freshman.  Some people
		are saying I'm a definite lottery pick.

	Zeke suddenly focuses.

				ZEKE
		What people?

				QUINCY
		You know, people.

				ZEKE
		Well, tell them to mind their damn
		business.  You're smart enough to get a
		degree.

				QUINCY
		I'm also good enough to go pro.

				ZEKE
		You know how much higher the play level
		is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to
		develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The
		NBA ain't going nowhere.

				QUINCY
		You came out early.

				ZEKE
		Your mom got pregnant and I had to make
		choices.  You don't have a choice.

				QUINCY
		Okay...

	Silence, then.

				ZEKE
		Besides, the sooner you go pro, the
		sooner you'll have to deal with the mess
		I'm dealing with.

				QUINCY
		What mess?

				ZEKE
		there's this thing out there.  This
		paternity suit.

				QUINCY
		What?

				ZEKE
		Some girl that's been hanging on at every
		party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's
		Daddy.
			(then)
		Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be
		the one who told you.

				QUINCY
		Tell me what?

				ZEKE
		I just told you.

				QUINCY
		I mean, it's not true, is it?

	Zeke stares at his son.

				ZEKE
		You got the balls to ask me that?

	Quincy can't hold his father's look.  Zeke shakes his head,
	hurt.

				QUINCY
		Sorry.

				ZEKE
		No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say
		it.  It's not true.

	Quincy looks in his father's eyes, knows he's telling the
	truth.

				QUINCY
		So what are you gonna do?

				ZEKE
		I want this thing to go to court, but my
		lawyer's telling me to settle.

				QUINCY
		Why?

				ZEKE
		A case like this could hang around for
		months and I'm up for this player
		relations job with the "Clips."  This
		gets out, false or not, no one'll touch
		me.

				QUINCY
		What's Mom think?

				ZEKE
		We haven't exactly been living the fairy-
		tale life the past few years.  Something
		like this happens, it either brings a
		family closer or pushes them further
		apart.  We'll just have to see how it
		plays out.
			(then)
		I'm giving her some space, couple
		days...

	Just then, a COLLEGE STUDENT approaches.

				COLLEGE STUDENT
		Yo, Q-man, great game.

				QUINCY
		Thanks.

	The student holds out a piece of paper, without even a glance
	to Zeke.

				COLLEGE STUDENT
		Can I get an autograph?

	Quincy nods, signs the guy's paper.  Zeke watches his son,
	the rising star.

	EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - NIGHT

	Through the windows, we see Quincy enter the house.  He
	glances around, then walks to the living room.  He sees his
	mom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn
	up.  He pulls open the sliding glass door.  Nona jumps, then
	sees Quincy.  She quickly puts her drink down.

				NONA
		You scared me.

				QUINCY
		Sorry.  You okay?

				NONA
		I'm fine.

	Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass.

				QUINCY
		Last time I remember you drinking was
		when Marvin Gaye died.

	No response from Nona.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		This about Dad?

				NONA
		Guess he talked to you.

				QUINCY
		Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later
		the truth'll come out.

				NONA
			(beat)
		Whose truth are you talking about?

				QUINCY
		Mom, we can't let something like this
		mess up the family.

	She doesn't respond.  Quincy studies her.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I mean, you believe him, right?

	Nona sits silent, humiliated.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Mom?

				NONA
		Just...leave it alone.

				QUINCY
		This is just about money, you know that.

				NONA
		Quincy, please...

				QUINCY
		I mean, how many times have you told me
		yourself to watch out for these ho's?

				NONA
		Guess I should have been telling your
		father.

				QUINCY
		So you're gonna take the word of some
		trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.

	Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him.

	Confused, Quincy opens it.  HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS:

	Zeke outside a party.  IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a
	young woman.  IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS.  AND YET ANOTHER,
	they climb into his car.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		What...what's this?

				NONA
		I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that?
		After all his late nights and "meetings"
		and I still needed proof.

	Quincy just stares at the photos.

				NONA (cont'd)
		I used to think I was lucky just to be
		married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too
		tired.

	Quincy looks stricken, but he moves to Nona, comforts her as
	she cries...
	
	
	  EXT. TRACK - NIGHT



	Monica sits with a devastated Quincy, high up in the
	bleachers.  In the distance, the clock-tower glows 10:50.

				QUINCY
		Don't put your hands in your pockets,
		hold your head up, always look a man in
		the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on
		his every word like he's God or
		something...

				MONICA
		I know he messed up, but that doesn't
		change what he's been to you.

				QUINCY
		What has he been to me?  I mean, he
		looked me in my face and lied like it was
		nothing.  Like it was easy.
			(then)
		And I'm standing there getting loud on my
		mom like she's the one with no sense...

				MONICA
		She understands.

				QUINCY
		He even had me wanting to play for the
		"Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.

				MONICA
		You're not stupid.

				QUINCY
		I know a lot of brothers dog their wives,
		I just never thought my pops would do
		some shit like this...

	Monica puts her arms around him.  They sit there, quiet.
	Monica glances up at the clock tower.  She reacts.  Quincy
	notices.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		What?

				MONICA
		Nothing.
			(beat)
		Why don't we walk to my dorm?

				QUINCY
		I'm not up for running into anybody.
		Let's just kick it here, alright?

				MONICA
		I...can't.

				QUINCY
		Why not?

				MONICA
		Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew.
		If I'm late, I don't suit up.

	Quincy looks at her, almost in shock.

				QUINCY
		Didn't realize you were watching the
		clock.

				MONICA
		I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.

				QUINCY
		Nah.  Don't sweat it.

				MONICA
		Quincy...

				QUINCY
		For real.  I should be alone, anyway.

	Monica reluctantly stands.

				MONICA
		Will you call me when you get in?

	Quincy nods.  Monica gives him a kiss.  Then she turns and
	crosses away.

	INT. MONICA/SHAYLA'S DORM - NIGHT

	The lights are off but Monica sits up in bed.  SHE WEARS
	BOXERS AND ONE OF QUINCY'S PRACTICE SHIRTS.

	Shayla lies under her covers across the room.

				MONICA
		I shouldn't have left.

				SHAYLA
		Go to sleep.

				MONICA
		You should have seen him, Shay...

				SHAYLA
		Mon, Sidra's out for one game, and you
		got the start.  But you get caught
		breaking curfew and Coach is gonna send
		your ass back to the bench.  You'll see
		your man tomorrow.

	Shayla's warning slowly sinks in.  Finally, Monica lays down.

								   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. TRACK - NIGHT

	The clock tower glows 12:30.  Quincy still sits in the
	bleachers.  Alone.  Tears fill his eyes as his world comes
	crashing down...

								   DISSOLVE TO:
								
								
	  INT. CAMPUS GYM - LATE DAY



	USC vs. Louisiana Tech.  The packed crowd is hyped.  Nathan

	sits by himself in the stands, excited.



	Monica sits on the bench with four of her teammates.  The
	rest of the team is lined up in front of them, including
	Sidra in street clothes.

				ANNOUNCER
		And now the starting line-up for your
		Women of Troy!  At center, a senior, Toni
		Noise!

	Toni rises, jogs through the line of teammates to the court.

				ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
		At forward, a senior, Lisa Mason!

	Lisa stands, skips through the line.

				ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
		At forward, a junior, Zvette Mitchell!

	Zvette jumps up, bumps into each teammate as she moves down
	the line.

				ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
		At guard, a freshman, Monica Wright!

	Monica takes a deep breath, then jogs through the line.  She
	gets to the middle of the floor and looks around with her
	game face on.

				ANNOUNCER (cont'd)
		And at guard, a sophomore, Sandra Perez!

	Sandra jogs out and the rest of the team follows.  Everyone
	gathers in a tight circle with their arms around each other.

				TONI
		Look y'all, we got all these people here
		to see big-bad, La Tech.  We need to let
		them know that this is our house.  So
		everybody better leave everything out on
		that floor, you got that?  Ready?  One,
		two, three....

				TEAM
		Team!

								  SMASH CUT TO:

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - LATE DAY

	A sellout crowd for the men's SC/Temple game.  And Quincy is
	having the worst game of his life.

	He drives down court on a fast break.  He ignores his two
	open teammates and puts up a three-pointer.  It hits nothing
	but air.  The crowd boos.

	Humiliated, Quincy tries to steal the ball back and commits a
	stupid foul.  His teammates glare at him as they line up for
	free throws.

	INT. CAMPUS GYM - CONTINUOUS

	Monica's game.  Late second half.  SC down two.

	Monica drives the lane, drawing two defenders.  She looks
	like she's about to force up a shot, then suddenly whips up a
	pass to a wide-open Sandra at the three-point line.  Nothing
	but net.  SC up one.

	Coach Miller claps intensely on the sideline.

				COACH MILLER
		That's it, that's it!

	Ten seconds left.  Game on the line.  Monica tries to lob a
	pass inside to Toni.  The pass is knocked away and grabbed up
	by the opposing point guard.

	It is a one-on-one between Monica and the guard.  The girl
	drives hard for the winning hoop.  Monica races to the key
	and slides in front of her.  The guard goes up and slams into
	Monica.  Both crash to the floor as the ball drops through
	the net and the buzzer goes off.

	A WHISTLE.  The two women stare up at the REFEREE from the
	floor.  And then --

				REFEREE
		Offensive foul!  Charging!  No basket!

	Monica leaps up as the crowd goes crazy.  Toni grabs up
	Monica in a hug as their teammates celebrate around them.

	INT. SPORTS ARENA - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy drags himself to his bench, slumps down dejectedly, as
	the Temple Owls celebrate their win around him.

	INT. LOCKER ROOM - DUSK

	The female players continue to celebrate as they undress.

				MAEYEN
		Shoot, you see that crowd?  We need to be
		playing in the Sports Arena.

				KELLI
		Hell yeah.

	They give each other a pound.

	Lisa looks at Monica, standing in her shorts and sports bra.

				LISA
		Oh damn, Mon.

				MONICA
		What?

				LISA
		I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis
		with that charge.

	The women break into laughter.  Monica smiles.

				MONICA
		Kiss my ass.

				SANDRA
		Nah, I think she took that too.

				MONICA
		Sandra, please, last time you chest-
		bumped me, it took you three tries.

	More laughter.  Monica looks over at Toni, sitting quietly at
	the bench.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Yo, T, why you so quiet?

				TONI
			(beat)
		I don't want to go play overseas.

				DORA
		I thought you were hyped about going to
		Portugal next year.

				TONI
		It's never gonna be like this.  Playing
		in front of my family, hanging out with
		my girls.  Probably not even a
		McDonald's.

				SANDRA
		Nah, there's always a McDonald's.

				SIDRA
		Least you got an offer.  My agent's
		still looking.

				CREE
			(to Lisa)
		What about you?

				LISA
			(beat)
		Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day
		I could come back here and play.  But for
		right now, it's law school.

				COACH MILLER (O.S.)
		Monica.

	Monica turns, sees Coach Miller standing in her office
	doorway.  She motions for her.  Monica heads over.  Sidra
	watches.

	INT. COACH MILLER'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

	Trophies, plaques and photos fill every empty space.

	Coach Miller sits behind her desk.  Monica stands before her.

				COACH MILLER
		You could've given up after you threw
		that ball away.  But you kept your head
		and you showed real heart.

				MONICA
		Thanks.

				COACH MILLER
		We've got our final games against Oregon
		and Oregon State and I want to shake
		things up a bit, so I'm starting you at
		point again.

				MONICA
			(confused)
		I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next
		game.

				COACH MILLER
		You want the job or not?

	Realization finally hits.

				MONICA
		Yeah.  Yes.

	Monica looks at Coach Miller completely thrown.

				COACH MILLER
		What?

				MONICA
		It's just...it seems like you're always
		yelling at me.

				COACH MILLER
		You think I'd go hoarse for a player with
		no potential?   When I ignore you, that's
		when you worry.
			(then)
		Go get dressed.

	Monica nods, crosses out.

	INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	As Monica walks back to her teammates, Coach Miller steps
	into the doorway.

				COACH MILLER
		Sidra.

	Sidra looks at Monica as she rises, crosses over.  Monica
	avoids her eyes as they pass.  Sidra enters the office and
	the door closes.

				SHAYLA
		Yo sis, what's going on?

	Beat, then Monica smiles.

								  SMASH CUT TO:
								
								
	  INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT



	Black folks pack the cramped houseparty, bumping to a phat

	hip hop joint.



	Monica bounces through the throng.  A GIRL grabs her arm.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Yo, great game.

				MONICA
		Thanks.

	Another PARTY-GOER grabs her arm.

				PARTY-GOER
		Girl, you can play.

	Monica smiles wider.  She spots Reggie dancing in the crowd,
	moves to him.

				MONICA
		Reg.  You seen Quincy?

				REGGIE
		What's up, girl.

				MONICA
			(louder)
		Derek said Q was here.

				REGGIE
		We'll roll through.

	Monica is suddenly pulled into a dance routine by Sandra and
	Lisa.

	She laughs, tires to move away, but they won't let her go.
	Monica gives in, grooves with them.

	ANGLE ON:

	Quincy walks through the door with a half-empty forty in his
	hand.  Girls immediately try to grab his attention from the
	dance floor, or stare him down from the sidelines.

	Quincy sees Monica on the dance floor.  He stands, watching
	her.  Takes a drink.  Monica finally looks over, sees him.
	She smiles, crosses to him.

				MONICA
		Hey.

				QUINCY
		What's up?

				MONICA
		I've been trying to find you all day.

				QUINCY
		Here I am.

	She glances at the forty in his hand.

				MONICA
		Sorry about your game.

				QUINCY
		It happens, right...

	Shayla suddenly grabs Monica from behind.

				SHAYLA
			(to Monica)
		What's up, superstar.
			(then, to Quincy)
		Your girl was on tonight.  She tell you?

				QUINCY
			(beat)
		I heard.

				SHAYLA
		She also tell you she ganked the starting
		spot from Sidra?

	Monica looks at him for a reaction.

				QUINCY
		Nah.

	He downs the last of his forty.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Where's the keg at?

				SHAYLA
		Balcony.

	He heads for the glass doors.  Monica and Shayla follow.

	EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

	Reggie approaches the group.  Gives Quincy a nod.

				REGGIE
		What's up, dog?
			(to Shayla)
		Hey, flyness.

				SHAYLA
		Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a
		ho.

	He laughs, then turns back to Quincy.

				REGGIE
		Coach is gonna kill us in practice
		tomorrow.  Might even pull his lips off
		your dick, limp as your game was tonight.

	Quincy just looks at him.

				QUINCY
		That's funny.

	Monica leans against Quincy, affectionately.

				MONICA
		he's just playing, Q...

				QUINCY
		You think for once we could talk about
		something besides basketball?

				SHAYLA
		Sure.

				REGGIE
		Whatever's clever.

	Silence.  Reggie and Shayla crack up.  Quincy shakes his
	head, moves to the keg line.

				MONICA
		Y'all need to quit.

	She starts for Quincy

				SIDRA (O.S.)
		Monica.

	Monica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway.  There
	is no escaping this confrontation.  She glances at Quincy,
	then crosses over.  Quincy turns, sees her disappear back
	inside.

	INT. HOUSEPARTY - CONTINUOUS

				MONICA
		What's up?

				SIDRA
		Just wanted to say good game.

				MONICA
		But?

				SIDRA
		No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take
		that charge.

				MONICA
		Thanks.

				SIDRA
		But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni.
		Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.

	Monica shakes her head.  An awkward silence.

				SIDRA (cont'd)
		I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed.

				MONICA
		I know.

				SIDRA
		Just one word of advice for next season.

				MONICA
		What's that?

				SIDRA
		Never let a freshman take your spot.

	Sidra turns and walks away.

	EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy takes one long drink from his cup.  KERRY, 20, and
	spandexed, stands directly in front of him, flirtatiously.

				KERRY
		Excuse me.

				QUINCY
		Excuse me.

	He steps aside as she tries to work the keg.  Nothing comes
	out.  She nods at his cup, smiles.

				KERRY
		If that's the last beer, you and I are
		sharing.

	Shayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of
	times.  Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up.

				KERRY (cont'd)
		I like watching you play.  Number twenty-
		two.

				QUINCY
		Guess you didn't see the game.

	Quincy knows he should blow her off, but he's digging the
	attention.  He hands her back her cup.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		What's your name?

				KERRY
		Kerry.

				QUINCY
		Q.

				KERRY
		I know.

	ANGLE ON

	Monica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the
	hoochie.  The girl looks too damn comfortable.  Monica moves
	back outside.

				KERRY (cont'd)
		I'll see you.  Q-man.

	She swishes past Monica.  Shayla "accidentally" bumps her.
	Kerry glares.

				MONICA
		Who was that?

				QUINCY
		Nobody.

				MONICA
		Who's nobody?

				QUINCY
		Look, this party's whack.  You ready to
		go?

				MONICA
		You want to go talk?

				QUINCY
		Not really.

	He leans in, kisses her drunkenly.  She pulls away.

				MONICA
		We could finish what we were talking
		about last night.

	Quincy kisses her again.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Q...
			(pushing him off)
		Quincy, quit.  You're drunk.

	They fall silent.

				QUINCY
		You know what, I'm just gonna crash.

				MONICA
			(agitated)
		Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.

				QUINCY
		Nah.  I have curfew.

	He starts to walk away, then stops.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Oh, by the way.  Congratulations.

	He goes.  Monica stares after him.
	
	
	  INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Quincy pushes through his front door, then stops short in his
	doorway.  Zeke sits on the couch.

				QUINCY
		What are you doing here?

				ZEKE
		Your door was unlocked.

				QUINCY
		Still is, so let yourself out.

				ZEKE
		We need to talk.

				QUINCY
		We ain't got nothing to talk about.

				ZEKE
		I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I
		ain't that kid's father.

				QUINCY
		Lucky kid.

				ZEKE
		Look, I ain't saying it was right, but
		sometimes things happen.

				QUINCY
		And some things should never fucking
		happen!

				ZEKE
		Boy, you're so perfect you can look down
		on me?

				QUINCY
		I ain't a damn liar.

				ZEKE
		Your mom was real quick to show you those
		pictures, wasn't she?
		Well, she was nineteen when she got
		pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're
		the best thing in my life, but she knew I
		wasn't ready for no marriage.

				QUINCY
		So now you're saying my mother trapped
		you?

				ZEKE
		I'm saying I handled my responsibilities
		like a man.  But when you're in the NBA,
		you pull into a city and there's a
		hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And
		another twenty that made it past security
		on your floor.  And the boldest one is
		standing right at your door.  And after
		awhile, it just becomes part of the game.
			(then)
		I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't
		have.  But I did it cause I love you.

	Zeke looks at his son, meaning every word.  Quincy stares
	back, long and hard.

				QUINCY
		Since we're being honest, guess I should
		tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and
		going pro.

				ZEKE
		What?

	Quincy just stares back.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Quincy, you'd be making the biggest
		mistake of your life.

				QUINCY
			(sarcastic)
		From your mouth.

				ZEKE
			(desperate)
		I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't
		let you do this.

				QUINCY
		Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's
		vocabulary.

	Zeke is taken aback by the hatred in his son's eyes.  He
	turns and without another word, exits.

	EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

	Quincy stands across the street from the houseparty, staring
	up at the balcony.  Monica leans against the railing,
	laughing with a couple of teammates.  Quincy watches her,
	then turns and walks away...

	  EXT. CAMPUS GYM - LATE DAY



	SLOW MOTION.  Monica's eyes are on fire as she races an

	Oregon player for a loose ball.  Both dive for it, slide

	across the floor.  Monica grabs it up, screams for a time-out
	as her opponent tries to wrestle away the ball...

	EXT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - DUSK

	Monica walks down the hall to Quincy's suite.  The window is
	open.  The sounds of Nintendo are heard.  She walks in
	without knocking.

	INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Reggie sits on the couch with a TEAMMATE, playing Nintendo's
	"Duck Hunt".

				MONICA
		Hey, y'all.

	They barely give her a nod.  Monica crosses into

	INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy stands at an ironing board, ironing a T-shirt.

				MONICA
		Hey.

				QUINCY
		Hey, what's up.

				MONICA
		You weren't at my game.

				QUINCY
		Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this
		meeting with this guy.

	Quincy pulls on the T-shirt.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		You win?

				MONICA
		Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.

				QUINCY
		The "man" again.

				MONICA
			(smiles)
		Woman...

	A knock at the front door.  Quincy exits.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Monica follows, then stops short.  Kerry, the spandexed girl
	from the party, stands in the doorway.

				QUINCY
		Hey, you.

				KERRY
		Hi.

	Quincy gives her a hug.  Monica stares at him in disbelief.
	Reggie and his teammate smack each other, "Oh shit!"

				QUINCY
		Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica,
		Kerry.

				MONICA
		What the hell's going on?

				QUINCY
		We're going to get some food.

				MONICA
		Are you out of your mind?

				KERRY
		Maybe I should come back?

				MONICA
		No.  You stay, I'll leave.

	She storms out.

	EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DUSK

	BAM!  Monica slams her car door.  Her face is a mask of anger
	and confusion.

	Camille exits the house, car keys in hand.  She sees her.

				CAMILLE
		Monica.  What are you doing here?

				MONICA
		Didn't know I needed a reason to come
		home.

				CAMILLE
		Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised
		to see you.

				MONICA
		Dad around?

				CAMILLE
		He's still at the bank.

	Monica glowers.  Camille looks at her.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Everything okay?

				MONICA
			(clearly not)
		Yeah.

	Camille just nods, doesn't bother asking again.

				CAMILLE
		Well, I'm going to get dinner.

	She pulls open her car door.  Beat, then...

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		It's just a game.

				MONICA
		What?

				CAMILLE
		Whenever you lose, you get this attitude.
		But it's just a game.

	Monica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves.

	EXT. DORMS - NIGHT

	Quincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica
	slowly makes her way up the walk.  She sees him, stops.

				QUINCY
		Can we talk?

				MONICA
		Talk to your new girlfriend.

				QUINCY
		I just took the ho to Burger King,
		alright.

				MONICA
		Cheap date.

				QUINCY
		Least she had time for me.

				MONICA
		So you fucked around to prove a point!

				QUINCY
		I just said I didn't fuck around.  But
		you got your head so far up your ass it
		took a cheap date for you to notice me.

				MONICA
		What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your
		ass like everybody else?

				QUINCY
		You forgot to be there.

				MONICA
		That night you wanted to talk about your
		Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed
		to do?

				QUINCY
		Stay!

				MONICA
		If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!

				QUINCY
		Least you got your priorities straight.

				MONICA
		I never asked you to choose.

				QUINCY
		Never had to.

				MONICA
		I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what
		that means it should be you.

				QUINCY
		Well, if all you care about is
		basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck
		Dick Vitale.

	Monica punches the shit out of Quincy, then pushes past him.
	Quincy grabs her arm, stopping her.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hold up.  I'm sorry, alright.

	They stand, silent.  Trying to come down from their anger.

				MONICA
		How do I know next time you're feeling
		neglected or whatever, you're not going
		to run around on me?  If we're going to
		be together I have to be able to trust
		you.

				QUINCY
		I'm not asking for us to be together.

	Monica flinches in shock.

				MONICA
		What?

				QUINCY
		I'm going through a lot of shit right
		now, more than you have time for.

				MONICA
		How are you going to tell me what I have
		time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we
		can fix this.

				QUINCY
		I don't think so.

				MONICA
		You don't think so?

				QUINCY
		Look, I'm entering the draft.

				MONICA
		You're what?

				QUINCY
		I decided to go pro.  And who knows where
		I'll end up, you know?

	Monica's heart is sinking fast.

				MONICA
		When did you decide all this?

				QUINCY
		Few days ago.

				MONICA
		So that's it, just forget about us?

				QUINCY
		Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us
		anymore, it's about me.

	Monica is crushed.  Beat as, Quincy struggles to stay cold.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		But, you know, I'd still like us to be
		friends.

				MONICA
		Friends.

	She fights back tears.  Quincy has to look away.  Monica
	can't respond.

				QUINCY
		So...I guess I'll see you around.

				MONICA
		Uh huh.

	Beat, then Quincy turns and walks away.  Monica tries to
	fight her tears but her pain, hurt and confusion are too
	much.  Finally, she gives in, and the tears fall.

	ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF SPAIN



	Madrid, Pampolona, the running of the bulls, old-world
	architecture.

	Finally, we rest on a large billboard, a photo of Monica in a
	basketball uniform, drinking a Spanish soft-drink.

	EXT. STREETS OF SPAIN - LATE DAY

	Monica jogs down the congested cobble-stone street, a sports
	bag over her shoulder.  She is TWENTY-THREE.  Half-assed
	braids frame her matured features.

	She passes store fronts, street vendors, and dodges
	pedestrians, as she makes her way toward a large, older
	arena.

	EXT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

	An excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors.
	Above them, a huge banner reads "Campeonato de Europeo".
	(European Championships".)

	As Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a
	large contingent in the crowd.  Monica smiles, waves back.
	TWO LITTLE GIRLS break from line, run to her.

				LITTLE GIRLS
		Baloncesto!  Balencesto!  (Basketball!
		Basketball!)

				MONICA
		Oye.

	They giggle, hold out a piece of paper and a pencil.

				LITTLE GIRLS
		Autografo.

	As Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a
	matching sports bag approaches.  She is LUISA, Spanish, 33.

				LUISA
			(thick Spanish accent)
		Monica.  What is up?

				MONICA
		Oye, Luisa.

	Monica hands the girls her autograph and they run off.

				LUISA
		Large game, no?

				MONICA
		Si.  Large game.

	They duck into the arena.

	INT. ARENA - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY

	Paint peels off the walls.  Windows are broken overhead.

	Monica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles.  Her
	TEN TEAMMATES, all from Spain, sit on the surrounding
	benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish.
	Monica is clearly an outsider.

	COACH PARRA, Spanish, late 40's, enters.

				COACH PARRA
		Silenco!

	The women immediately stop talking.  COACH PARRA gives an
	animated, impassioned speech in Spanish.  Monica doesn't
	understand a word, just continues taping her ankles.

	Coach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up. Monica
	turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench.

				MONICA
		What did he say?

				LUISA
		He say to give the ball to you.

	INT. ARENA - NIGHT

	The arena is PACKED with a raucous European crowd, chanting
	and waving signs - the love their women's basketball.

	Monica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her
	shorts.  The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight.
	Her club's name is stitched on the front, "GODELLA".

	As she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her
	game face.  Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing
	Italian club is Sidra, HER RIVAL FROM USC.

				SIDRA
		Well, what do you know.

				MONICA
		What's up, Sidra.

				SIDRA
		I'm gonna love winning this championship
		in your house.

				MONICA
		How do you say "you're dreaming" in
		Italian?

	They move into position.  The ball is tossed up.  Italy winds
	the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra.

	Monica hounds her as she brings up the ball.  Sidra shoves
	her off and to the floor, and scores.  No whistle.  Women's
	pro ball is at a whole other level.  Bigger, better, tougher.

	The ball is passed in to Monica.  She drives down court, goes
	up for a lay up.  An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air,
	taking out her legs.  Monica crashes on the hardwood.

	A whistle.  Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes
	herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word.
	Without emotion.

	INT. SPAIN - NIGHTCLUB - LATE NIGHT

	A huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music.  In
	the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of
	the party.

	In a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching
	the festivities.  A large trophy sits on the table.

				SIDRA
		Can you take that damn thing off the
		table.

				MONICA
		You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.

	Monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm
	around it.  Sidra shakes her head.

				SIDRA
		Still a cocky bitch.

	Monica laughs.  She downs her drink, motions to the waiter.

				MONICA
		Uno mas, por favor.

	The waiter nods.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden.

				SIDRA
		Yeah, four years ago.  They had me
		staying in this tiny-ass town with like
		fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was
		about a thousand goats running around,
		and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then
		the whack club I'm on loses three games
		in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire
		me.

				MONICA
		Just like that?

				SIDRA
		Yup.  So I've been playing with this
		Italian club the last three years.

				MONICA
		How's that been?

				SIDRA
		It's better.  Even though the whole first
		season my teammates didn't pass to me
		cause they were mad "The American" was
		making more money.
			(smiles)
		I led the team in rebounds cause it was
		the only way I could touch the damn ball.

	Monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink.  She tries to
	pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away.

				SIDRA (cont'd)
		Most of us don't win championships our
		first year overseas.

				MONICA
		Please, I went through the same drama as
		everybody else.  I mean, the first four
		months, only person I could talk to was
		this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words
		of English from watching old "Dif'rent
		Strokes" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to
		tell her if she said, "What you talking
		bout, Willis?" one more time, I was
		gonna kick her ass.

	Sidra laughs.  They watch the madness out on the dance floor.

				SIDRA
		So what are these Spanish guys like?

				MONICA
		I wouldn't know.

				SIDRA
		What?  You've been over here seven months
		and you ain't tapped anything?

				MONICA
		Just not my type, I guess.

				SIDRA
		Shoot, Italian boys love them some black
		women.  They can't get enough of me.

	Monica smiles.

				MONICA
		You ever think about going back?

				SIDRA
		Sometimes.  But what's the alternative,
		not playing?  You remember big Toni?
			(off Monica's nod)
		She quit last year, now she's working at
		some bookstore.  I mean, look at us.
		They treat us like we're Hollywood stars
		over here.  We just played in the
		championship game.  It doesn't get much
		sweeter than this.

	Monica takes this in.  Her eyes do not reflect someone on top
	of the world.  She takes a long drink.

	INT. SPAIN - MONICA'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

	A small, sparse, one-bedroom.  Sam, Diane and the rest of the
	gang from "Cheers" fill the small TV screen that flickers in
	the darkness.  Their dialogue is dubbed in Spanish.

	Monica sits on the floor, braiding her hair.

	SHE WEARS BOXERS AND QUINCY'S OLD PRACTICE SHIRT.  AFTER FIVE
	YEARS, IT IS WELL-WORN.

	Feelings of loneliness threaten to swallow her whole.  She
	looks out her window and sees her billboard, looming in the
	distance.  She just stares.
	
	
	  INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT



	The crowd erupts as a Laker player dunks the ball on a fast

	break.



	ANGLE ON



	Laker announcers CHICK HEARN and STU LANTZ.



				CHICK HEARN

		Stu, this game is in the refrigerator.
		The door is closed, the lights are out,
		the butter's hard and the Jell-Oooooo's
		jigglin'.

				STU LANTZ
		And here come the subs.

	ANGLE ON

	Quincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the
	rest of the subs.  He is twenty-three, a man.  His goatee and
	tired eyes make him look older.  HE NOW WEARS NUMBER TWENTY-
	ONE.

				STU LANTZ (cont'd) (V.O.)
		It's good to see these guys get a little
		playing time.  And the fans love it.

	Quincy immediately gets a pass in the corner.  He puts up a
	quick three and it banks hard off the rim.

	ANGLE ON

	Chick and Stu.

				CHICK HEARN
		Three-pointer is off for the kid from
		SC.  Came out after his freshman year,
		now in his fifth year with the league.

				STU LANTZ
		The son of Zeke McCall, played twelve
		years with the Clippers.

				CHICK HEARN
			(nods)
		Pretty good player.  The kid's moved
		around quite a bit, but he's hoping to
		finally have a home with the Lakers.

	ANGLE ON

	Quincy steals the ball, has nothing but open court ahead of
	him.

				CHICK HEARN (cont'd) (V.O.)
		Watch out, folks, it's showtime.

	Quincy takes off from the hash-mark and throws down a monster
	jam.  He swings high off the rim.  Too high.  His hand slips
	and he crashes to the floor.  His knee twists at a sickening
	angle.

	The dwindling crowd gasps as Quincy clutches his left knee,
	writhing in pain.

	INT. DANIEL FREEMAN HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

	Zeke walks down the corridor, checking room numbers.  He is
	forty-five now.  His slight paunch as become a roll.

	He sees Nona exiting a room, with an empty water pitcher in
	hand.  Her hair is in locks.

				ZEKE
		Nona.

	Nona looks over.  Her eyes narrow.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		How's he doing?

				NONA
		Not great.

				ZEKE
		What's that, not great?

				NONA
		The doctor'll be back in a minute.

				ZEKE
		Nona, please.

				NONA
		He tore his ACL.

	Zeke's shoulders slump.  Then he looks back at her.

				ZEKE
		Almost didn't recognize you with your
		hair like that.  How you been?

				NONA
		Happy.  And he won't want to see you.

	Nona walks over to a MAN standing nearby.  He puts an arm
	around her and they move down the hall.  Zeke watches for a
	beat, then pulls open Quincy's door, steps inside.

	INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Quincy lays in the bed.  His knee is bandaged and propped up
	by pillows.  He stares out the window.

				ZEKE
		Hey, son.

	Quincy turns, sees his father.  He turns back to the window.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Well, you made SportsCenter.

				QUINCY
		What do you want?

				ZEKE
		Came by to check on you.

				QUINCY
		After five years.

				ZEKE
		Don't remember that being my fault.
		Seems like you divorced me same time as
		your mom.

				QUINCY
		Look, I'm busy.

				ZEKE
		I can see that.  I know things look
		pretty bleak right now, but you can't get
		down on yourself.

				QUINCY
		I stopped taking your advice a long time
		ago, or did you forget?

				ZEKE
		No.

				QUINCY
		Good.

				ZEKE
		Quincy.  I know you left school early to
		throw your middle finger up at me.

				QUINCY
		And now I'm paying for it, right?  That
		what this is about?  "I told you so?"

				ZEKE
		You want me to fuck off?

				QUINCY
		Yeah.

				ZEKE
		Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say
		something.

	Silence.  Then.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		You're a better ballplayer than I ever
		was.  But you got a lot of other things
		going for you.  You're smart.  I always
		felt...I always knew that you could do
		anything you wanted.  You want to be a
		ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know
		you ain't like everybody else on that
		court.  You ain't like I was.  You got
		options.  That's all I ever tried to show
		you.

				QUINCY
		You're still trying to tell me what I
		should and shouldn't do.  How come you
		couldn't be the man you kept trying to
		make me?

	Zeke stares at his son, wishing he could satisfy him with an
	answer.

				ZEKE
		I just couldn't

	With nothing left to say, Zeke pulls open the door and
	leaves.  Quincy stares at the door long after it closes.

	  INT. QUINCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY



	A NURSE enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers.  She moves

	past the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing

	with flowers.  She pulls open the blinds and light floods the
	room.  She crosses back out.

	A toilet flush.  Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the
	bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his
	gown.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		And I thought this was gonna be awkward.

	Quincy whips around and is shocked to see Monica standing
	there, laughing.  She has clearly made an effort with her
	appearance.

				QUINCY
		Monica?

	He stumbles.  Monica quickly goes to him, catches his arm
	before he falls.

				MONICA
		I'm sorry.

	Quincy stares at her, completely thrown.  It's been five
	years.  An awkward beat.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		So, how you doing?

				QUINCY
		Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.

				MONICA
		I was.
			(smiling)
		I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.

	Quincy rubs his goatee self-consciously.

				QUINCY
		Just something I'm trying.

				MONICA
		No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.

				QUINCY
		Thanks.

	Quincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain.

				MONICA
		Shouldn't you be lying down, or...

				QUINCY
		I'm alright.  But you can sit.

				MONICA
		I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.

				QUINCY
		Yup.

				MONICA
		What are the doctors saying?

				QUINCY
			(shrugs)
		A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be
		back in six months.

				MONICA
		I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.

				QUINCY
		Not for Quincy McCall.

				MONICA
		I forgot, "Q-man."

	An awkward beat.

				QUINCY
		So, how's pro-ball, Europe?

				MONICA
		We won the championship.

				QUINCY
		Still working on being the first girl in
		the NBA?

				MONICA
		Well, I tried sneaking in after college,
		but they found breasts during my
		physical.

				QUINCY
		Funny.  I never did.

				MONICA
		Kiss my ass.

	Monica cracks up.  Quincy laughs with her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		I can't believe it's been five years.

	Quincy nods.

				QUINCY
		Tried calling you a couple times.

				MONICA
		Oh yeah?

				QUINCY
		Wanted to give you props on making First
		Team All-American.  And then when Magic
		retired, I tried calling you again.

				MONICA
			(lying)
		Must have been my cheap-ass answering
		machine.  It was always messing up.

				QUINCY
		Figured it was something like that.

	They look at each other.  The moment is building.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		So, when do you go back?

				MONICA
		Actually, I don't...

				QUINCY
		What do you mean?

				MONICA
		I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking
		about giving it a rest for awhile.

				QUINCY
			(completely thrown)
		A rest?

				MONICA
		Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun
		anymore.  You know?

				QUINCY
		No.

	He stares at her.  Into her.

				FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
		Quincy!

	Quincy and Monica turn, as KYRA KESSLER, black, 26 and
	beautiful, rushes into the room.  She wears a flight
	attendant's uniform.  She goes to Quincy, gives him a kiss.
	Monica reacts.

				KYRA
		I'm so sorry.  No one would switch
		flights with me.

				QUINCY
		It's okay.

				KYRA
		Why are you up?  Get in bed.

	She takes Quincy's arm, moves him to the bed.  Monica
	watches.

				KYRA (cont'd)
		Tell me you're going to be okay.

				QUINCY
		I'm gonna be okay.

	Kyra relaxes.  Then she glances over at Monica.

				KYRA
		Hello.

				QUINCY
		Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...

				KYRA
			(recognizing)
		Monica.  You grew up together, right?
		Quincy's told me about you.

	Monica smiles awkwardly.

				QUINCY
		This is Kyra.  My fiance.

	The shock hits too quick to cover.  But Monica tries.

				MONICA
		Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations.

				KYRA
		Thank you.

				MONICA
		I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great.
			(then)
		Well...I should go.

				QUINCY
		It means a lot that you came by.

				KYRA
		Yes, we appreciate that.

				MONICA
		Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your
		knee, and everything.

				QUINCY
		Thanks.

	Monica forces one last smile, pulls open the door and leaves.

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Monica walks down the hall, shell-shocked.
	
	
	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE DAY



	Camille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up

	a couple pecan pies.  Monica enters.



				MONICA

		Hey.



				CAMILLE
		Hi.

				MONICA
		Need any help?

				CAMILLE
		I can manage.

	Monica nods and moves to the barstool.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Your sister's bringing the baby over.
		You should try to be here.

				MONICA
		Yeah.  Can't wait to see him
			(she falls silent, then)
		I just saw Quincy.

				CAMILLE
		How is he?

				MONICA
		Engaged.

				CAMILLE
		To that stewardess?

				MONICA
		Yeah, you met her?

				CAMILLE
		His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago.
		He could do a lot better if you ask me.

				MONICA
		Maybe she is.

	Camille looks up, studies Monica for a moment.

				CAMILLE
		I thought you were over him.

	Monica shrugs.

				MONICA
		So what do I do?

				CAMILLE
		Find out where they're registered and
		send them a gift.

				MONICA
			(disgusted)
		Whatever.

				CAMILLE
		You didn't want my opinion in the first
		place, so why even ask?

				MONICA
		I asked but why does it always have to be
		so damn prissy.

				CAMILLE
		Don't curse.

				MONICA
		There you go.

				CAMILLE
		What do you want me to tell you, Monica,
		to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex
		with him?  I'm not going to do that.
		Yes, I believe thinking of other people
		is important and yes I'd rather bake a
		pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that
		makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.

	Monica stares at her mother.  There's no going back.

				MONICA
		So that's why we can't get along?
		Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump
		shot?

				CAMILLE
		You're the one always turning your nose
		up at me.

				MONICA
		No I don't.

				CAMILLE
		Child, please.  Ever since you were
		little you thought you were too good for
		anything I had to say.

				MONICA
		I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail
		polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray
		of your perfume.

				CAMILLE
		What was so wrong with wanting to teach
		you the things I knew could help you?

				MONICA
		Because you're pushing me to be something
		I'm not.

				CAMILLE
		So you're angry with me because you're
		standing here with your hair combed and
		wearing perfume?

	Monica is busted.  It takes her a moment to come back.

				MONICA
		I'm angry because I want a mother, not
		Martha Stewart.

				CAMILLE
		Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete
		whose mother is nothing but a housewife.

				MONICA
		That's not it.

				CAMILLE
		Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that
		because I know.

	Monica stares at her mother.

				MONICA
		I remember when I was eight years old,
		you spent like four hours cooking up this
		fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do
		was set the table.  And I guess you and
		Dad got your wires crossed or something
		because he walks in with a couple of
		pizzas.  And you didn't say anything.
		You just threw the whole meal into some
		tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.

				CAMILLE
		I don't remember that.

				MONICA
		I do.  You never stood up for yourself.
		Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because
		of that.

				CAMILLE
		That's ridiculous.

				MONICA
		What's ridiculous is not being a caterer
		so your husband can feel like a man
		knowing his woman's home cooking and
		ironing his drawers.

	WHAP!  Camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off
	Monica with a SLAP.  Camille curses herself for losing it.

				CAMILLE
		Dammitt, Monica!

	Monica is stunned, hurt.

				MONICA
		I'm sorry.

	Camille stares at her daughter, devastated.

				CAMILLE
		Is that really all you think of me?

	Monica can't answer.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		When I married your father, all I wanted
		was a nice house with a big kitchen so I
		could start my catering business.  And
		then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I
		got pregnant with you.  And I put it out
		of my mind because that's what you did.

	Monica stares at her mother.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		But you want to know what day I remember?
		In high school, you getting ready for the
		Spring Dance.  I put my pearls around
		your neck, told you you were beautiful
		and you looked like you were going to
		cry.  That day I was happy I didn't have
		a catering business to run off to.  My
		family had three meals a day, had someone
		to pick up after them, and when my
		daughters went to a dance, I helped them
		get ready.  That's what I came to care
		about.

				MONICA
			(softly)
		That's all you cared about.  I must have
		played in a thousand games and I can only
		remember you being to two.

				CAMILLE
		You had your coaches and your father for
		that stuff.  It never mattered one way or
		the other if I went to your games.

				MONICA
		It mattered, Mom.

	Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in
	her eyes.  Monica moves off the barstool and leaves.
	
	
	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY



	The room looks exactly the same.  Trophies, medals, plaques.
	Basketball posters and her "strong women" wall.

	Monica sits on her bed, staring up at a photo of her and
	Quincy, tacked up to her bulletin board, amid other photos of
	her childhood.  THEY ARE EIGHTEEN, PLAYFULLY WRESTLING OVER A
	BASKETBALL.

	Monica slowly rises, starts taking her posters down.

	INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

	Quincy sits on a leg extension machine, with his left leg
	tucked under the padded bar.  A TRAINER stands behind him.

	Sweat and pain coat Quincy's face and scarred knee as he
	slowly lifts the light weight again, and again, and again.

	INT. BANK - DAY

	A long line of customers shift impatiently during the noon-
	time rush.

	Monica sits with a BANK MANAGER at the "New Accounts" desk,
	learning the ropes.  Her hair is done, she wears a simple
	dress.  Behind her, hanging on the wall, are three framed
	photos of the bank presidents.  ONE OF THEM IS HER FATHER,
	NATHAN.

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Monica stands in her room, staring out at Quincy's window.
	She watches as Quincy and Kyra pack up some of Quincy's
	stuff.  Quincy tries to take his basketball globe light. She
	laughs, "Hell no."

	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY

	Camille enters, moves to Monica's garbage can, dumps the
	contents into her larger bag.  Suddenly, she stops.  She
	reaches into the garbage and pulls out a crumpled picture.

	Camille smooths it.  It is the photo of Monica and Quincy at
	eighteen, wrestling over a basketball.

	CAMILLE STARES AT IT, TAKEN IN BY THE PURE JOY IN HER
	DAUGHTER'S FACE.  She sits down on Monica's bed, still
	staring.

	INT. FORUM - DAY

	In the empty gym, Quincy jogs up and down the court.  He is
	still tentative on his knee, but he keeps jogging.

	And then, slowly, the determination melts from his face.  His
	jog turns into a walk, and then he just...stops.

	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Quincy stands in the middle of his room, taking in his life.
	Old, worn basketball posters still line the walls.  Trophies
	and awards.  USC memorabilia.  His basketball globe light.

	He walks to his window, looks out at Monica's window.  Her
	room is dark.

								   DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING

	Quincy tilts his face up to the shower head and rinses the
	soap from his face.  He hears the bathroom door open.  He
	shuts off the water and opens the curtain.

	Kyra sits on the toilet, taking a pee.  Quincy slams the
	curtain closed.

				QUINCY
		Damn, girl.

				KYRA
		What?

				QUINCY
		I don't wanna see that.

				KYRA
		Get used to it, babe.

	She flushes.  Quincy steps out, grabs a towel.  A long scar
	runs across his knee cap.

				QUINCY
		Brother's gonna have to start locking
		doors.

	Kyra laughs as she buttons up her flight attendant's uniform.
	They cross into:

	INT. QUINCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Kyra packs up a suitcase.

				QUINCY
		So how long is this trip?

				KYRA
		Four days.

	Quincy nods.

				KYRA (cont'd)
		So are you going to be the kind of
		husband who won't let his wife work?

				QUINCY
		Nah.

				KYRA
			(playfully)
		Why not?

				QUINCY
		You might be the only one with a job.

				KYRA
		Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's
		going well.  You'll be back before you
		know it.

				QUINCY
		Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.
		Busting my ass, for what?

				KYRA
		To do what you love.

				QUINCY
		I don't know sometimes.

				KYRA
		You're just scared.  I know rehab is
		hard, and you have to worry about whether
		you'll be as good as you were but you
		will be.  I believe in you.  You just
		have to get back on the court.  Like
		you'd get back on a horse.

				QUINCY
			(beat)
		A horse?

				KYRA
		Don't make fun of me when I'm being
		wonderful and supportive.
			(then)
		You belong on the court.  Just like I
		belong in the stands, looking cute and
		cheering you on.

	She smiles, gives him a kiss, moves back to her packing.  Off
	Quincy:

	INT. BANK - DAY

	Monica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt, punching
	numbers into the computer.  A man sits down in the chair
	opposite her.  Monica glances up.  It's her father.

				NATHAN
		Hey, munchkin.

				MONICA
		Dad.  What are you doing here?

				NATHAN
		I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been
		hearing good things about you.

				MONICA
		That tends to happen when you're the
		boss's daughter.

				NATHAN
		So how's the job going?

	Monica forces a smile.

				MONICA
		You know.

	Nathan looks at her, nods.

				NATHAN
		I think I know what the problem is.

	He pulls a GARBAGE CAN HOOP from a plastic shopping bag.
	Monica smiles.  He attaches it to her garbage can.

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		There.

	He shoots an ugly, imaginary shot.  She laughs.

				MONICA
		You shoot like a girl.

				NATHAN
		I'll take that as a compliment.

	He gives her a smile, and exits.  Monica looks at the hoop,
	then crumples a piece of paper.

				MONICA
			(whispering)
		And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one-
		on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...

	Monica shoots.  The paper drops through the net.

				MONICA (cont'd)
			(still whispering)
		It's good!  It's good!

	She glances up, notices a few patrons watching her.  Monica
	quickly composes herself and goes back to her work.

	EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - DUSK

	Monica exits her car, after a long day at work.  She wears
	very low heels.  But she still stumbles.  She curses, then
	hears a laugh.

	She looks up - Quincy sits on the grassy hill above her
	house.

				QUINCY
		I remember when your mom had to beat you
		into a dress.

	Monica smiles.

				MONICA
		You visiting?

				QUINCY
			(nods)
		Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured
		I'd keep Mom company.

				MONICA
		Who's this guy I always see her around?

				QUINCY
		Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.

				MONICA
		So...how's the knee?

				QUINCY
		Getting there.

				MONICA
		Strong enough to get you down the aisle?

				QUINCY
		Yeah.  Two weeks.
			(then)
		I didn't get to send you an invitation,
		but if you...

				MONICA
		That's okay.  I'm probably, you know,
		busy.

	Quincy nods.  Awkward beat.

				QUINCY
		Can I ask you something?

	Monica looks at him.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		You never told me why ball isn't fun
		anymore.

				MONICA
		It just isn't.

				QUINCY
		Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.

				MONICA
		You had a rough couple years, that's all.

				QUINCY
		That a nice way of saying I rode the
		bench?

				MONICA
		And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is
		tough.

				QUINCY
		Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four
		and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of
		the attention, but besides that...

				MONICA
		You're serious.

				QUINCY
		Seems like I needed a ball when I was
		trying to be like my pops...or trying to
		be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I
		need to try something else.

				MONICA
		Like what?

				QUINCY
		Maybe go back to school.

				MONICA
		Wow.

	Monica stares at him, seeing a man in the boy she grew up
	with.  Quincy looks away, self-conscious.

				QUINCY
		I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school
		thing yet.
			(then)
		She'll probably say it's the painkillers
		talking.

				MONICA
		It's a trip, you know?  When you're a
		kid, you see the life you want, and it
		never crosses your mind that it's not
		gonna turn out that way.

				QUINCY
		So why'd you give up ball?

				MONICA
		Why do you keep asking me that?

				QUINCY
		Cause I don't get it.

				MONICA
		Something was just missing.

				QUINCY
		What?

	Monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.

				MONICA
		It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave
		it alone.

				QUINCY
		Find.

	Monica turns, crosses to her house.  She stumbles on her
	heels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside.
	Quincy walks back to his curb.

	ANGLE ON

	Camille watches from the kitchen window

								   DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - PATIO - DUSK

	Lena sits next to Camille.  Her one year old son, L.P., sits
	on the ground at her feet.  Monica sits quietly nearby,
	watching.

				CAMILLE
		So you're still breast-feeding?

				LENA
		The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm
		still trying to lose some of this baby
		fat.

	She quickly looks over at Monica.

				LENA (cont'd)
		Shut up.

	Monica gives her a small smile.  Camille looks down at L.P.

				CAMILLE
		You might want to put a jacket on him,
		it's getting cold.

				LENA
		He's fine.

				CAMILLE
			(warning)
		Okay.

	Lena sighs, rolls her eyes.  She picks up her son.

				LENA
		Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too
		cold.

	She exits inside.  Camille makes a face.

				CAMILLE
		God.  "Grandma."

	Monica smiles.  And then silence.  There is still so much
	distance between them, so many misunderstanding.  Camille
	stares at her daughter.  And then...

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		You know, I'd probably be a lot more
		"prissy" in the situation than you'd
		like, but the thing I always admired that
		drove me crazy, was the fight you had in
		you.

				MONICA
		What are you talking about?

				CAMILLE
		When I said Quincy could do better, I was
		thinking about you.

	Monica stares at her mom.  Camille stands and leaves.
	
	
	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT



	Monica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to

	sleep.  Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her

	choices, her future...



	Suddenly, she climbs out of bed.  She wears a tank-top and
	pajama bottoms.  She crosses to her window, pulls it open and
	climbs out.

	EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

	Monica drops down.  She moves to Quincy's window and knocks
	quietly.  Beat, then Quincy appears.  Bare-chested and in a
	pair of shorts.  He looks at her, then pulls open the window.

				QUINCY
			(half-asleep)
		What's going on?

				MONICA
		We need to talk.

	Quincy just looks at her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Please.

				QUINCY
		Hold on.

	Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T-
	shirt.  He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground.

	Quincy looks at her.

				MONICA
		You asked me what was missing.

				QUINCY
		What?

				MONICA
		From basketball.

				QUINCY
		you woke me up to tell me that?

				MONICA
		It's not fun for me anymore because
		you're missing.

	Quincy stares at her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		What I'm trying to say is --

				QUINCY
		I heard enough.

				MONICA
		What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you
		since I was eleven and the shit won't go
		away.

				QUINCY
		We haven't talked since college and now
		you wait two weeks before my wedding to
		say something like this?

				MONICA
		I know, I probably should have said it
		two weeks ago.

	Quincy doesn't even crack a smile.  In fact, he glares.

				QUINCY
		You haven't changed.  You still think the
		sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well,
		guess what, it doesn't.

				MONICA
		Then why are you so upset?

				QUINCY
		Because you don't pull this on someone
		who's about to get married.

				MONICA
		Better late than never, right?

				QUINCY
		Wrong.

	Quincy starts back toward the window.

				MONICA
		I'll play you.

				QUINCY
		What?

				MONICA
		One game.  One-on-one.

				QUINCY
		For what?

				MONICA
		Your heart.

	Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the
	absurdity.

				QUINCY
		You're out of your mind.

				MONICA
		So you're gonna bitch up?

				QUINCY
		What's that supposed to be, psychology?

				MONICA
		I know why you broke up with me in
		college.  And not that what you did
		wasn't messed up, but what I did was,
		too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive
		you.

				QUINCY
		Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I
		couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I
		was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that
		was five years ago.  I moved on.

	Monica moves past him, reaches through his window.  She drops
	back down, holding his basketball.

				MONICA
		Prove it.

	She throws him the ball.

				QUINCY
		What will this prove?

				MONICA
		You once said the reason I beat you was
		because you wanted me to.

				QUINCY
		So?

				MONICA
		So, if I win it's because deep down you
		know you're about to make the biggest
		mistake of your life, and deep down your
		want me to stop you.

				QUINCY
		And what happens when you lose?

				MONICA
		If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding
		present.

	Quincy stares at her.
	
	  EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SHORT TIME LATER



	Monica stands opposite Quincy.  Both are suited up in

	basketball gear.



	They stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses
	him the ball.

				MONICA
		Check.

	Quincy tosses the ball back.  Monica drives.  Quincy's knee
	is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up.  She scores
	easily.

	She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		One, zip.  Check.

	Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back.

	The game continues.  Monica owns the first five points easily
	by exploiting Quincy's injury.

	Monica drives for another lay-up.  Quincy suddenly lets go of
	his fear, leaps and swats her shot.

	He grabs the rebound and lays it up.  He nods intensely, as
	he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key.

				QUINCY
		One, five.  Check.

	The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using
	his size and strength.  He scores seven straight points.

	The score stays close.  It is a sexually-charged battle of
	wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.  Their
	bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.  Monica yanks
	off her jersey in frustration.  Her ass bumps into his hips
	as she backs him in.  Her hands slide across his chest as she
	guards him...

	Finally, the score hits nine, nine.  Monica slowly walks to
	the top of the key.

				MONICA
		Nine, up.  Point.

	She tosses Quincy the ball.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Check.

	Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.  Monica
	fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.  Monica drives around
	him.  SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.  SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT
	ROLLS OFF THE RIM.  Monica can't believe it.

	Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.  He stares at
	Monica as he dribbles in front of her.  She stares back.

	He breaks for the basket.  Monica stays with him.  He goes
	up.  Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot.
	Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.  He lets go
	of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.  GAME OVER.

	Silence.  Quincy stares at her.  Monica looks back.  Then:

				QUINCY
			(pointed)
		All's fair in love and basketball, right?

	Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up.
	She slowly walks back toward her house.  And then:

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hey.

	Monica slowly stops, turns.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Double or nothing.

	Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy
	limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.

	Monica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other.
	No more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love.

	In the moonlight, on the blacktop, they kiss...

								FADE TO BLACK.
								
	  FADE IN:



	INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT



	Music is blasting, banners are waving, crowd is screaming.



	Magic Johnson sits in a floor seat, watching the game.  A

	REPORTER interviews him.

				SPORTS REPORTER
		So, Magic, are you contemplating another
		comeback?

				MAGIC
			(laughs)
		No more comebacks.  Tonight I'm just
		enjoying being a spectator.

	Behind him, in a second row seat, a ONE YEAR BLACK GIRL sits
	in a lap, bouncing, watching feet and legs ballin' on the
	court.

	Quincy leans down, gives the little girl a kiss, then looks
	out at the court.  It's the Los Angeles Sparks and the New
	York Liberty.  The WNBA.

	On the court, the women line up for a free-throw.

				QUINCY
		Let's go, McCall!

	Monica, sporting a uniform with Wright-McCall on the back and
	the number thirty-two, looks over.  Quincy takes their
	daughter's hand and waves it.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Go Mommy.

	Monica smiles back, then steps to the line.  The referee
	tosses her the ball.  Monica stares at the basket, then
	bounces the ball twice, licks her lips and shoots.

								 FADE TO BLACK.

                           "... the magic is all around you.
                                  All the time.  Everywhere.
                                             In every thing.
                                 The trick... is to see it."



IN BLACK...

... the insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat of
BOOGIE-WOOGIE.  Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up.

THEN...

... in the blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumbling
g-e-n-t-l-y, a picture-postcard:

                "GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!"

Then another... and another, each one dropping through frame,
a gentle rain.

In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie
stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and-
footprints in the wet cement.

Another postcard:

        "I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!"

In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and
Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at
the Brown Derby.  Or Ciro's.  Or the Coconut Grove...

More postcards.  Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones
that you and I know today.  These are palaces.  Temples. 
Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian.  The Carthay Circle.  The
Paramount, the Million Dollar.  From a time when moviegoing
was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall.  The
ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded
jackets and guided you to your seat.  The popcorn was hot and
fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil.

                                                  CUT TO:

THE PILE OF POSTCARDS

a wild jumble.  Then, one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on top
of the pile.  It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet of
lights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt. Lee's most
famous resident, the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN.  We PUSH INTO
THE PICTURE OF THE SIGN, DISSOLVING UNTIL WE'RE...

... PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer and closer,
until we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up and
behind it until we're looking down at...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT

SUPER TITLE: 1951

A gigantic aerial shot.  Postwar autos fill the muggy
midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING
HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.  Darkened
outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home
construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being
built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town,
a swath of garishly bright concrete called

HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Of course, it's not like the
          postcards say it is.  This is what
          it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and
          this is my town.

Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the
intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the
boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and
Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian
Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across
Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the
street to

GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Born and raised here, thank you
          very much.  Sometimes, it seems
          like everyone here is from
          somewhere else.  But everyone loves
          the movies, so Hollywood is
          everyone's town, and they come here
          by the busload.  To them, Grauman's
          Chinese Theater is just about the
          most exciting place on the planet. 
          To me, it's the theater that's
          playing "The African Queen."

And like the man said, the film on the marquee is "THE
AFRICAN QUEEN."  Still the same shot, buses disgorge
TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.  The
MEN doff their hats and mop their brows.  The WOMEN pull
their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with
movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. 
We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay
behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on
their way to

THE THEATER ENTRANCE,

where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their
tickets.

                    DOORMAN
          Newsreel's just starting, folks.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          That's me and my girlfriend.  Her
          name is Sandra Sinclair, and this
          is her town, too -- she's from
          Cleveland.  She came out here to be
          an actress, and that's just what
          she's doing.  The first picture I
          ever wrote, a little potboiler
          called "Sand Pirates of the
          Sahara."  Okay, it ain't "Citizen
          Kane," but you gotta start
          somewhere.

MOVING INTO THE LOBBY

an explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. 
Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting
and golden light.  We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the
same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the
auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect
USHERS and we move into

THE DARKENED THEATER.

As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the
soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the
unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the
same shot -- we see the screen...

A NEWSREEL.

As the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL
ANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE:

                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
          Bringing the news of the world to
          you!

Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee
Hearing Room, a title blares "HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!"

                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
          Four years ago, in one of
          filmland's darkest hours, ten men,
          the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were
          called to testify before the House
          Committee of Un-American
          Activities, investigating the
          proliferation of the dreaded Red
          Menace in Hollywood.

We see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal
battles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. 
JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE.

                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
          Refusing to answer the lawmaker's
          questions, cowering behind the
          Fifth Amendment's protection
          against self-incrimination, the ten
          motion picture writers dared
          Congress to come after them.  Well,
          come after them they did!  And
          after years of court wrangling,
          it's now time to pay the piper!

Over shots of several of the "Hollywood Ten" being led to
jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues.

                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
          And so, it's off to jail, the
          charge: Contempt of Congress!  This
          should give you fellas something to
          write about now!  A new round of
          investigations begins this fall,
          the mandate: Get the reds out of
          Hollywood!

In the audience, one man YELLS "Lock up the commie
bastards!," and a few others cheer and laugh.  As the
newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we
WHEEL AROUND AND...

ENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR.

Pete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and Sandra's a starlet
pretty girl in her mid-20s.  As she rummages in her purse,
Pete watches the newsreel.

                    SANDRA
          Pete, there's time before the
          picture starts, you want to get
          some popcorn?

                    PETE
          You bet, honey.

Pete kisses Sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints up
the aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin on
his face.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          We were young, we were in love, and
          we were working in pictures. 
          Life... was good.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - MAIN GATE - MORNING

Pete pulls up to the guard kiosk in his spiffy yellow
convertible Plymouth.  The Guard, RAY, steps out to meet him. 
Pete lights up a cigarette.  We get a better sense of him
now.  Though earnest, he's jocular, and a bit of a fast
talker.

                    PETE
              (very chipper)
          Mornin', Ray.  Whaddya know whaddya
          say?  Me and Sandra caught "The
          African Queen" at the Chinese last
          night.  Great picture, great
          picture.

Ray is nonplussed.  Tips his hat.  Regards Pete suspiciously.

                    RAY
          Mr. Appleton.

                    PETE
          What's with this "Mr. Appleton"
          crap?  Your boss hiding in there?

                    RAY
          You're clear to go in.

                    PETE
          What's that mean?

Ray heads back to his kiosk, shaking his head.

                    RAY
          Have a pleasant day.

Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.

EXT.  UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - WRITER'S BUILDING - MORNING

Pete pulls up, hops out, grinds out his cigarette, looks
around and goes inside.

INT.  WRITER'S BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNING

Pete comes down the hall a few steps, stops.  Something's
wrong.  It's awfully quiet.  He pokes his head into the door
marked "TYPING POOL."

INT.  TYPING POOL - MORNING

A sea of black Underwoods -- all silent.  The lights in the
room are off, and hard shafts of morning sun stream in
through the windows.  One typists, LOUISE, is going from
machine to machine, pulling covers over them.

                    PETE
          Louise... what gives?

She looks up, startled.

                    LOUISE
          Oh Pete... they, uh, they gave
          everybody the day off... while they
          sort things out.

                    PETE
          Sort what out?  Are my pages done?

                    LOUISE
          They took 'em.

                    PETE
          They took 'em?  Who took 'em? 
          Louise, what's going on...

                    LOUISE
          Pete, I'm not even supposed to be
          talking to you...

She rushes past him.  Pete doesn't quite know what to think.

                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Good morning, Peter.

Pete turns.  The voice belongs to Pete's agent, LEO KUBELSKY,
a rotund man in his fifties.  He wears a perfectly tailored
silk suit.

                    PETE
          Leo... what's going on?

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STUDIO STREET - DAY

FROM FAR AWAY, we watch as Leo and Pete come out of the
Writer's Building and join a flood of DRESS EXTRAS, all done
up in Puritan pilgrim garb and heading for the commissary.

As they move through the mob and emerge on the other side,
it's clear that Pete is reeling from something he's just been
told.

PETE AND LEO

                    LEO
          Peter, their hands are tied.  You
          see that, don't you?

                    PETE
          I... I don't believe this.

                    LEO
          Are you saying it's a mistake, that
          you didn't go to any meetings? 
          They say you did.

                    PETE
          Who the hell is this "they?"

                    LEO
          Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it
          don't matter who the hell "they"
          is.  "They" know who "they" are,
          that's all that matters.
              (deliberately)
          Now, did you go to any meetings?

                    PETE
              (on the spot)
          No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. 
          Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before
          Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. 
          It was a bunch of kids, and I was
          just one of 'em.  I didn't believe
          in what they were saying.  Hell, I
          didn't even know what they were
          saying!

                    LEO
          So, you're saying that it's true. 
          You went to a meeting of a known
          communist organization.

                    PETE
          Leo, I was trying to impress a
          skirt.  You know me, I'm non-
          political.  Republican, Democrat,
          Communist, there's not a dime's
          worth of difference between 'em
          anyway.

                    LEO
          You should watch what you say.

                    PETE
          I don't know who fingered me, but
          I'm not a communist!

                    LEO
          Kid, that cuts no ice with them.

                    PETE
              (frustrated)
          What?  That I'm accused of being a
          communist when I don't happen to be
          one?

                    LEO
          They know you were at that meeting,
          Peter.  They've been told, and they
          know.

                    PETE
          Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them"
          to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do
          anything wrong.  I fought in the
          war, for crissakes!

                    LEO
          Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the
          PX at Fort Dix.

                    PETE
          I was decorated.

                    LEO
          I know.  A Purple Heart.

                    PETE
          Exactly.

                    LEO
          You broke your arm.  You were
          coming out of a bar.  You were
          drunk.

                    PETE
          At least I was on our side!  Look,
          they want me to testify?  I'll
          testify.  I'll tell 'em anything
          they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo,
          this is my career!

                    LEO
          You can't testify.

                    PETE
          Why not?

Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket,
offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself.

                    LEO
          Don't take this personally, kid. 
          If it were up to me, I'd have you
          testify wearing your uniform and
          your medal, wrapped in a flag with
          one hand on your heart and the
          other hand on a bible.  What can I
          say?  I like you.

Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own.  Puts a fatherly
hand on his shoulder.

                    LEO
          They don't want you to testify
          because you're not a big enough
          fish for them.  They just don't
          want you writing pictures for now. 
          That's all.

                    PETE
              (under his breath)
          Yeah, well, that's enough.

                    LEO
          Peter, I believe in you.  More to
          the point, I read your new
          script... um...

                    PETE
          "Ashes To Ashes?"

                    LEO
          That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." 
          I think it's great.  But it'll
          never get made with this communist
          business hanging over your head. 
          You can't work until you're cleared
          -- and believe me, starting right
          now, I'm gonna do everything I can
          to make that happen.

                    PETE
          So, it is a blacklist.

                    LEO
              (defensive)
          Don't say that.  There is no such
          thing as a blacklist.
              (calm)
          Now, are you gonna play ball?

                    PETE
              (sullenly)
          Yes.
              (then, pissed)
          Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!

Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke.

                    LEO
              (hand on Pete's shoulder)
          Kid, this is the United States
          Government we're talkin' about. 
          Fair ain't the point.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAY

Prominent on the wall is a framed "SAND PIRATES OF THE
SAHARA" poster.  Pete reaches up and takes it down.  He leans
it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden
swivel chair.  He swivels around to see

A STUDIO SECURITY GUARD

standing by the door.  He's watching Pete's every move.

Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's
belongings.  Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk
drawer.  He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the
desk.  He looks at the cover of the first one:

                "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"
                     By Peter Appleton
                A United Pictures Production
                     February 19, 1951

Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the
second one:

                      "ASHES TO ASHES"
                     By Peter Appleton

He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box,
which contains somewhat more personal items.  A ragged gold
pillow with tassels.  Legal pads of notes.  An old tin-toy
fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn.  He turns
it around in his hands.

                    PETE
              (musing)
          Huh.  Red...

Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door.

                    SANDRA (O.S.)
          Pete?  Pete...?

Sandra appears in the doorway.  She's in costume -- a Louis
XIV courtier.  She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and
embraces him.

                    SANDRA
          Oh, Pete...

They kiss.  The Guard watches their every move.

                    SANDRA
          What happened?

                    PETE
          What exactly did you hear?

                    SANDRA
          That you got let go.

                    PETE
          I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie
          Ruskin directing the picture you're
          in?

                    SANDRA
          He was, but he got sick.  We got a
          new director today.  Why?

                    PETE
          Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's
          catching.

                    SANDRA
          You mean, he was... let go, too?

                    PETE
              (sotto, an appeal)
          They're saying I'm a communist,
          Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. 
          I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna
          win, but I'll need your help.

During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling
away from Pete.

                    PETE
          A lot of good people are being
          accused of things they didn't do. 
          Hell, even if I was a communist,
          this is America, goddammit, a
          person should be able to be
          whatever they want to be!  Right?

Sandra glances at the Guard, who is watching everything.

                    SANDRA
              (nervously)
          Of course, but I... I don't know
          how I... how much help I can be to
          you.  This is the sort of thing...
          someone saying you're a
          communist... it can ruin your
          career.

Pete sees where this is going.  She's edging toward the door.

                    PETE
          Will you help me, Sandy?

                    SANDRA
          I'll have to think about this.  I
          have to get back... I should go...

And she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye.  Pete
looks at the Guard.

                    PETE
          So nice to be a pariah.

The Guard turns away.  Pete moves back toward the boxes. 
Rummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels
with barely one swig left.  He regards the bottle for a
moment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't),
pops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it.  He looks
at it thoughtfully as we

                                                  CUT TO:

A HALF-FULL BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS setting down on a bartop.

WIDER

INT.  THE FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT

The bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietly
getting stewed.  The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive,
dimly lit and full of character and characters.  It's a quiet
night and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are just
leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s. 
Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of
the bar.  Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. 
Good boy, he got most of it in the glass.

                    JERRY
          Pete.  You think maybe you've had
          enough?

                    PETE
          Bought the bottle, didn't I?
              (raises the shot)
          To the United States of America. 
          Long my she wave.

He knocks it back and Jerry pours him another.

                    PETE
              (trying to light a smoke)
          Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.

                    JERRY
          What.

                    PETE
          You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

                    JERRY
              (helps Pete light his
               cigarette)
          The G-man?

                    PETE
              (thickly)
          Zackly.

                    JERRY
          Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in
          here wearing a dress, I wouldn't
          know him.

                    PETE
          Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.

                    JERRY
              (glancing around)
          You should watch what you say.  You
          don't know who's listening.

                    PETE
          You know I'm not a communist, don't
          you, Jer?

                    JERRY
          Sure, I suppose.  That why you're
          on a bender?

                    PETE
          This is not a bender yet.  This is
          the start of a bender.  But I can
          see how you were confused, they
          look a lot alike.

Pete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar.  He
watches Jerry, who is not about to refill it.  Pete reaches
for the bottle, but Jerry is faster.  

                    JERRY
          Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll
          call that girlfriend of yours,
          what's her name... Sandy?

                    PETE
              (laughs)
          Sandra Sinclair.

                    JERRY
          Gimmee her number, I'll have her
          pick you up.

                    PETE
          Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her
          real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No
          one's who they really are, Jer. 
          Everyone's someone else.  Even you. 
          Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter
          Appleton, the communist who's not
          really a communist.

                    JERRY
          I wanna close up soon.  C'mon,
          let's call her.

Peter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled bills
on the bar and grabs his hat.

                    PETE
          Nope.  Can't.  We're through.

                    JERRY
          Then I'll call you a cab.

                    PETE
          I'll save you the trouble.
              (beat)
          I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.

Pete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his
car keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in his
condition.

                    PETE
          'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll
          be seein' ya, Jer.

                    JERRY
          Pete...

And he's out the door.

EXT.  FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT

Pete takes a few steps, stumbles, stops, takes a deep breath,
then totters briskly towards his car.  He hauls the door open
and sits inside heavily.

INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR - NIGHT

Sitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as
though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably
be a good idea.

                    PETE
              (mumbling)
          Drive.  Drive.  Bad idea.  Too
          drunk to drive.

He looks at his watch.

                    PETE
          One-thirty.  Huh!  Early.  Can't go
          home yet.

He turns the key and hits the starter.  The engine hums to
life.  Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze
and puts the car in gear.

The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt
and stalls.

                    PETE
          Oops.

He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and
down the deserted boulevard.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT

The full moon is low over the ocean.  Pete's car is parked at
the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away.  The ferris
wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark
and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight.  Pete is asleep
in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his
face, snoring.

The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake.

                    PETE
          Huh?  Whatsa...

Instantly, he grabs his head.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          I had no idea how I got to Santa
          Monica, but it certainly was a good
          idea.  I don't think I could've
          faced the headache I had alone in
          my apartment.  At least I had the
          ocean air.

Pete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing.  He gets out
his cigarettes and lights up.  He takes a puff and glances at
his watch.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Three forty-five.  I had only been
          there for a couple of hours at
          most.  Truth be told, I was still
          fairly drunk.

He starts the car and heads for the highway.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          I'd head north until the sun came
          up or I ran out of gas, whichever
          came first.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Pete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop.  Waves crash
to the shore below the roadway.

INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Pete is finally relaxed.  He takes off his hat and jams it
down in the back seat.  He takes a deep breath -- with the
wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at
peace.  He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the
fuel gauge.

INSERT - FUEL GAUGE

Pinning on "empty."

                    PETE
          Shit.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Guess which came first.

He scans the road ahead -- nothing.  Glances to his right.

PETE'S POV

The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance.

Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that
will take him toward the lights.  He passes a hand-painted
sign that gives him hope: "GAS - 1 MI."

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  RORY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT

Pete's car rolls up and stops.  There's a light on the sign
and another in the station's window, but the place is
deserted.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          I should've known better than to
          think that a service station in the
          sticks would be open at this hour,
          but it wasn't like I had a lot of
          choices.

Pete looks ahead toward the town.  Its few lights twinkle in
the distance.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          What the hell.  At least there'd be
          a diner opening in a couple of
          hours.  I'd get some pie and
          coffee, and then I could worry
          about the gas.

Pete pulls out onto the road.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT

Pete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted
roadside sign which reads:

                           SLOW!
         NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL
                        USE CAUTION!

INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Pete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading
"LAWSON WASH," just in front of a small wooden auto bridge.

Barely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge...

HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

... his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless
possum...

Pete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the
edge...

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

... and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and
into the rapidly-moving water below!

EXT.  UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The water is flowing very quickly, and the current is
intense.  Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat
(thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the
windshield.

But... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle.  Nearly
out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and
heads for the surface.

EXT.  THE WASH - NIGHT

Pete breaks the surface and gasps for air.  His fight isn't
over yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream. 
He swims with all his might toward the far bank.

EXT.  FAR BANK OF THE WASH - NIGHT

Drained, Pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to
his feet.

                    PETE
              (gasping)
          Oh my god!  I don't believe... oh
          my god...

He stumbles along backwards a couple of steps... and his heel
hits a rock...

Pete falls backward -- and his head strikes a glancing blow
on another rock.  He rolls down the bank, unconscious, and
lands face down in the mud.

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

IN BLACK, we slowly become aware of a panting, breathing
sound -- the sound of a dog...

FADE IN:

ON A DOG'S FACE

A yellow labrador, full frame.  It takes a couple more
sniffs, then starts licking furiously.

                    OLD MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Maggie, whatcha got there?  Huh,
          girl?  Whatcha find?

EXT.  FAR BANK OF THE WASH - DAWN

Pete is still laying face down on the bank, being fervently
licked in the face by the dog.

ON THE OLD MAN

A no-nonsense sort in his late-60s, he wears overalls and an
old railroad cap.  He comes down to Pete, and using his
walking stick, pokes him in the side.

                    OLD MAN
          Mister, who are ya?  my dog likes
          you, but that don't mean much, she
          likes skunks, too.  Sweet n'stupid,
          that's why I keep her.

Pete blinks up at the Old Man, his mouth gaping open.

                    OLD MAN
          Mister, you okay?  You look wet. 
          You in an accident or somethin'?

                    PETE
          I... I don't know.

He sits up, and the Old Man gets a look at his head, which is
caked with mud and blood on one side.

                    OLD MAN
          You best come with me.  Can ya
          walk?

                    PETE
          I... yes, I think so.

He stands up shakily.  The Old Man gives Pete a hand.

                    OLD MAN
          Come on, we'll have the Doc look
          you over.

                    PETE
          My head hurts.

                    OLD MAN
          I shouldn't be surprises.  You
          smell like that was quite a night
          before you had there.
              (to the dog)
          Maggie!  Let's go now!

And they head toward the road to town.  BOOMING UP, we SEE
them pass a roadside sign:

ON THE SIGN:

                         WELCOME TO
                     LAWSON, CALIFORNIA
                         EST. 1869
                   ELEV. 275    POP. 1755
                          THE TOWN
                     THAT GAVE ITS ALL

                    OLD MAN (STANTON)
          Name's Stanton Lawson.  My
          ancestors founded this town.

                    PETE
          Ancestors?

                    STANTON
          Actually, my grandpap.  But
          "ancestors" sounds better, don't
          it?
              (hands Pete a
               handkerchief)
          Here.

Pete takes the handkerchief and wipes the mud and some of the
blood off his face.

                    PETE
          I suppose.  Thanks.

                    STANTON
          You look familiar, fella.  What's
          your name?

Pete stops, thinks for a moment.

                    PETE
          I'm... I... I honestly don't know.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - LAWSON, CALIFORNIA - DAY

Pete and Stanton walk along Commerce Street, the main drag
through the center of the small town.  Lawson is a bit run
down, creeping inexorably toward decrepit.  Despite that,
there's a timeless quality to the small buildings, a familiar
All-American feel.

Several of the PEOPLE walking along the street take notice of
Pete and nod to Stanton, who nods back.

                    PETE
          They all know you?

                    STANTON
          'Course they all know me.  And I
          know all them.  Town's got my name,
          don't it?

They pass the window of the drug store, COLE'S PHARMACY. 
Pete looks down and sees

TWO FADED GOLD STARS

in the window with two faded photos, all decked in tattered
black crepe.  Two boys, no more than 18 and 19, who went off
to war and didn't come back.

Stanton notes Pete stopping to look at the stars and photos.

                    STANTON
          Ernie Cole here just got himself
          elected mayor.  Lost both his boys
          in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and
          Willie at Normandy.

                    PETE
              (thinking)
          The war...

                    STANTON
              (points across the street)
          Mabel over there at the diner lost
          her husband Max.  Okinawa, I
          believe.

ANGLE - MABEL'S DINER

A typical small-town greasy spoon -- with one faded star
prominent in the window.

CLOSER

On MABEL LANIER, a sweet-faced woman in her 30s.  She stares
vacantly into space, her reverie broken by a customer needing
a coffee refill.

                    STANTON
          All told, this little town gave
          sixty-two of its finest to the war. 
          Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone. 
          More'n its share, I should say. 
          Got us a letter from President
          Truman.  City council commissioned
          a war memorial.  Been sittin' in
          the basement of city hall these six
          years.  Town never had the heart to
          put it up.  Place just hasn't been
          the same since the war.

STANTON AND PETE

Pete looks longingly toward the diner.  Stanton takes note.

                    STANTON
          You hungry, son?

                    PETE
          Yes.  Very.

                    STANTON
          Got any money?

Pete rummages in his pants pockets, and comes up with three
quarters.

                    STANTON
          Six bits.  More'n enough to buy
          some breakfast.  C'mon.

And they head across the street.

                                                  CUT TO:

A PLATE WITH TWO PIECES OF APPLE PIE

A fork comes into frame and tears into one of the slices.

WIDER

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Pete is fairly shoveling the pie into his mouth, pausing only
to wash it down with gulps of coffee.

MABEL

stands nearby, watching in amazement as her pie is consumed
in record time.

Pete notices that Stanton and Mabel -- and the other PATRONS,
for that matter -- are watching his feeding frenzy.  He stops
in his tracks, and starts chewing leisurely.  He smiles at
Mabel.

                    PETE
              (mouth full)
          Pie's... good.

                    MABEL
              (wryly)
          Like you could tell.
              (to Stanton)
          Where'd you find him?

                    STANTON
          Down by the wash.

                    MABEL
          We gotta put a rail on that thing
          before someone else gets killed.
              (to Pete)
          Three people have died there,
          Mister.  You're lucky to be alive.

                    PETE
              (draining the coffee cup)
          Thanks.  More coffee?

Mabel obliges.  As she pours the coffee, she looks at Pete.

                    MABEL
          You know, you look familiar.  You
          ever been in here before?

Pete shakes his head.

                    STANTON
          He don't remember who he is, Mabel. 
          Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon
          as he gets in.

                    MABEL
              (distractedly)
          Doc should be in for his coffee and
          bear claw any minute...
              (to Pete)
          You sure you never been in here?

Pete looks up at Mabel and smiles winningly.

                    PETE
          I'd remember this pie.

Mabel, thoroughly charmed, smiles back at Pete.

                    MABEL
              (patting his hand)
          I'll just get you another piece.

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - DAY

A stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, HARRY TRUMBO
shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner.  There's
a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man
who has little to smile about because he has little to care
about.  After a couple of steps, he's met up by DOC BEN
LARDNER, a vigorous man in his 50s.  He comes up behind Harry
and claps him on the back.

                    LARDNER
          'Mornin' Harry.  Fine day, isn't
          it?

                    HARRY
          Morning, Doc.  Yes, yes it looks
          just fine.

                    LARDNER
          Plenty to do today?

                    HARRY
              (vaguely)
          Oh, yes, plenty.  Plenty.

They're at the door of the diner.  Doc opens it for Harry.

                    LARDNER
          After you.

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Lardner comes over to Mabel, who hands him a tall paper cup
of coffee and bags him a bear claw.

                    LARDNER
          Mornin' Mabel, Stan.

                    MABEL
          Mornin' Doc.  Got some new business
          for you today.

Lardner and Pete make eye contact, and the doctor notices the
bump on his head.

                    LARDNER
          Hello, son.  How'd that happen?

                    STANTON
          He don't know.  And he don't know
          his name, neither.  Found him down
          by the wash.

                    LARDNER
          You'd better come with me, son.
              (to Mabel, indicating the
               coffee and danish)
          On my tab?

                    MABEL
          You bet.

Lardner, Stanton and Pete rise and move to the door.  Pete
turns back, takes the three quarters out of his pocket, and
puts them on the counter, smiling brightly at Mabel.

                    PETE
          Thanks.  Great pie.

                    MABEL
              (blushing)
          You're welcome.  Come again.

ON HARRY

seated at the opposite end of the counter.  He glances up at
Pete.

His mouth falls open, his hand moves to cover it.  He's just
seen a ghost...

          eyes.  That's it.  Good.

WIDER

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Doc Lardner is checking Pete's eyes.  Pete sits on an
examination table, his shirt off, his head freshly bandaged. 
Stanton lurks in the corner, Maggie curled at his feet.

                    STANTON
          He was passed out cold.  Maggie
          woke 'im.

                    LARDNER
          Uh-huh.  He looks familiar.
              (to Pete)
          Open your mouth.  Say "ah."

Pete does.  Lardner has a look as Stanton pulls out a pocket
watch.

                    STANTON
          Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't
          place him, though.  To look at him,
          you'd think the cheese slid off his
          cracker.
              (looks at his watch)
          Well, morning's half-over.  I'm
          off.

                    PETE
          Thank you, Mr. Lawson.

                    STANTON
          Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.

Stanton and Maggie exit.  Lardner checks Pete's ears.

                    LARDNER
          Any idea how you got here, son?

                    PETE
          No, sir.

Lardner sniffs him.

                    LARDNER
          Been drinkin' a bit, have we?

                    PETE
          I don't remember.  I guess so. 
          Smells like it.
              (smacks his lips and
               frowns)
          Tastes like it.

                    LARDNER
          Well, you've been wet to the skin. 
          You must've fallen in.

                    PETE
          I guess I did.

                    LARDNER
          Lucky you got out, that water's got
          quite a pull, and it empties
          straight into the ocean.

Lardner takes a shirt off his counter and hands it to Pete.

                    LARDNER
          Here, one of mine.

                    PETE
          Thanks.

Pete puts on the shirt.

                    LARDNER
          Do you remember if you were driving
          a car?  Maybe you went over the
          bridge.  No guard rail there, it's
          easy to do.  It's happened before.

                    PETE
          It's possible.  I just don't
          remember.

                    LARDNER
          And you don't know your name or who
          you are, that right?

                    PETE
              (frustrated)
          I... no, I... I just can't...

                    LARDNER
              (gently)
          It's okay, son.  We just need to
          call you something.  That's all.

Pete stifles a laugh.

                    LARDNER
          What is it?

                    PETE
          Call me... Ishmael?

                    LARDNER
          Well, at least you remember "Moby
          Dick."

Lardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling his
bear claw.  Pete is standing, nosing around the office --
diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks.  He zeros in on one
photo in particular.

ON THE PHOTO

one of Lardner and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.  They've been
fishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catch
than Lardner.

                    LARDNER
              (into phone)
          Stanton found him by the wash.  Not
          hurt too bad, but he took a nasty
          bump on the head and he can't
          remember who he is.  We both think
          he looks familiar, but we can't
          place him.  You bet.  He'll be
          here.

Lardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures.

                    LARDNER
          That's me and my daughter Adele. 
          My pride and joy.  Charms the fish
          right out of the lake, she does.

                    PETE
          She's very pretty.

                    LARDNER
          Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way
          over, and maybe we can get to the
          bottom of who you are...

Lardner stares at him.  Pete takes note, turns toward him.

                    LARDNER
          ... sorry 'bout that, but you do
          look familiar to me.

                    PETE
          Wish I could say the same thing.

The Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and SHERIFF CECIL
ELDRIDGE, 45, gets out.  As he gets a few steps from the

          Listen to me!  The young man in
          there...

Eldridge keeps moving to the door.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (interrupting)
          Stan Lawson found him unconscious
          by the wash this morning, and I'm
          here to investigate, and if we find
          anything interesting, it'll be in
          the paper, so why don't you just...

Harry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by the
shoulders.

                    HARRY
          Cecil, listen to me!

The sheriff stops.

                    HARRY
              (breathless)
          It's Luke.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

Sheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete.  He's staring at
him intently.  Silence.

                    ELDRIDGE
          No wallet, huh?

                    LARDNER
          No identification at all.
              (beat)
          What're you thinkin', Cecil?

                    ELDRIDGE
          What I'm thinkin' is we got us one
          a'two things here.  A mystery or a
          damn miracle.  And by god I can't
          tell which.
              (to Pete)
          Boy, you say you have no idea who
          you are?  That right?

                    PETE
          Yes.

                    ELDRIDGE
          You ever been in this town before,
          to your knowledge?

                    PETE
          No.  But...

                    ELDRIDGE
          But what?

                    PETE
          Well, this place sorta reminds me
          of something.

                    ELDRIDGE
          What's that?

                    PETE
          "It's a Wonderful Life."

                    ELDRIDGE
          The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I
          remember that one.  Saw it over at
          the Bijou.  So, you remember that,
          huh?

                    PETE
          "It's a Wonderful Life?"

                    ELDRIDGE
          Or the Bijou.  Either one.

                    PETE
          I remember the picture... but I
          don't remember where I saw it.

The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Doc, with your permission, I want
          to bring someone in here.  Maybe
          it'll jar this young man's memory.

                    LARDNER
          By all means.

Eldridge opens the door.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (to someone offscreen)
          Harry, why don't you come on in
          here.

Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head
of snow-white hair.  He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and
slowly turns to face Pete.  He looks closer... and closer. 
Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who
slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. 
Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe.

PETE

looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face...

HARRY

has tears forming in his eyes.  A smile turns up the corners
of his mouth, and quickly lights up his whole face.

                    LARDNER
              (softly, to Eldridge)
          Are you saying that he's...

                    ELDRIDGE
              (smiling broadly)
          Shhhhhh.

Harry takes Pete in his arms and hugs him tightly, burying
his face in Pete's shoulder and sobbing.

                    HARRY
          I knew all along.  I knew you were
          alive!  Oh, Luke...

Pete doesn't quite know what to think.  He clearly has no
idea who this old man is.

                    LARDNER
              (mouth agape in disbelief)
          Mother o'god...

                    ELDRIDGE
              (to Pete)
          Give the man a hug, boy!  That's
          your father!

Pete looks at Harry.  It's not so much that he remembers
anything -- he's swept up in the moment.

                    PETE
          My father...?

Pete wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tightly,
glancing over at

ELDRIDGE AND LARDNER

who look on goofily, fighting back tears.  They smile at
Pete, who smiles back tentatively.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

Harry, Pete, Eldridge and Lardner come outside.

                    ELDRIDGE
          C'mon, I'll give you two a lift
          back to the Bijou.

                    PETE
          The Bijou?

                    LARDNER
          That's where you live.

                    PETE
          We live in a theater?

                    HARRY
          Only one in town.
              (he opens the car door for
               Pete)
          Get in, son.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (sotto, to Lardner)
          Ben, when's Delly due back?

                    LARDNER
              (sotto)
          Tomorrow afternoon...
              (seized by a thought)
          ... oh my god...

                    ELDRIDGE
              (sotto)
          Exactly.  Break it to her gently.

Eldridge and Harry get in the car.  Lardner comes over to
Pete's back seat window.

                    LARDNER
          Get plenty of rest, Luke.  You took
          a pretty big wallop there.

He turns to move away, then turns back.

                    LARDNER
          Good to have you back.

Eldridge starts the car and they drive away.

(NOTE: Henceforth, "PETE" will be known as "LUKE."  It'll be
easier to keep track of things, since everyone's now calling
him Luke, anyway.  Trust me.)

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  ELDRIDGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY

Harry sits next to the Sheriff, and Luke has the back seat
all to himself.  He leans forward toward the front seat and
taps Harry on the shoulder.

                    LUKE
          Excuse me... what's your, um, your
          name?

                    HARRY
          Harry, son.  Harry.

                    LUKE
          And... what's my name again?

                    HARRY
          Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've
          been "Luke" since you were a baby.

                    LUKE
          Ah.
              (taking it for a spin)
          Luke.  Luke.  I like it.

Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street.

HIS POV

Shops are open for business, TOWNSPEOPLE are going about
their lives.  A few stop and watch as the Sheriff's car goes
by.

                    LUKE
          How long have I been gone?

Eldridge looks at Harry, who stares ahead.

                    LUKE
          How long?

Pause.  The silence is too thick, and Harry has to answer. 
He turns around in his seat and faces Luke.

                    HARRY
              (gently)
          You never came back from the war. 
          We were told you were missing and
          presumed dead.

                    LUKE
          When did I leave?

                    HARRY
          You joined up one month to the day
          after Pearl Harbor.  January
          seventh... nineteen forty-two.

Luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in.

                    HARRY
          Nine and-a-half years ago.

                    LUKE
          Nine and-a-half years...

                    ELDRIDGE
          Comin' up on the Bijou, gents.

EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE BIJOU - DAY

Eldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Here we are.

                    HARRY
          Well, son, you're home!

Luke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open...

HIS POV - THE BIJOU.

The Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of building
styles.  It's as though the architect took random parts of a
Chinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall
and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good
shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly
built the result.

As a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was
"The Bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message

                        " HE B J U"

was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet.

And now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " HE B
J U" sign becomes apparent.  Train tracks run right behind
the building on an elevated trestle.  As we watch, a TRAIN
ROARS BY.  Everything shakes.  It's not an earthquake, it's a
trainquake.  The "J" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening
to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers.

LUKE

stares at the monstrosity.  His face is ashen.  His heart has
sunk to somewhere below his knees.

The Bijou.

Harry jumps out of the car excitedly.

                    HARRY
          Thanks for the lift, Cecil.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Don't mention it.  Welcome home,
          Luke.

                    LUKE
              (faint smile)
          Thanks.

Luke opens the back door and slowly steps out.  Harry grabs
his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket.

                    HARRY
          Wait'll you see the inside!

                    LUKE
              (deadpan)
          Can't wait.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

The interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by
the exterior.  Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in
shards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross
between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with
generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable
combination of questionable taste and neglect.

Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --
probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole
theater --

A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.

Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut
crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and
scatter it in a hundred directions.

TILT DOWN TO REVEAL

Luke and Harry standing below.  Luke is lost in a gulf
somewhere between surprise and disgust.

                    HARRY
          We've been closed for a while.

                    LUKE
              (smiling wanly)
          Ah.

Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one
open.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

The ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem
to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional
row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved
itself up against the row behind or in front.

THE SCREEN

is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin,
framed by ragged red velveteen drapery.

In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old
upright piano.

Luke walks a few steps down the aisle.  He picks a seat on
the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits.  As he
does, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another
seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and
backstage.  Harry comes over and sits behind him.

                    LUKE
              (turning to Harry)
          Exactly how long has the Bijou been
          closed?

                    HARRY
          Hmmmm... after you left, it was
          difficult, and then Lily -- that's
          your mother -- she took ill and
          died... we haven't shown a picture
          since forty-eight.

                    LUKE
          Why?

                    HARRY
              (deep breath)
          Well, after the war, with so many
          of the town's boys killed, people
          around here didn't much feel like
          going to the movies, I guess.  Some
          of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles,
          Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't
          much to keep 'em here, I expect. 
          And now with this "television"
          thing -- people just aren't going
          out as much as they used to.

                    LUKE
          Didn't you have any help?

                    HARRY
          Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but
          they really couldn't help much. 
          Broke their hearts when we closed
          up.  Broke mine, too.
              (brightening)
          But now that you're back, well,
          things will be different around
          here, that's for sure.
              (rises, grabs Luke's arm)
          C'mon, I'll show you where we live.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY

The small apartment above the projection booth is quite a
contrast to the rest of the theater.  It's neat as a pin, and
fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains,
allowing the sun to flood the room.

A beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are

SEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS.

One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke.  It's a
Norman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue
olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  He has one
arm around Harry and the other around his mother.

(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even
in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)

                    HARRY
          The day you shipped out.  That was
          a proud day for your mother and me. 
          Last time you saw her.  Last time I
          saw you.

He smiles.

                    HARRY
          Till today.

Luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine
looking woman.  It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from
the 30's.

                    HARRY
          That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her
          soul.

                    LUKE
              (repeating)
          Mother.
              (to Harry)
          She's beautiful.

                    HARRY
              (coming over)
          Well, yes, that she was.  She
          certainly made this place a home.

He takes the picture from Luke, kisses it, and gently
replaces it on the table.  Luke goes over to the sofa and
sits.

                    HARRY
              (brightly)
          Can I get you anything?  I can put
          some coffee on or some...

Harry looks at Luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleep
on the sofa.

He goes to him, gently picks his feet off the floor, lifts
them onto the sofa.  Removes his shoes, sets them on the
floor.

                                                  CUT TO:

A BLANKET

being drawn up Luke's chest.

HARRY

stands, looks down warmly at his son.  Then, suddenly, he's
seized by a thought.  He turns and crosses to the window.

CLOSE - THE WINDOW

There's a small picture frame in the window.  Harry reaches
down, gingerly picks it up and turns it around.

ON THE FRAME

It's a single, faded gold star.  One war casualty.

Harry clutches it to his chest, looks over at the sleeping
Luke and smiles.

                    HARRY
              (softly)
          When I woke up this morning, my son
          was dead.  Now, I have my boy
          again.
              (closes his eyes)
          I have my boy again.

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT.  BIJOU APARTMENT - MORNING

It's early morning.  Luke is sound asleep, still in his
clothes.  In the distance, a train sounds its HORN.

Luke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly. 
Slowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed.

Something's strange, though.  He frowns.  The train is
GETTING CLOSER.  Luke's eyes POP OPEN.

LUKE'S POV

As the train RUMBLES BY, shaking everything in the room, Luke
looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him. 
Harry, an elderly WOMAN, and an elderly BLACK MAN.

                    HARRY
              (smiling)
          'Morning, Son.

                    ELDERLY WOMAN
              (smiling)
          Good morning, Luke.

                    ELDERLY BLACK MAN
              (no expression)
          'Mornin'.

                    HARRY
          Sleep well?

Luke is speechless.  It he dreaming this?

                    HARRY
          They couldn't wait to see you.

                    LUKE
          Who... are they?

                    HARRY
          This is the staff of the Bijou.

                    LUKE
          Oh.  What... what time is it?

                    HARRY
          Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an
          early start.

Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more
awake.  He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged. 
The elderly woman nudges Harry gently.

                    HARRY
          Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but
          you don't... you need to be re-
          introduced.  Luke, this is Mrs.
          Irene Terwilliger.

Luke stands and shakes MRS. TERWILLIGER'S hand.  She's tiny,
seventy if she's a day.  She smiles and curtsies slightly. 
Her eyes sparkle brightly, her manner almost coquettish.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Head cashier and refreshments
          clerk.  So glad to have you back,
          my boy!
              (to Harry)
          Much more handsome than I remember
          him.

                    HARRY
          And this fine fellow is our head
          usher, resident fix-it man and
          custodian.  Luke, meet Old Tim.
              (to Old Tim)
          You remember Luke, don't you?

OLT TIM is -- well, old.  His clothes are a tad shabby, but
well maintained, though they hang loosely on his gangly
frame.  He wears an old blue knit cap, which he quickly
removes as he shakes Luke's hand.  He's a man of few words,
his manner is painfully shy -- and he never smiles.

                    LUKE
          Is there a young Tim?

                    OLD TIM
          No.

                    LUKE
          Well, then, why do they call you
          "Old Tim?"

Pause.

                    OLD TIM
          I'm old.

Harry steps forward, takes Luke's arm.

                    HARRY
          Well, lots to do, so we'd better
          get a move on...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

Luke, Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger walk down the aisle toward
the screen.  Old Time lags a few steps behind.  At the
orchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit.  The
screen is a sea of repair patches.  Harry pats it.  Dust
flies.

                    HARRY
          'Fraid this has seen better days. 
          Well, I was meaning to get a new
          screen, anyway.

                    OLD TIM
          I n-need me a new uniform.

Luke looks at Old Tim, then at Harry.

                    HARRY
              (to Luke)
          I promised him a new uniform when
          we re-opened.
              (to Old Tim)
          And you'll get one, too.

                    LUKE
          You know, I hate to bring this up,
          but screens and uniforms and paint
          and repairs are going to take
          money, which I'm willing to bet
          none of us has.

Silence from the group.

                    LUKE
          I thought so.

Beat.  Harry brightens, clambers down the steps and races up
the aisle.

                    HARRY
          Anyone want to see the projector?

                                                  CUT TO:

TWO CARBON ARCS

are squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fan
motor.  A puff of smoke, then -- BZZZZZZZZZTT -- LIGHT.  A
metal door is closed over the arcs.

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - DAY

Harry dances around to the other side of the projector and
adjusts the focus on the beam of light.  The others look on
as he gazes at the screen through the tiny window.

                    HARRY
          Beautiful.  Bright and even from
          edge to edge.  See for yourself.

The carbons sputter and die.  The light flickers out.  Harry
is crestfallen, turns off the motor.

                    HARRY
          She's always been a bit tricky.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Mrs. Terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with a
ragged feather duster, a hopeless task.  Old Tim is on a
rickety ladder, replacing burned-out bulbs in the chandelier. 
The orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of the
ladder.

Old Tim climbs down and catches his breath.  Mrs. Terwilliger
sneezes.

                    OLD TIM
          Bless.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Thank you, Timothy.

They both stop their work and glance warily at the door
marked "OFFICE."

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (sotto)
          What do you suppose they're talking
          about?

                    OLD TIM
          Dunno.  Boy's smart.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (brightly)
          Yes, he seems to be.

                    OLD TIM
          Bad for us.

INT.  BIJOU OFFICE - DAY

Luke is poring over the ledger books, adding up figures on an
old manual adding machine.

                    LUKE
          Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the
          books here?

                    HARRY
          No, your mother did, then I did
          after she passed.

                    LUKE
          Well, I'm the first one to admit
          that I don't know anything about
          bookkeeping, but there are some
          very interesting things in here.

He scans down a page.

                    LUKE
              (reading)
          "February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball
          of Fire.'"

                    HARRY
              (appreciatively)
          Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. 
          Yowsa.

                    LUKE
              (reading)
          "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six
          admissions, receipts including
          concessions, $84.75... plus one
          fryer and two-dozen eggs."

He closes the book and looks expectantly at Harry.

                    HARRY
          Yes?

                    LUKE
          "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"

                    HARRY
          Forty-two was a lean year around
          here.  The war had just started...
          you were gone less than a month...
          and we were coming off a bit of a
          drought as I recall.  Not everyone
          could ante up the price of a
          ticket, and a chicken's as good as
          money if you ask me.  At that time,
          it meant a lot to the folks around
          here to be able to come to the
          pictures.

                    LUKE
          Yeah, I know, but poultry...?

                    HARRY
              (rhapsodically)
          I know it's hard to believe, son,
          but this place, this little place
          this wasn't a theater then, this
          was a palace!  Any man, woman,
          child, you, me, it didn't matter,
          you bought your ticket and you
          walked in and you...

Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs.

                    HARRY
          ... you were in a palace.  It was
          like a dream.  It was like heaven,
          like you died and went to a palace
          in heaven, that's what it was like. 
          And spotless, too.

Inspired, Harry stands, takes Luke by the arm.

                    HARRY
          Come with me!

He drags him out of the office and into the lobby.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim watch as Harry leads Luke
through the lobby.

                    HARRY
              (smiling)
          Maybe you had problems and worries
          out there, but once you came
          through that door, they didn't
          matter anymore.  In here, you were
          safe.  Maybe it was just an escape
          from reality, but... oh, god... it
          was beautiful.

Harry leads Luke into the auditorium.  The car follows, but
Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim stay behind.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

Harry trots down the aisle and looks up at the screen.

                    HARRY
              (exuberant)
          Charlie Chaplin.  Keaton and Lloyd. 
          Swanson.  And later on, Clark Gable
          and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy
          Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart
          and Becall and Judy and Mickey...
          and Fred and Ginger.

He turns to Luke.

                    HARRY
              (emphatically)
          They... were... like... gods!

He points to the screen.

                    HARRY
          And that... was the altar.  Would
          you remember if I told you, we felt
          lucky to be here, to have the
          privilege of watching them?
              (sadly)
          This television thing.  Why would
          you want to sit at home and watch a
          little box with a little screen? 
          Because it's convenient?  Because
          you don't have to get dressed and
          put on a coat and a tie and a hat? 
          Because you can just... sit there? 
          How can you call that
          "entertainment," all alone in your
          living room?  Where are the other
          people?  Where's the audience?

Harry comes over to Luke.

                    HARRY
              (emphatically)
          Where's the magic?

He stands behind Luke and whispers in his ear.

                    HARRY
          I'll tell you.  In a place like
          this, the magic is all around you. 
          All the time.  Everywhere.  In
          every thing.

He turns Luke around and looks him in the eye.

                    HARRY
          The trick... is to see it.

Pause.

                    LUKE
          But I...

                    HARRY
          Son, I think you loved the Bijou
          even more than I did.  You've got
          to remember that.  You've got to.

Still looking at Luke, Harry takes a step back, then slowly
walks up the aisle, disappearing into the lobby.

Luke walks down the aisle.  At the edge of the orchestra pit,
he stands looking up at the screen.  The orange tabby cat
MEOWS, and Luke glances toward it, standing onstage by the
edge of the screen.  They exchange looks as we

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Doc Lardner is seated in an easy chair, his feet up, reading
Life magazine.  The radio is on, and Patti Page is singing
"The Tennessee Waltz."

There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up.  In the
entrance hall, the front door opens.

ADELE "DELLY" LARDNER

enters.  She's a strikingly beautiful woman in her late 20s. 
She takes off a felt cap, and her long, auburn hair cascades
down.

                    ADELE
          Dad?

                    LARDNER
          Delly?  In here.

Lardner rises as Adele comes into the living room.  They
embrace warmly.

                    LARDNER
          How'd it go?

                    ADELE
          Not as bad as I thought it would. 
          I think I passed.

                    LARDNER
              (kisses her forehead)
          That's my girl!
              (he hugs her again)
          Did you...?

                    ADELE
          No hiccups, which was good.  Who
          wants an attorney who gets the
          hiccups when she gets nervous?
              ("serious" lawyer voice)
          "Your (hic!) honor, I (hic!)
          object!"

They laugh.

                    LARDNER
          I always told you, baby...
              (taps her head)
          ... it's all up here.

Lardner gives her an extra squeeze, continues to hold onto
her just a bit too long.  Adele detects something amiss.

                    ADELE
          Dad?  What is it?

Beat.

                    LARDNER
          Well, it's...

Adele breaks away from him.

                    ADELE
              (extreme concern)
          Oh my god... who died?

                                                  CUT TO:

A GLASS OF WATER

on a kitchen table.  Offscreen, we HEAR A HICCUP.  Then
another.  Adele's hand reaches into frame.

WIDER

INT.  LARDNER KITCHEN - EVENING

Lardner stands over Adele, who is seated at the table,
holding the glass of water.

                    LARDNER
          Drink slowly.

She raises the glass to her lips.

                    LARDNER
          From the other side of the glass.

It's a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water,
but Adele accomplishes it with aplomb.  She waits for a
moment -- then hiccups again.

                    ADELE
          I think (hic!) it's worse (hic!)
          now.

                    LARDNER
          That always used to work.

                    ADELE
          Yeah, well it's not everyday you
          get (hic!) news like this.  You're
          sure he's (hic!) okay?  Other than
          the (hic!) bump on the head?

                    LARDNER
              (hedging)
          Well...

                    ADELE
          (hic!) Dad... (hic!)

Lardner sits at the table and takes Adele's hand.

                    LARDNER
          He doesn't remember anything,
          Delly.  Doesn't know how he got
          here, doesn't remember his father,
          the town, the Bijou, anyone...

                    ADELE
          ... including me.  Right?  (hic!)

                    LARDNER
          I'm afraid not.  He looked right at
          your picture without batting an
          eye.  But it's probably temporary. 
          He got all the way to Lawson, so he
          clearly knew who he was and what he
          was doing until he hit his head. 
          I'm sure it'll all come back to
          him.  It just takes a catalyst.

                    ADELE
          You mean, (hic!) me?

                    LARDNER
          It's possible.

Off Adele's thoughtful hiccuping, we

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - EVENING

Luke and Harry, walking along, make a turn onto Commerce
Street, heading for Mabel's.  It's still light out, and a
soft breeze skitters some leaves along the sidewalk.

                    HARRY
          I take breakfast and supper at
          Mabel's every day except Sunday. 
          Have for years, since Lily died. 
          If it weren't for Mabel, I'd
          probably starve to death.

ERNIE COLE, a slight, balding man in his 50s, is locking the
door of his pharmacy across the street, when he spots Harry
and Luke.

                    ERNIE
          Harry!  Hold on a second!

Ernie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands
before Luke, staring.  Luke shoots a glance at Harry, who
taps Ernie on the shoulder.

                    HARRY
          It's really him, Ernie.

                    ERNIE
              (agape)
          Well, I'll be...

He sticks his hand out and Luke takes it.  Ernie pumps it
enthusiastically.

                    ERNIE
          By god, Luke, if it isn't good to
          see you again.

                    LUKE
              (uncertain)
          Uh, thanks.  Good to see you again,
          too, uh...

                    HARRY
          Ernie.

                    LUKE
          ... Ernie.

                    ERNIE
              (still at a lose)
          Well, I'll be...

                    HARRY
          We were just gonna get some supper. 
          Would you like to join us?

                    ERNIE
          Would I ever!

The three walk toward the diner, but before they get two
steps, they hear:

                    WOMAN'S VOICE
          Is that Luke Trumbo?

They turn to see a stout woman, KATIE RUTHERFORD, 40s,
rushing toward them.  She rushes right into a very surprised
Luke's arms and hugs him tightly.

                    KATIE
          Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you
          back!

                    HARRY
          Katie, would you like to join us
          for dinner?  The more, the merrier.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  MABEL'S DINER - NIGHT

The diner is packed.  In addition to Ernie and Katie, MEN,
WOMEN and CHILDREN occupy every seat and table, and many more
are standing, even hanging out the door.

At the focus of the crowd are Luke and Harry, seated at the
counter.  Harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner, while
Luke is working on a steak.  A young man seated at the
opposite side of the counter is speaking.  He's CARL LEFFERT,
30s.

                    CARL
              (eagerly)
          Hey, Luke, remember the time you
          and me, we was playing with
          firecrackers and the one you was
          lighting blew up too soon and
          singed all the hair offa my head?

A few people shake their heads, smile and laugh.

                    LUKE
          Uh, no.  What happened?

                    CARL
              (deflated)
          Well... um, all the hair got singed
          offa my head.  It was pretty funny.

A couple of TITTERS are heard.

                    LUKE
          Oh.

                    CARL
          Even my eyebrows.  But they grew
          back.

Luke leans toward Harry, who never looks up from his chicken.

                    HARRY
          Carl.  Friend of yours from high
          school.  Everybody calls him
          "Cueball."

                    LUKE
              (sincerely)
          Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.

                    CARL
              (brightening)
          Oh, heck, that's all right.  It's
          just good to have you back.  Isn't
          that right, Bob?  Hey, Luke, you
          remember my brother Bob?  You two
          joined up the same day.

Luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to Carl.

BOB LEFFERT

is a good-looking fellow, a few years older than Carl.  His
face is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down on
his forehead.  He looks up at Luke with hollow eyes.  Brings
his right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up.  Except
there's no hand there -- it's a hook.

                    LUKE
              (quietly)
          Hey, Bob.  Good to meet you.

Bob doesn't react.  He glances away, and for a moment, his
eyes meet Mabel's.  She smiles warmly.  He turns away.

Ernie Cole pipes up.

                    ERNIE
          Luke, I know there's a question
          that's on everybody's mind.

                    LUKE
          What's that?

                    ERNIE
          Well, now that you're back, what're
          your plans?

All eyes on Luke.  He freezes, having just taken a forkful of
food in his mouth.  Harry jumps in.

                    HARRY
          Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's
          what.

A MURMUR goes through the crowd.  Stanton Lawson, standing
behind Luke, taps him on the shoulder.

                    STANTON
          That true?

                    LUKE
              (on the spot)
          Well... we're gonna try.

                    ERNIE
          That's a lot of work, son.  Place's
          been closed, what, three, four
          years now.  Gonna be tough.

                    HARRY
          If it's tough, that means it's
          worth doing.

Someone shouts "That's the spirit!," another shouts "Hear,
hear!," and a chorus of VOICES join in agreement.

                    ERNIE
          Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt?

                    SPENCER'S VOICE
          Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor.

                    ERNIE
          Well, come on out here so's we can
          see you.

SPENCER WYATT steps around from the back of the crowd near
the door.  He's a tall, dark-haired, gangly, bespectacled
kid, no more than 19 or 20.  Painfully shy, he clutches a
clarinet case to his chest.  He timidly smiles and waves at
Luke, who smiles and nods back.

                    SPENCER
          Hey, Luke.

                    LUKE
          Hi, Spencer.

                    ERNIE
          Spence, that band of yours -- you
          think they're ready to play?
              (to Luke)
          Spencer and his pals went ahead and
          got together a good ol' big band.

                    SPENCER
          We've been practicing... uh, sure,
          I guess.

                    ERNIE
          Well, how about tomorrow night,
          eight p.m., in city hall square? 
          What I'm proposin' is a "Welcome
          Home Luke" celebration.

Vociferous general AGREEMENT from the crowd -- which is
quickly quieted by a MURMUR, which starts at the front door. 
The crowd parts and grow silent, revealing a woman standing
in the doorway.

ADELE

She locks eyes with Luke.  Her hand goes to her mouth and her
eyes well up.  Slowly, she moves around the counter, the
crowd moving aside for her.

She stands in front of Luke, who has stood up to meet her. 
Her eyes moist, she looks up at him.

                    ADELE
          Do you... remember me?

                    LUKE
          I've seen you before.  Your
          picture...

Mabel, clutching a napkin, leans over to Katie.

                    MABEL
              (sotto)
          Look!

                    LUKE
          ... but I don't think I remember
          you.

Adele leans up and kisses him softly.  He looks at her.

                    LUKE
          But I'll sure try.

As Mabel and Katie dab at their eyes, we

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - NIGHT

Adele and Luke stroll down the street side by side.  She
looks at him for a long moment.

                    LUKE
          What.

                    ADELE
          No, I... I just wondering where
          you've been all this time.

                    LUKE
          Me too.

                    ADELE
          You look... different.

                    LUKE
          I do?

                    ADELE
          Yeah, a little.  I think you grew
          an inch or so.  And you've lost
          weight.

                    LUKE
          I did?  Huh!

Tentatively, she takes his hand and holds it.  From behind
them, we HEAR A SHUFFLING SOUND.  Adele turns...

ADELE'S POV

Keeping a discreet distance, EVERYONE from the diner is
following them.  Adele turns and addresses the crowd.

                    ADELE
              (to the group)
          You can all go home, now.  He's not
          going anywhere.

                    LUKE
          Go on home, folks.  And thanks for
          the welcome.

Harry comes over.

                    LUKE
          I'll be home in a little while,
          Harry.  Don't wait up.

                    HARRY
          You two have a lot of catching up
          to do, I guess.

                    LUKE
          You bet.

                    HARRY
          Goodnight, son.
              (tips his hat)
          'Night, Delly.

And the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing the
pair goodnight.  Luke and Adele watch them disperse.

                    LUKE
          There.  We're alone.

They turn and start walking.

                    ADELE
          Then why do I feel like we're still
          being shadowed?

                    LUKE
          Well... where can we go?

Adele brightens.

                    ADELE
          I know a place.  Come on!

She grabs his hand and they run toward the town square.

EXT.  LAWSON CITY HALL - NIGHT

Adele and Luke stand by the front steps.

                    LUKE
          City hall?

                    ADELE
          You must not remember anything. 
          Come on.

She grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building.

EXT.  SIDE OF CITY HALL - NIGHT

Adele and Luke stand by a basement window, inches off the
ground.  She looks around.  Certain the coast is clear, she
pounds on the window in three "special" places, and it pops
up and open.  She looks at Luke.

                    ADELE
          You first.

                    LUKE
          Why me?

                    ADELE
          Be a gentleman.  You have to help
          me down.

AS LUKE CLIMBS IN, WE

                                                  CUT TO:

A LARGE, MUSLIN-COVERED OBJECT.

Slowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing A STATUE OF A
KNEELING SOLIDER, praying before a soldier's grave.  We
slowly PAN DOWN from the top of the statue... 

INT.  CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

                    ADELE (O.S.)
          When we were kids, my Dad was
          mayor, and you and me and a bunch
          of others used to come down here
          all the time.

ON ADELE AND LUKE

looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage
room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the
window.  The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet.

                    ADELE
          Of course, there was a lot more
          room before they stuck the memorial
          down here.

                    LUKE
              (looks at the door)
          How'd they get it inside?

                    ADELE
          Through the door.  It comes apart.

She moves to the memorial.  Squinting, she examines its base.

                    ADELE
          Your name's on here.  See?

Luke comes over.

ON THE BASE OF THE MEMORIAL -- LUKE'S NAME

                    ADELE
          Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." 
          And all the others.  I knew them
          all.  So did you.  We went to
          school with most of them.

                    LUKE
          It doesn't seem right, this being
          down here.  It ought to be where
          people can see it.

                    ADELE
          After they commissioned it, no one
          could ever agree on where to put
          it.  The Methodists wanted it in
          front of the Methodist Church, the
          Presbyterians wanted it in front of
          the Presbyterian Church, the city
          council wanted it in the lobby of
          City Hall.  Everyone finally got
          tired of the fighting.  So they
          stuck it down here.

He looks at her for a long moment.  There's an electricity
between them, and they both feel it.

                    LUKE
          So, you're really gonna be a
          lawyer?

                    ADELE
              (suddenly defensive)
          And why not?

                    LUKE
          Whoa.

                    ADELE
              (smiling)
          Sorry.  You don't know how many
          times I've heard that.  "A lady
          lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a
          woman couldn't be as good a lawyer
          as a man.  Or better, in fact.

                    LUKE
          Have you always wanted to be a
          lawyer?

                    ADELE
          You... don't remember, but yes,
          ever since I was a little girl.

                    LUKE
          What did... what did I want to be?

                    ADELE
              (gently)
          Oh, well... I guess you... in high
          school, you were a pretty good
          first baseman.  And we were on the
          debate team together.  But... I
          think you were gonna run the Bijou. 
          You were brought up there, and you
          loved it so much.  And I think you
          knew how much the town needed a
          place like that.

He turns away, rubs his head.

                    LUKE
          I just wish I could remember some
          of this.

He turns back to her.

                    LUKE
          You don't have a boyfriend or
          anyone... you know... like that?

                    ADELE
          Actually, I was married.  For four
          years.  But... well, we didn't fit
          together.  I'm divorced now.

                    LUKE
          I'm sorry.

                    ADELE
          No, it's okay.  See, when two
          people belong together, the other
          person should be the... the key
          that unlocks the rest of you... I'm
          not making sense, am I?

                    LUKE
              (moving toward her)
          No, you are.  I know exactly what
          you mean.  It's not that you're
          missing something.  It's that the
          other person gives something to
          you... that you had all the time. 
          You just didn't see it until they
          came along.

                    ADELE
              (smiling)
          Yeah...

Pause.

                    LUKE
          We were in love... weren't we?

                    ADELE
              (quietly)
          Yes.
              (then:)
          Hic!

She instantly covers her mouth, but it's no good.  She has
the hiccups again.

                    LUKE
          What was that?

                    ADELE
          Nothing.  (hic!)

                    LUKE
          Do you have the...

                    ADELE
          I'm (hic!) fine.  Really.  (hic!)

Luke smiles and watches Adele as she makes the decision to
not struggle against the hiccups.  She has them, and that's
just the way it is.

                    LUKE
          Were we going to get married?

                    ADELE
          Eventually.  We were going to be
          (hic!) engaged... when you came
          back from (hic!) overseas...

He looks at her.  She's strikingly beautiful at this
particular moment and in this particular light -- hiccups and
all.  He moves closer to her.  She moves closer to him.

                    ADELE
              (breathless)
          ... but you had to go... serve
          (hic!) your country...

They kiss passionately.  She reaches up and puts her arms
around him.  He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly
realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.

                    ADELE
          Hey... it worked.

And as she smiles and kisses him again we

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  THE BIJOU - NIGHT

Luke comes down the street and heads for the front door.  He
has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys
and enters.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

It's very dark.  Luke is about to swing shut the heavy door,
when he looks down and sees

THE ORANGE TABBY CAT

shoot into the lobby, stopping in the middle of the floor. 
It looks at Luke, and PURRS.

Luke closes the door and moves to the cat.  He crouches down
and pets it, and its back rises to meet his hand.

                    LUKE
          Hey, fella.  So you live here, too,
          huh?  How come Harry didn't mention
          that?

The cat moves to the auditorium door, pausing to look back at
Luke.  Curiosity piqued, Luke follows the cat.

INT.  BIJOU BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

In the dim light, we SEE an old mop and pail, some dirty film
cans, and a large beat-up cardboard standee of "The Tramp"
with the legend, "Chaplin Short To-Day."

The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door
at the end of a hallway.  Luke, following the cat, comes
around the same corner and looks at

THE DOOR.

Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as
the sound of Old Tim softly humming "It's a Long Way to
Tipperary."

Luke moves to the door and knocks.

                    LUKE
          Um, Old Tim?  Sorry, it's late. 
          It's Luke.  Can I come in?

The humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open,
revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat,
stroking its fur.

                    OLD TIM
          Found me.

                    LUKE
          Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I
          didn't know anyone lived here...
          well, besides Harry.  And me.

Old Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow
him.

INT.  OLD TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot,
which is perfectly made, military-style.

                    OLD TIM
          Not used to visitors.
              (gesturing)
          Sit.

Old Tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to
the "kitchen" area -- a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny
icebox.

Luke sits in the chair, and Old Tim sits on the cot, facing
him.  Silence.  Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau.

ON THE PHOTO

It's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious and
handsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform.

The cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke.  He
rubs against his legs, purring.  Luke leans down to pet him.

                    LUKE
          So I guess this fellow belongs to
          you.  What's his name?

                    OLD TIM
          Cat.

                    LUKE
          Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.
              (pets Cat)
          Hi, Cat.

                    OLD TIM
              (sudden change-of-subject)
          We thought you was dead, you know.
              (another new thought)
          It's okay that I live here?

                    LUKE
          Of course.

Pause, then suddenly.

                    OLD TIM
          Do you think I'll get me a new u-u
          uniform?

Luke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaks
more than a couple of words.

                    LUKE
          I'll do everything I can.

Old Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached.

                    OLD TIM
          T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I
          always... I always wanted to wear
          my uniform from the Great War, but
          your daddy, he always said no,
          that's not an usher's u-u-uniform,
          that's an army uniform and the
          Bijou, she's not the army.  They
          give me a medal, but I lost it in
          the h-h-hospital.  I forget things
          sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.

                    LUKE
          Yeah... me too.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY

It's a pretty typical bachelor's apartment.  The "SAND
PIRATES" poster leans up against a chair.  Pete's two boxes
of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table, the
empty bottle of Jack Daniels on top.

There's an insistent KNOCK at the door.

                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?  You
          in there?  This is the Super, I
          have the master key and I'm coming
          in!

We HEAR the key in the lock and the door swings open,
revealing the building SUPER, 50s.  Behind him is Leo
Kubelsky.  They enter the room, and the Super sniffs the air.

                    LEO
          You smell gas?

                    SUPER
          Don't smell nothin'.  He must not
          be dead in here.

          Hey, it's the best way to tell.

Leo moves to the boxes and rummages through them.  He picks
up the empty bottle, examines it.

                    SUPER
          You think he's drunk somewhere?

                    LEO

          Wouldn't blame him if he was.

                    SUPER
          Well, his rent's past due and he
          said to call you in case of an
          emergency.  He lose his job or
          somethin'?

               money)
          What's his rent?

                    SUPER
          Thirty a month.

Leo peels off a hundred-dollar bill.

                    LEO
          Here's three months rent, and a ten
          spot for no more questions and to
          keep an eye on his place.  Now, I
          need a moment alone.

                    SUPER
              (examining the bill)
          Huh?

                    LEO
          Take a hike.  Am-scray.

                    SUPER
          Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door
          shut when you leave.

The Super exits and Leo crosses to the phone and dials "O."

INT.  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

ON A DOOR

It reads: "OFFICE OF THE MAJORITY COUNSEL - MR. ELVIN CLYDE"

AGENT WALTER SAUNDERS and AGENT STEVEN BRETT, both 30s and G-
men to the core, hustle into the office.

INT.  ELVIN CLYDE'S OFFICE - DAY

ELVIN CLYDE is 35, a small, thin-lipped, reptilian man in the
Roy Cohn mold.  He's on the phone at the moment.

                    CLYDE
              (into phone)
          You say you know nothing about it. 
          You say this, yet you offer no
          proof.  How am I supposed to
          believe you?

Clyde's SECRETARY knocks on the door, sticks her head in.

                    SECRETARY
          Mr. Clyde?  Agents Saunders and
          Brett need to see you.

                    CLYDE
              (covering the phone)
          You do see that I'm busy, do you
          not?

                    SECRETARY
          It's about Appleton.

Clyde's eyes brighten.

                    CLYDE
          Tell them to come in.
              (into phone)
          I'll have to call you back.  I love
          you too, Mother.

Saunders and Brett stride into the office.

                    SAUNDERS
          We've got a situation developing...

                    CLYDE
              (interrupting)
          Will you take those goddamn hats
          off?

They stop, shuck off their hats.  Saunders starts over again.

                    SAUNDERS
          We've got a situation developing
          out on the coast.  Appleton's just
          been reported missing.

Clyde grins darkly.

                    CLYDE
          This is good.  This is very good.

          No signs of forced entry or

Clyde considers this for a beat, then:

                    CLYDE
          You two are on this as of now. 
          Tell the LAPD their investigation
          has been federalized on my order. 
          You find me this Appleton.
              (leans back, smiling)
          I want to see what this one has to
          say.

INT.  BIJOU OFFICE - DAY

Luke is sitting at the desk, making notes and adding up some
figures.  He puts his pencil down and rubs his eyes, then
looks up at

HARRY AND OLD TIM

who are sitting on the floor, going through piles of lobby
cards and folded one-sheets like little boys fascinated with
their baseball cards.

He shifts his gaze to

MRS. TERWILLIGER

who is straightening out and dusting the tops of the two or
three file cabinets in the corner of the office.  As she
works, she hums an old song, occasionally breaking into the
lyrics:

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (sings)
          "The object of my affection, Can
          change my complexion, From white to
          rosy red..."

Luke takes a breath:

                    LUKE
          Well...

                    HARRY
          Yes?

                    LUKE
          Between a new screen, paint,
          plumbing for the concession stand,
          and about a hundred other repairs
          around the theater... it's going to
          cost at least nine hundred dollars
          to get the Bijou into shape to open
          up.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Oh, my.

                    HARRY
              (taken aback)
          Nine hundred...

                    LUKE
          And you have sixty-eight dollars
          and thirty-seven cents in the bank. 
          Your only source of income are my
          veteran's death benefit of forty
          dollars a month, to which you're no
          longer entitled since I'm alive,
          and these ten dollar a month cash
          deposits you make.  What are those?

                    HARRY
              (glances at Old Tim)
          They're...

          Oh.

                    HARRY
          It's all my fault.  I was
          neglectful and this is the price of
          that.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Don't say that.

                    HARRY
          Well, it's true.  Wanting to open
          this place back up.  It's folly,
          Irene, pure and simple.  Might as
          well just call it what it is.

It's tiny, with rounded corners, black-and-white, and a
hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow.

WIDER

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Doc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television
set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "Your Show
of Shows."  He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit
ears, steps back -- and is successful.  SID CAESAR And
IMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch,
and Lardner fairly roars with laughter.

He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so,
the reception goes haywire.  He returns to the spot in front
of the TV, and the picture is perfect again.

The DOORBELL RINGS.  He's torn -- if he moves, the picture
will break up.  The doorbell RINGS again, and we HEAR Adele's
voice from upstairs:

                    ADELE (O.S.)
          Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him
          in?  I'll be right down.

                    LARDNER
          Honey, I... I can't... it's the...

There's a KNOCK at the door.

                    LARDNER
              (giving in)
          Oh, hell...

He moves from his spot.  The reception goes bad, and he
marches to the door.

He opens it, and Luke is standing there, wearing a slightly
out-of-date coat and tie.

                    LARDNER
          Evening, Luke.

                    LUKE
          Evening, Doctor Lardner.

Lardner freezes, staring at Luke.

                    LUKE
          What's wrong?

                    LARDNER
              (shaken from his reverie)
          Uh, no... just seeing you standing
          there, it reminded me... there's a
          word for it...

                    LUKE
          Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept
          all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but
          it's a little big.

Adele comes down the stairs.  Halfway down, she stops
suddenly and stares at Luke.

                    ADELE
          Oh...

Awkward pause.  Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at
Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.

                    LUKE
          I shouldn't have worn the suit.

Adele comes down the stairs.

                    ADELE
          No... you were wearing that suit
          the last time we went out before...

                    LUKE
          Oh...

                    ADELE
          ... and It's just... well, deja vu.

                    LARDNER
          That's it.  Deja vu.

Another awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other. 
Lardner breaks it.

                    LARDNER
          You kids off to the dance?

                    LUKE
          Aren't you coming?

                    LARDNER
          No, I'm not much of a dancer.

                    ADELE
              (chidingly)
          Besides, Daddy's still trying to
          figure out how to get his new
          television set working.

                    LARDNER
          I had it, a minute ago...

He glances at the TV set.  The picture is suddenly crystal
clear.

                    LARDNER
          ... ooooh, It's back.
              (encouraging them toward
               the door)
          Well, you kids have fun now...

Adele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights
with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living
room.

S-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the TV
carefully all the while.  The reception is staying perfect. 
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business,
and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.  He stifles
his urge, and heads for his chair.  Gingerly, he sits.  Still
perfect.

Satisfied, he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up. 
The picture goes completely haywire again.

                    LARDNER
          Aw, crap.

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Adele and Luke walk along, arm-in-arm.

                    ADELE
          This is strange.  Do you feel it?

                    LUKE
          What?

                    ADELE
          We've done this before, so many
          times.  The last time was so long
          ago, but it feels like yesterday.

                    LUKE
          Oh.

Pause.

                    ADELE
          You know, everyone's so excited
          about the Bijou re-opening...

                    LUKE
              (interrupting)
          It's gonna cost over nine hundred
          dollars to open the place, Delly.

                    ADELE
              (shocked)
          Nine hundred...

                    LUKE
          Yeah, and needless to say, none of
          us has that kind of money lying
          around.

                    ADELE
          What about a loan?  You could go to
          the bank...?

                    LUKE
          A loan to a man who ran his
          business into the ground and his
          son who can't account for the last
          nine-and-a-half years of his life? 
          Not likely.

                    ADELE
          Well, there's got to be a way...

                    LUKE
              (suddenly)
          Have you got a cigarette?

Adele stops.

                    ADELE
          When did you start smoking?

                    LUKE
          I don't smoke?

                    ADELE
          You tried to once.  It was pretty
          pitiful.

                    LUKE
          Oh.

Adele glances curiously at Luke as we

                                                  CUT TO:

A CLARINET

launching into the opening bars of "Don't Be That Way," an
old Benny Goodman tune.

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY

Spencer Wyatt's big ban is comprised of a dozen or so
MUSICIANS about Spencer's age -- except for the drummer,
AVERY WYATT, 40s, Spencer's dad.  Though no Gene Krupa, he
pounds the skins pretty well, all the while smiling proudly
as his son plays clarinet and leads the band.

Despite the last minute decorations, the Square looks nice,
hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights.

ON LUKE AND ADELE

dancing to the music, along with several other COUPLES.

                    LUKE
              (nodding toward the band)
          They're not bad.

                    ADELE
          No, they're not.  I'd say your
          investment was paying dividends.

                    LUKE
          My what?

                    ADELE
          Back in '37, you heard Benny
          Goodman play for the first time, so
          you went out and got a used
          clarinet.  You wanted nothing more
          than to be able to play like him. 
          You tried hard, but it wasn't long
          before it was clear that Benny
          Goodman would never be looking over
          his shoulder.  So you gave the
          clarinet to Spencer.

                    LUKE
          Huh.  That was nice of me.

                    ADELE
          You had a hidden agenda, though. 
          See, when he was five or six,
          little Spence used to follow you
          around like a puppy.  Bothered the
          hell out of you.  But as soon as
          you gave him the clarinet...

                    LUKE
          ... he started practicing, and he
          left me alone from then on.

                    ADELE
          Exactly.  And he got good.

                    LUKE
          No kidding.

They dance a bit.

                    ADELE
          Now, did you remember that, or...

                    LUKE
          Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.

                    ADELE
          Oh.  Okay.

And as they dance away, we

Luke is pouring two glasses of punch, while Adele is being
shyly admired (and having her ear bent) by two twin brothers,
ALEX and CHARLIE MCKENNA, mid-20s.

          Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end.

The brothers laugh goofily.

          what's her name...?

          It's called the State Bar Exam.

Adele and Luke are slow dancing to "Thanks for the Memory."

                    LUKE
          How do you tell those two apart,
          anyway?

                    ADELE
          Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is
          the smarter one.

                    LUKE
          That's... pretty frightening.

They laugh and dance a bit more.

                    ADELE
          Your dancing's very good.

                    LUKE
          Thanks.

                    ADELE
          It never used to be.  You were two
          left feet on the dance floor.  Like
          pulling teeth to get you to do a
          little box step.

                    LUKE
          Guess I must've learned.

Luke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on
her face.  The band finishes the song, and everyone
enthusiastically APPLAUDS.  Spencer bows shyly, blushing
slightly.  He nods to the band, and they bow before he
motions for the crowd's attention.

                    SPENCER
              (nervously)
          Thanks, folks.  Gee, can you tell
          we never played in front of people
          before?

The crowd yells "No!," "You guys sound great!," etc.

                    SPENCER
          Well, this is our first time, and
          it's really all because of Luke.  I
          mean, it's because of Luke coming
          back that we're here tonight -- but
          I'm talking about this.

He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees
Luke.

                    SPENCER
              (to Luke)
          When you didn't come back, I
          learned how to play this so I could
          remember you.  And now that you're
          back, well, I'll never forget you.
              (to the crowd)
          Luke gave me this clarinet, but he
          gave this night to all of us.

The crowd APPLAUDS warmly.

                    SPENCER
          Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!

The crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser.  He
turns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums.

                    ERNIE
          Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?

Avery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or six
times to register his reaction.

ON THE KICK DRUM -- "WYATT'S HARDWARE, LAWSON, CALIF."

                    ERNIE
          Looks like you might have to find
          someone else to mix paint at the
          store, 'cause I think Spencer's got
          a big career ahead of him.

APPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle.  As soon as
he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent.

                    ERNIE
          You know folks, here in Lawson, we
          gave a lot for our country.  A lot. 
          And we never complained and we
          never faltered.  And we never
          forgot.

Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion.  He clears his
throat and continues.

                    ERNIE
          We never forgot.  And so when one
          of our own came back to us, I gotta
          tell you folks, it was like a
          miracle.  Luke, seein' you walking
          down the street, it was... well, it
          was kinda like seein' one of my
          boys alive again.  I think I speak
          for everyone here when I say that
          not a day goes by when we don't
          keep our boys' memories alive.  But
          Luke, having you back among us...
          well, it helps us keep their
          spirits alive, too.  God bless you,
          son.

The crowd APPLAUDS.  Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles. 
Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject.

                    ERNIE
          All right, enough a'that.  This is
          a celebration, so let's have us a
          good time -- but not too good a
          time, 'cause I see just about every
          member of the city council here
          tonight, and we have an eight a.m. 
          council meeting tomorrow morning,
          and I expect y'all to be there! 
          All right, take it away, Spencer!

And Spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAME - LATER

Luke and Adele come over to Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger,
standing at the periphery.  Old Tim stands a few feet back.

                    LUKE
          Why don't you two get out there and
          dance?

                    HARRY
          Oh, no, I...

Mrs. Terwilliger blushes.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          I haven't danced with another man
          since Mr. Terwilliger passed.

                    LUKE
          When was that?

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Nineteen-oh-nine.

Harry touches Luke's arm.

                    HARRY
          Son, we're gonna go.  You two kids
          have a lovely time.

Goodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves.  Alex McKenna
comes up to Adele and taps her on the shoulder.

                    ALEX
          Delly, can I have a dance?

                    ADELE
          Sure.

Alex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a
little "help me!" look.  Luke smiles back and watches the
dancing crowd.  After a moment, a man in a white suit and bow
tie, ROSCOE FITTS, 40s, comes over to Luke and extends his
hand.

                    FITTS
          Luke, you probably don't remember
          me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer
          here in town.

                    LUKE
              (shakes his hand)
          Good to meet you.  Again.

                    FITTS
          Like Ernie said, we're all glad to
          have you back.

                    LUKE
          Thanks.

                    FITTS
          And I hear you and Harry are
          planning on re-opening the Bijou.

                    LUKE
          We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot
          of work.

                    FITTS
          I can only imagine.  You know, I
          spoke with your Dad last year about
          maybe taking the Bijou off his
          hands.  I don't think he gave it
          very much thought.

                    LUKE
          Well, he loves the place.  It's his
          home.

                    FITTS
          Luke, I'm hopping you can help him
          see the reality of the situation. 
          I'll come to the point.  I want to
          buy the property, and I'm prepared
          to offer six-thousand dollars for
          it.  And that's just for the
          property, mind you.  If you want,
          I'll leave it to you and your
          father to dismantle and liquidate
          the building for whatever salvage
          value it has, and you keep those
          proceeds.  I just want the land.

                    LUKE
              (taken aback)
          That's... well, that's very
          generous, but if you've already got
          a store...?

                    FITTS
          The days of the storefront grocery
          are numbered.  I plan on putting up
          a free-standing supermarket.

                    LUKE
              (it's an alien word)
          A super market.  Huh.

                    FITTS
          You think it over.  No reason to
          risk financial ruin for the sake of
          a crumbling old building.

Fitts takes Luke's hand and shakes it.

                    FITTS
          Good to have you back, Luke.

As Luke watches Fitts walk off, we

                                                  CUT TO:

THE SAME - LATER

ON SPENCER

                    SPENCER
          Last dance, folks!

The crowd MOANS slightly, and Spencer kicks the band into
"Moonlight Serenade," slow and easy.

ON ADELE AND LUKE

As they hold each other close and dance.  Adele rests her
head on Luke's shoulder, her eyes closed.  Luke strokes her
hair and sways her gently to the music.

Luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor.

LUKE'S POV

Bob Leffert is standing there, staring at the band.  Mabel
comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.  She's
asking him if he would like to dance.  Bob looks down at the
ground, self-consciously shoves his hook-hand in his pocket
and moves away, leaving Mabel standing there.

As Luke watches and the MUSIC CONTINUES OVER, WE

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE:

Luke and Adele dancing...

... walking slowly arm-in-arm down Adele's street, up her
walk to her door...

... kissing passionately on her doorstep...

... Adele going inside and Luke walking away, each unable to
take their eyes off the other...

... Luke walking the quiet streets of Lawson, smiling
beatifically...

                                        MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  THE BIJOU - NIGHT

Luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door.  He
pulls out his keys and enters.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Luke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees

CAT

MEOWING at him from the sidewalk.  He holds the door open,
and Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the
auditorium.  Luke closes the door... and stops.  He HEARS
something, and so do we.  Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. 
The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby.

Luke turns toward the music, which is coming from the
auditorium.  The piano continues, building slightly in
volume.  He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively
pushes one open.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Luke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering,
reflected light of

THE SCREEN.

The movie is "The Big Parade."  The old, decomposing nitrate
print is badly scratched and stained.  A young, beautiful
Renee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John
Gilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War.

Luke stares at the screen.  The look on his face is one of
bewilderment -- and awe.

ANGLE - THE PIANO

The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out-
of-tune.  But it really doesn't matter.

CLOSER

Mrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately.  She never takes
her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered
screen, except to close them when she is overcome with
emotion.  Even so, she never misses a beat.

HER HANDS

fairly dance upon the keys.  Stiff and wrinkled as they are,
they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity
that the old piano can muster.

Luke is moved by what he's witnessing.  This is the magic...

WIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION

To the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old
Tim.  Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene
unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and
nose with a handkerchief.  He doesn't notice

LUKE

who looks up towards the projection booth.

                                                  CUT TO:

A BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT,

filling the frame.  We're looking directly into the beam of
light radiating from the projector.

PUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the
booth.  We come out of the beam and can just barely make out
the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the
projector.

WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's
face fills the screen.  He is watching the film; his eyes are
wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's
unfolding on the screen for the very first time.

The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES,
signaling the end of the reel.  Harry moves away from the
window.

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Never taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the
film comes to an end and flap!  falp!  falps!  out of the
projector.  He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs
apart, and the bright beam dies.  It's not the end of the
movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have.

Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades
them up.  This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back
pocket and blows his nose loudly.

He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up
reel and takes it down.  He's about to move away, when he
senses that he's not alone.  He looks over the projector to
see

LUKE,

standing there.  Their eyes meet.  Someone should say
something -- both men search for words.  Suddenly, Luke feels
very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's
interrupted a very private ritual.

Harry senses this.  Clutching the precious reel of film
tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles
warmly.

                    HARRY
          Beautiful, wasn't it?

                    LUKE
              (softly)
          Yes.

                    HARRY
          Well, son, I wish I could've shown
          you more, but this is all that's
          left.  Just this one reel that
          never got sent back from a picture
          we showed here a long time ago. 
          Nineteen twenty-five, to be
          exact...

                    LUKE
          Dad, I...

                    HARRY
              (a tiny laugh)
          Ha!

                    LUKE
          ... what?

                    HARRY
          You know, since you've been back,
          that's the first time you've called
          me "Dad."

Father and son look at each other for a long moment --
searching each other's eyes.  Harry smiles a sort-of half-
smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the
rewind bench.  Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end
of the film onto an empty reel.  Slowly, he begins to turn
the crank, rewinding the film.

He stops and looks to where Luke was standing... but he's not
there.

ANGLE - PROJECTION BOOTH DOOR

Luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the
projection booth.

ONE LUKE

As he closes his eyes...

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

ON HARRY

In bed, sound asleep, snoring.  A HAND reaches into frame and
shakes him awake.

                    LUKE'S VOICE
          Harry.  Dad, wake up.  Wake up.

Harry opens his eyes and looks up.

INT.  HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

                    HARRY
              (bleary)
          Luke... what time is it?

                    LUKE
          Six-thirty.
              (smiles)
          I thought we'd get an early start.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CITY COUNCIL MEETING ROOM - DAY

A meeting of the Lawson City Council is in session, Mayor
Cole presiding.  Of the dozen council MEMBERS, we also
recognize Avery Wyatt and Roscoe Fitts.  VERA DWIGHT, the
council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading
the minutes of the last meeting.

                    VERA
          Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and
          Red Curtis seconded, that the
          council form a committee to
          investigate the adoption of a new
          property taxation structure. 
          Motion carried, nine to two, one
          abstention.

As Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry,
Old Time and Mrs. Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on
the unoccupied benches.

                    ERNIE
          Thanks, Vera.

Ernie notices Luke and the trio.

                    ERNIE
          Well, the chair notes the presence
          this morning of Luke and Harry
          Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou
          staff.  Frankly, the chair notes
          the presence of just about anyone
          who ever finds their way into one
          of these meetings.  G'moring,
          folks.

                    LUKE & THE TRIO
          Good morning.

                    ERNIE
          I'm just guessing, but I bet it's
          not a sudden interest in Lawson
          politics that brings you all here.

Luke stands.

                    LUKE
          Well, no...
              (clears his throat)
          I wanted to thank you all for
          giving me such a nice welcome, and
          making me feel at home.  But I...
          we're... actually here on business
          of a sort...

DALEY THORNHILL, 30s, the council parliamentarian, pipes up. 
He's waving a copy of "Roberts Rules of Order."

                    DALEY
          Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this
          comes under the heading "New
          Business," and this is not the
          time...

                    ERNIE
          I think we can make an exception
          here, Daley.

                    DALEY
          It'll need to be moved and
          seconded.

Ernie rolls his eyes, then quickly and mechanically, without
inflection:

                    ERNIE
          All right, motion to hear the
          speaker out of order.

                    WYATT
          Seconded.

                    ERNIE
          Motion on the floor, discussion
          open, discussion closed, all those
          in favor signify by saying "aye."

                    ALL
          Aye.

                    ERNIE
          Opposed?  Hearing no opposition,
          the motion is carried.

Pause.  Ernie turns to Luke and smiles.

                    ERNIE
          Go ahead, son.

                    LUKE
          Thanks.  Well, I'll make this short
          and sweet.  The Bijou needs a lot
          of repairs, and the truth of the
          matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad
          and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old
          Tim, we can't possible afford them
          all.  So, I'd like to ask your help
          to... well, to scrounge around a
          bit, and see if you have anything
          that might help us out.

                    WYATT
          What kinds of things are you
          talking about?

                    LUKE
          Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light
          bulbs, yardage, and if you can't
          come up with any of that, we can
          use some old-fashioned elbow
          grease.

Fitts leans forward.

                    FITTS
          So... you do intend to fix the
          place up after all?

                    LUKE
          Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I
          think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit
          more than it needs a super market. 
          And I think Lawson deserves the
          Bijou.  There's not a lot that can
          be done to help us get past the
          pain we've all felt...

He looks at Harry and smiles.

                    LUKE
          ... but I think a good dose of
          magic is as good a place as any to
          start.

The council members MURMUR amongst themselves, then:

                    WYATT
              (eagerly)
          Motion to encourage the citizenry
          of Lawson to help out the Bijou in
          any way they can...

                    DALEY
              (a subtle reminder)
          ... short of the allocation of city
          funds...

                    WYATT
              (agreeing)
          ... short of allocation of city
          funds.

                    DALEY
              (enthusiastically)
          Seconded!

                    ERNIE
              (brightly)
          Motion on the floor, discussion
          open, discussion closed, all those
          in favor signify by saying "aye."

                    ALL
          AYE!

                    ERNIE
          Hearing no opposition, the motion
          is carried!  Congratulations, Luke,
          you got yourself a town to help you
          out!

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - DAY

As the entire city council and the Bijou trio looks on, Luke
moves to the memorial and pulls down the huge piece of muslin
covering it.  Harry steps forward and gathers some of it in
his arms.

Ernie and Daley step forward and look up at the monument.

Ernie touches the names of his two sones inscribed on the
base of the monument.

                    ERNIE
              (slowly)
          You know, this really ought to be
          out where people can see it.

Luke overhears this last, and as he smiles, he turns to
Harry, who brightens as he pulls a large section of the
muslin taut between his outstretched arms...

                                                  CUT TO:

MONTAGE - WITH SOME HARD-DRIVING BOOGIE-WOOGIE UNDER...

ANGLE - THE SCREEN

Harry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old
screen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke
and Adele, who are surrounded by a group of LITTLE KIDS,
watching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe.

Harry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen
drops down on Luke's head.  Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!!  He
raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who
scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

Old Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the
aisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten
carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris.

The men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just
as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to
Harry and grabs his end.  It's Carl Leffert.  A second later,
someone else grabs Old Tim's end.

BOB LEFFERT

has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his
hook.  He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow.

Luke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Harry, Stanton and Mrs. Terwilliger, with the help of Avery
Wyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies
and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls.  Then,
as Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and
Mrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall
paint and brushes.  Immediately, they all set to work
painting.

EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY

Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool
box nearby.  He's just straightened out the "J" and he steps
back... carefully... to admire his handiwork.  For the first
time in a long time, the sign actually reads, "THE BIJOU."

But not for long.  Luke tenses... the building starts
shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.  Luke
lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. 
Once again, the sign reads, " HE B J U."  Luke winces.

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY

Ernie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a
small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it
takes shape in a prominent place in the square...

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

Harry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to
a corner of the muslin.  It snaps into place, and voila --
new screen!  Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge,
standing below, applaud enthusiastically.

INT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY

As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just
finished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover
and trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits,
closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude
No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a
bit out of tune, it's still beautiful.

As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before
long, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. 
Transported.

After a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. 
Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.

                    LUKE
          That was beautiful.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          I taught you that.

                    LUKE
          I can play the piano?

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (all fluttery)
          Oh dear, yes.  You were an
          excellent student, before all that
          clarinet nonsense.  You loved
          Chopin.  You used to call it
          "heaven music."  "Teach me some
          heaven music," you used to say.

She sits at the piano.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Sit.  Play with me.

                    LUKE
          No, I...

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Some of it might come back to you.

Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left.  As she begins to
play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          That's good... that's good...

But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just
plunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures
he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's
transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie
woogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Really, Luke!  That's no way to
          treat Mr. Chopin!

She stands and moves away.  Luke keeps playing, grinning
madly -- he's loving it!  After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs
over and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top
half to Luke's bass line.

OLD TIM

is tapping his foot to the beat.  He turns to Adele and says:

                    OLD TIM
          I taught him that.

Off Adele cracking up.

THE MONTAGE CONTINUES...

EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY

Luke and all the letters up again.  He steps back, checks his
watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train
goes by.  This time, however, only the "J" tips over at a
jaunty angle.  Luke smiles.

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Luke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter,
devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed
potatoes and gravy.  Luke's and Adele's hair is practically
white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are
stained with paint specks.

At the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably
with Bob Leffert.  She smiles at him warmly, then turns to
refill Harry's coffee cup.  Harry thanks her, then turns back
to the newspaper he's reading.

INSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN

Prominent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a
policeman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying
headline:

               BOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S
               JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH

Luke's standing near the sign.  He yells to Adele, down below
on the ground.  She, in turn, yells to Harry, standing near a
switch panel behind the candy counter.  He throws the
switch...

... and the sign lights up beautifully!  Then, they all feel
the rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle
and shake, no letters fall.  A CHEER goes up from Adele,
Harry, and the small crowd of ONLOOKERS below.  Delighted,
Luke takes a formal bow.  The boogie-woogie ends as we

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY

ON THE MEMORIAL

Complete and polished, standing proudly in the center of the
square.

WIDER

It's a clear, balmy day, and the whole town is turned out. 
Mayor Ernie Cole is at the podium.  He finishes his remarks,
then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost
lives of his sons.  He holds them up, high above his head.

ON THE CROWD

One-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly
held aloft by their loved ones.

Luke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out
at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. 
Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform...

LUKE'S POV

It's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in
his dress greens.  He brings his hook-hand up and salutes
smartly.  Mabel takes his good hand, squeezes it as she
blinks back tears.

Luke smiles at this scene as Harry wipes his eyes and puts
his arm around Luke's shoulder, pulls him close and kisses
him on the forehead.

THE SAME - LATER

The Lawson High School Marching Band is set up on the steps
of City Hall, playing the "Star Spangled Banner."  They are
being conducted by their director, MR. PHILLIPS.  Luke and
Harry, hands over their hearts, watch and sing along.  Then,
Luke takes a closer look at the DRUM MAJOR...

ON THE DRUM MAJOR,

a tall young man wearing an ornate brocaded red and white
uniform with "LHS" emblazoned across the chest.

ON LUKE

He has an idea.  The anthem ends, and Luke excuses himself
and moves forward, buttonholing Mr. Phillips as he comes down
the steps...

EXT.  BIJOU - DAY

Luke and Adele are on ladders, hanging letters on the
marquee, which reads:

                 GRAND RE-OPENING TONIGHT!
                         GENE KELLY
                    AN AMERICAN IN PARIS

Harry comes outside and gets their attention.  Grandly, he
gestures toward the door, and out strides

OLD TIM,

wearing his new uniform -- it's the Lawson High School drum
major's uniform, modified here and there.  "B-I-J-O-U" is
proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters.

Luke and Adele applaud.  Old Time looks up at them -- AND
SMILES!

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Old Tim stands at attention, clutching the front door handle. 
Mrs. Terwilliger, wearing a new dress, her hair newly and
perfectly coiffed, stands at the ready at her candy counter,
ready to sell tickets and refreshments.

Harry and Luke nervously pace the lobby.  Luke checks his
watch.  It's time.  He shakes Harry's hand, and nods to Old
Tim, who swings the door open...

ON THE DOOR

Immediately, PATRONS come flooding into the theater.  Luke
exchanges surprised glances with Harry -- then walks outside.

OUTSIDE THE THEATER

Luke comes out and looks down the block.

HIS POV

The line of PATRONS stretches two deep down the block and
around the corner.

Luke smiles.  Success.

THE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- "FRED ASTAIRE - ROYAL WEDDING"

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Luke's selling tickets from behind the candy counter while
Mrs. Terwilliger sells refreshments to a line of CUSTOMERS. 
Luke sells a ticket to a WOMAN, who moves away, revealing

BOB LEFFERT AND MABEL.

Luke smiles at Bob, who smiles back, his eyes now fairly
dancing with life.  He plunks down his admission, and Luke
hands him two tickets, which he takes with his hook-hand. 
Mabel smiles at Luke, takes Bob's good hand, and they move
away, revealing A FARMER AND HIS WIFE, 50s.

The Farmer steps up and holds out a plucked chicken by its
neck.

Luke, surprised, jumps back -- then smiles, pulls off two
tickets, and exchanges them for the chicken.

INT.  BEHIND THE SCREEN - NIGHT

The only light back here is the light of the movie, spilling
through the screen.  Luke is straightening up the backstage
storage area, when Adele taps him on the shoulder.  He turns,
and she throws her arms around his neck and kisses him.  She
hands him a paper to read.

ON THE PAPER

Luke angles it so he can read it by the light of the screen. 
It says:

              California State Bar Association
                    ADELE LOUISE LARDNER
            has PASSED the State Bar examination.

Luke, thrilled, grabs Adele and picks her up, twirling her
around with joy.  He sets her down and kisses her
passionately.

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Harry is frantically threading the changeover projector.  The
bell on the running projector DINGS! once, signalling that
the reel is coming to an end.  Harry looks out the window at
the screen, then back to the task at hand.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster. 
With a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring
how handsome the old place looks.  Old Tim, snappily attired
in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a
dustpan.  Mrs. Terwilliger is straightening up the candy
counter.  All is well.

Luke goes to the lobby's poster case.  He opens it, and
unfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for "SAND PIRATES" --
the same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment. 
Methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the
case.

As Luke passes the auditorium doors, a MAN comes out of the
theater and crosses to the candy counter.  The door stays
open for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch
a bit of the picture.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

ON THE SCREEN - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"

The second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's
programmer.  It's nighttime in the desert.  A huge full moon
hangs over a B-movie soundstage version of the pyramids. 
GREGORY, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is
engaged in a fierce swordfight with KHALID, the villain.

Pete takes a seat on the aisle near the door.

                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
          You don't think you can win this,
          do you?

Khalid lunges and draws Gregory's blood.

                    LUKE
              (ala "Khalid")
          "Ha!  I'd say I was winning!"

                    KHALID (ONSCREEN)
          Ha!  I'd say I was winning!

Luke's look is "How did I know he was gonna say that?"

Onscreen, an EVIL HENCHMAN is sneaking up behind Gregory.

                    LUKE
          "Gregory!  Look out!"

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)
          Gregory!  Look out!

Pete did it again.

Onscreen, Gregory turns and kills the Henchman, then quickly
dispatches Khalid.  He stands over the body, catches his
breath and says:

                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
          It's all right, Rebecca.

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)
          Is he dead?

                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
          Yes, Rebecca.  He's dead.

REBECCA, a beautiful American woman, comes into view and
takes our attention because she's being played by Sandra
Sinclair, Pete Appleton's ex-girlfriend...

ON LUKE

His mouth is gaping open.  He stares at the screen.

                    LUKE
              (a whisper)
          Sandra...?

Luke stands.  Confused, he stumbles backward, moving into the
lobby as the Man goes back into the auditorium with his
popcorn and the door closes.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Luke is staring at the closed auditorium doors.  Old Tim and
Mrs. Terwilliger take note of his odd behavior.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Luke?  Dear, are you all right?

Without answering, Luke turns and runs to the poster case.

ON THE POSTER - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"

Forget the cheesy B-movie artwork.  As Luke looks at the
poster, it's clear that he's remembering something.  He looks
at the picture of Sandra -- then scans down to the credits
block at the bottom of the poster.  His eyes lock upon

                 WRITTEN BY PETER APPLETON

                    LUKE
          My god... my god... no...

Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing
down on him...

... because he remembers...

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

The warning bell DINGS! twice, but the changeover projector's
carbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying.

                    HARRY
              (pleading)
          Oh, baby, make your daddy happy...

Harry's trying to keep the projector going, as the previous
reel is about to end.  Given no other choice, he finally
gives the changeover projector a good swift kick.

It hums to life.  A perfect changeover.  Harry pets the
projector.

                    HARRY
          You're a good girl.  No matter what
          I say.

As he turns away, he feels a sudden, sharp pain in his left
arm.  Wincing, he grabs his arm, staggers back towards a
chair, and sits heavily.

He tries to clear his throat, but it dissolves into a
hacking, choking COUGH.  He tries to stand, but drops to his
knees, clutching his left arm harder than before.

                    HARRY
              (in pain)
          Oh, Jesus...

Harry falls to the floor, and as he does

THE FILM

breaks in the projector gate... flap!  flap!  flap!...

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Luke is still staring at the poster, lost in thought. 
Offscreen, we HEAR the audience WHISTLING AND HOOTING in
reaction to the broken film.

Mrs. Terwilliger has been calling Luke's name, but he doesn't
come out of his stupor until Old Tim comes up behind him and
spins him around...

                    OLD TIM
          Mr. Luke!

Luke stares wide-eyed at the old man.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! 
          The film broke, and I can't raise
          Harry on the house phone!

                    LUKE
              (still dazed)
          What?

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          You've got to talk to them before
          they tear the theater apart!

Finally, Luke pulls himself together, hears the audience
noise, and moves toward the auditorium doors.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Amid the shouting and tossing of popcorn and debris, Luke
tries to regain his composure as he strides down the aisle
toward the stage.

                    LUKE
          Come on, folks, this happens every
          once in a while, just settle
          down...

The crowd quiets down a bit.  Luke shields his eyes from the
light and calls up to the projection booth.

                    LUKE
          Harry!  Harry, why don't you cut
          the projector and bring up the
          house lights?

No reaction.  Just the flickering beam of light.

                    LUKE
          Harry?  Harry...?

Luke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into
the lobby.  The crowd goes silent...

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger watch as Luke tears into the
lobby and makes for the balcony stairs...

INT.  BALCONY - NIGHT

... and charges between the seats and up the stairs to the
projection booth.

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Luke bursts in the sees Harry on the floor.  He rushes over
and kneels down next to him.

          I know, I know... keep still.

A MAN pops his head into the projection booth door.

              (to the man)
          Get Doc Lardner.

INT.  HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Harry is in bed, eyes closed.  Doc Lardner has a stethoscope
to his chest.  He leans up and pats Harry's hand.

He stands and comes over to Luke and Adele, who are near the
door.  Just outside, angling for a view into the room, are
Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger.

                    LARDNER
          It's a pretty massive heart attack. 
          His lungs have filled with fluid,
          and, well... it seems as though his
          body is just... shutting down.

                    LUKE
          Can we get him to the hospital?

                    LARDNER
          Even if we could, and the move
          didn't kill him, there'd be very
          little we could do there that we
          can't do here.
              (puts his hand on Luke's
               shoulder)
          I'm sorry.

Harry's eyelids flutter.

                    HARRY
              (weakly)
          Did you... did you...

Luke rushes to Harry's side and takes his hand.

                    LUKE
          I'm here.

                    HARRY
          Did you... did you...

                    LUKE
          Did I what?

                    HARRY
              (irritated)
          Did you fix the damn film?  It
          broke in the last reel.

                    LUKE
          I know.  Everyone went home.  We
          offered them refunds.

                    HARRY
          Anybody take it?

                    LUKE
          A few.

                    HARRY
              (closes his eyes)
          Vultures...

Luke smiles.

                    HARRY
          I'm not happy about this, mind you,
          but if I have to go, at least I'm
          going in my own bed, the same bed
          my Lily died in, and... knowing
          that my son is alive.  That's not
          too shabby, is it?

                    LUKE
          You're not going anywhere, Harry.

                    HARRY
          Don't tell me, I know about these

          all right.  It's... all right. 
          You're here.  Oh, God, I love you,
          son.

Harry smiles.  Luke kisses his hand and leans up, whispering
in Harry's ear:

                    LUKE
          And I love you... Dad.

Harry smiles faintly, looks at Luke.  He nods, then closes
his eyes.

                    HARRY
              (softly)
          Oh, so... much... lighter...

Slowly, Harry exhales.  His face relaxes, completely at
peace.  He doesn't breathe again.

Luke looks at Harry's face for a moment.  Then as the tears
well up, he leans over and ever-so-gently places a kiss on
Harry's forehead.

EXT.  LAWSON CEMETERY - DAY

It's a beautiful, bright, sunny day.  Luke and Adele stand at
the front of the large group of mourners.  REVEREND COLEMAN,
50s, conducts the service.

                    COLEMAN
          We commit to the earth the mortal
          remains of Harry Bernard Trumbo,
          safe in the knowledge that his
          immortal soul is at peace and at
          last reunited with his beloved
          Lillian in the bosom of the Lord. 
          Let us pray.

Everyone bows their heads.

                    COLEMAN
          "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
          not want, he maketh me to lie down
          in green pastures..."

Luke looks up at the sky, then steps forward and lays a
single rose on Harry's casket.  Then, as everyone
surreptitiously watches, he turns and walks away from the
gravesite, toward the cemetery entrance.

Adele watches Luke depart...

ANOTHER ANGLE

... and she's not alone.  Agents Saunders and Brett are
watching everything from their car, which is parked nearby. 
As Luke walks away, Saunders snaps his photo with a long-lens
camera...

THE BASE OF THE WAR MEMORIAL,

and Luke's name inscribed there.

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DUSK

Luke stands in front of the memorial, head bowed.  After a
moment, he sits, leaning against the memorial.

ON LUKE

Lost in thought, he buries his face in his hands.

                    ADELE'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Mind if I join you?

Luke looks up, squinting.  Adele stands above him, backlit by
the golden light of the sundown.

                    LUKE
          Sure.

She sits next to him.  Tentatively, she touches his shoulder. 
He leans into her, and she enfolds her arm in his.

Pause.

                    LUKE
          Your father said... that I would
          start to remember things.

Suddenly, Adele feels as though she's walking on eggshells.

                    ADELE
              (slowly)
          What... do you remember?

                    LUKE
          Well... everything.  It started
          coming back a couple of days ago. 
          I remember everything now.

                    ADELE
          I see...

                    LUKE
          Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry
          wasn't my father.  And I'm not...
          I'm not Luke.

She closes her eyes.  All her suspicions are suddenly
confirmed.

                    ADELE
              (adrift)
          Oh...

Her tears start, and she moves to hug Luke -- but instead,
she starts hitting him, flailing, beating on his chest.  He
hugs her tightly, and she completely lets go.

                    ADELE
              (crying)
          Oh, god, I knew!  I knew!  I knew
          from the start!  I wanted you to be
          Luke!  I wanted you to be alive! 
          You're so much like him, you have
          no idea.  No wonder everyone else
          accepted you!  You don't know what
          you -- what Luke meant to this
          town, suddenly being alive!  You
          don't know what this town lost! 
          You just don't know...

She pulls away, stands, and looks him in the eye.  Luke
rises.

                    ADELE
              (sobbing uncontrollably)
          I knew you weren't Luke!  And I
          tried not to fall in love with you! 
          And... I don't even know your name! 
          Oh, god...

Luke moves toward her.  She backs away.

                    LUKE
          I fell in love with you, too,
          Delly.  Only now I don't know how I
          feel, about you or about anything. 
          I only think I know how Luke would
          feel.

She's still sobbing.  He moves to her, takes her in his arms.

                    LUKE
          Delly, shhhhhh...

                    ADELE
              (pulling away)
          No... I can't... I have to... I

ON SHERIFF ELDRIDGE,

making short work of a steak and eggs.  As he powers down his
meal, Agents Saunders and Brett, distinctly out-of-place in
their dark suits and hats, enter the diner.  They take note
of Eldridge, and come over.

                    SAUNDERS
          Are you the sheriff?

                    ELDRIDGE
          And I got the uniform to prove it.

                    SAUNDERS
          I'm Special Agent Walter Saunders,
          this is Special Agent Steven Brett,
          FBI.  May we have a word with you?

They flash identification, which Eldridge notes.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (gesturing)
          Please, sit.

They sit across from Eldridge.  As Saunders speaks, Agent
Brett pulls a photo from his coat pocket.

                    SAUNDERS
          A couple of days ago, a county
          flood control maintenance crew
          pulled a car out of the Lawson Wash
          ocean outlet.  They checked its
          registration, and when the owner
          was identified, they notified us.

Agent Brett slides the photo toward Eldridge.

ON THE PHOTO

It's Peter Appleton -- Luke.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (smiling)
          Well, that'd be Luke Trumbo.  Looks
          like you boys've solved a little
          mystery we've had going on for a
          few months.

                    BRETT
          Sir, that's a photo of man named
          Peter Appleton.  He's been missing
          from Los Angeles for close to three
          months now.

                    ELDRIDGE
          What?  No, there's got to be a...

                    SAUNDERS
          Sheriff -- this man is a suspected

Pete sits across from Eldridge, Saunders and Brett.  The
silence in the room is thick.

                    PETE
          Am I under arrest?

Eldridge glances at Agent Saunders, who stares at Pete
impassively.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Well, no, but these gentlemen would
          like to get some answers...

                    PETE
          I don't know what else to tell you. 
          I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head
          and I didn't remember anything
          until a few days ago.

                    SAUNDERS
          Now that you remember who you are,
          were you planning on telling anyone
          your true identity?

                    PETE
          I already have.

                    SAUNDERS
          Who?

                    PETE
          My girlfriend.  If she still is...

                    SAUNDERS
              (checking his notebook)
          Would that be Miss Sinclair?

                    PETE
              (ironic smile)
          No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm
          talking about Adele Lardner.

Agent Saunders glances at Eldridge.

                    ELDRIDGE
          The doctor's daughter.  She was
          Luke Trumbo's sweetheart.

Pause.

                    SAUNDERS
          Mr. Appleton, I have reason to
          believe you're holding something
          back, and that just rubs me the
          wrong way.
              (pause)
          Sir, are you a communist?

                    PETE
              (firmly)
          No.  Absolutely not.

EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

Pete comes out into the bright midday sun.  It takes a moment
for his eyes to adjust, and when they do, he becomes aware of
perhaps TWENTY PEOPLE lining the sidewalk in front of the
station.

PETE'S POV

We recognize several of the people.  Carl Leffert.  Bob
Leffert and Mabel Lanier.  Daley Thornhill.  Katie
Rutherford.  Stanton Lawson.  Now, there's nothing in the
least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's
what's so disturbing about it.  They're not an angry mob,
they're just standing there, running the gamut of emotions.
Shock.  Disillusionment.  Betrayal.

It's an awkward moment.  Pete doesn't quite know how to
react.  He wants to go over and talk to them, but he wouldn't
know what to say.  He wishes one of them would talk to him,
just say something, anything.  But no one does.

Then, Bob Leffert turns away from Pete.  He shoves his hook
hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away, followed by
Mabel, then his brother, then the others...

... leaving Pete alone.

Mrs. Terwilliger, behind the candy counter, wipes up an

Pete anxiously paces the lobby.  He looks into

THE AUDITORIUM.

Every seat is empty.

He glances at his watch, then turns to Old Tim and Mrs.
Terwilliger:

                    PETE
          Let's close up.

As Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim silently shamble off, Pete
goes over and flips OFF several light switches.  Most of the

                    PETE
          Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people
          down in L.A. want a piece of me.

He turns to her.

                    PETE
          This Luke was a pretty good guy,
          wasn't he?

                    ADELE
              (wistful smile)
          Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.

                    PETE
          Well... let me tell you, I'm not
          Luke.  I know who I am now, and you
          don't.  And... I don't like me very
          much.

          You know, it's going to take me a
          while to get used to calling you

              (she takes it for a spin)
          Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.

                    PETE
          Thanks, I like it.  I think.

Pause.

                    PETE
          Delly, I want to do the right
          thing.

Pete can't believe he just said that -- but he did.

                    ADELE
          I believe you.

                    PETE
          The truth is, I'm a lot of things,
          but communist isn't one of them.

                    ADELE
          But if you only went to one
          meeting, why does anyone care? 
          Besides, why should it even matter
          if you were a communist?

                    PETE
          Come on, Delly, look at the country
          today.  We're fighting communists
          in Korea, we're paranoid about the
          Russians, we've got this thing with
          the Rosenbergs and the atomic
          bomb...

          communists" entertaining the
          American public with party
          propaganda like, gosh I don't know,
          "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"

                    ADELE
          Forget about all that.  You want to
          do the right thing?  Then defend
          your name.  If someone says
          something about you that's untrue,
          you have to stand up and say so.  I
          know the law, and the law's on

Pete smiles and puts his arms around her.

There's a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road,
obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away.  It's deadly
quiet as gas station owner RORY, late 60s, pulls up and parks
his Model A truck.  He gets out, and an big old German
Shepherd, LOTTIE, jumps out of the truck bed.

Rory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in the
lock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bank
and sniffing the air expectantly.

                    RORY
          Whatsit, girl?

He stops -- he hears something, too -- a LOW RUMBLE.  Lottie
starts BARKING.  The RUMBLE is getting LOUDER.  Rory's
getting worried.  He looks at

THE FOG BANK.

It's starting to GLOW from within.  Lottie's barking gets
LOUDER and angrier.  Suddenly, a large black car punches out
of the fog bank and tears down the road.  It's followed by
another, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars and
trucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town.

Rory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars fly
past the station.

                    RORY
          Shhhhh.  I know, Lottie.  This

          they have the power to do it.

                    ADELE
          Doesn't it bother anyone that this
          is a perversion of democracy?

Leo turns to her and smiles.  His tone is charmingly matter-
of-factly, not condescending in the least.

                    LEO
          Darling, don't kid yourself.  We
          don't have a "democracy" in this
          country.  The Declaration of
          Independence?  The Constitution? 
          These are pieces of paper with
          signatures on 'em.  And you know
          what a piece of paper with a
          signature is?  It's a contract. 
          And you know what a contract is? 
          Something that can be re-negotiated
          at any time.  It just so happens
          that the House Un-American
          Activities Committee is re-
          negotiating the contract this time
          around.

Leo takes out a cigarette, lights it.

                    LEO
          Next time, it might be the FBI. 
          The time after that, it might be
          the President.  But it'll always be
          someone.  Count on it.

                    PETE
          That's not the country Luke fought
          for.

                    LEO
          Lest we forget, Peter, your own
          military career was somewhat less
          illustrious than Luke's.

                    PETE
          It's wrong, Leo.

                    LEO
          Peter, don't let that stop you all
          of a sudden.

Leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it to
Pete.

                    LEO
          Here.  When you're called, read
          this to them.  Just tell the
          bastards what they want to hear,
          and we can all get on with our
          lives.

There's a knock at the door.  Leo opens it.  Standing there
is a small MAN wearing a serious suit and an even more
serious fedora.

                    THE MAN
          Peter Appleton?

                    PETE
              (standing)
          You found him.

The Man reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a blue
backed folded document, which he hands to Pete.  As he does,
a FLASH lights the room.

At the door, a pair of PHOTOGRAPHERS and a NEWSREEL CAMERAMAN
are jockeying for position.  Pete rolls his eyes.

                    THE MAN
          Peter Appleton, you are hereby
          subpoenaed to appear as a witness
          before a special session of the
          House Committee on Un-American
          Activities.  You are to appear in
          Los Angeles, California, at the
          Biltmore Hotel, at the date and
          time specified herein.

Pete takes the subpoena.  There's an awkward moment, as the
newsreel camera is still rolling.  Pete cradles the subpoena
like an Oscar statuette and smiles into the lens.

                    PETE
              ("on")
          This is a great honor.  I'll
          treasure this always.  Thank you.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PETE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Pete is sitting in a chair, reading the statement Leo gave
him.

                    PETE
              (softly)
          "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby
          renounce my membership in the
          American Communist Party, and by
          way of purging myself of my
          indiscretion, wish to provide the
          following names of fellow members
          to this committee, so that those
          persons may have the opportunity to
          do as I have done..."

He scans down the page.  It's a long list.

                    PETE
          Jesus...

He HEARS a "meow!" And turns to look.

CAT

is standing in the bedroom doorway.  He folds up and pockets
the list.

                    PETE
          Old Tim?

After a moment, Old Tim appears in the doorway, wringing his
knit cap in his hands.

                    OLD TIM
          Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?

                    PETE
          Sure.  Come on in.  I was just
          packing.

Pete stands, gestures Old Tim to the chair, as he sits on the
bed.

                    PETE
          Please, sit.

                    OLD TIM
          Thanks.

He sits.  Pause.

                    OLD TIM
          They'll come back, you know. 
          They'll all c-c-come back.

                    PETE
          The customers?  I don't know...

                    OLD TIM
          They will.  They w-w-will.

Pete turns to Old Tim, fixes him in the eye.

                    PETE
          Tim, I have to tell you something.

                    OLD TIM
          Oh.

                    PETE
          It's about me.

                    OLD TIM
          Oh.

Pause, as Pete gathers courage and tries to find the words.

                    PETE
          I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. 
          He died in the war.  He's not
          coming back, and I'm not him.  I
          don't even belong here.  This whole
          thing started out as an accident,
          and that's all it is.  An accident.

                    OLD TIM
          Oh...

                    PETE
          My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. 
          Peter Appleton.

Old Tim stands and looks askance at Pete.

Pause.

                    OLD TIM
          Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know
          that?

                    PETE
              (taken aback)
          I thought you...

                    OLD TIM
          I know more than you give me c-c-
          credit, that's for sure.  Don't you
          see, it don't m-m-matter who you
          are?  All that matters is what you
          g-g-gave us.  And you can't take
          that away now.  You're wrong, Peter
          Appleton.  You do belong here.

He leans down to Pete.

                    OLD TIM
          You hafta give us back the B-B-
          Bijou.

Old Tim straightens up, nods at Pete.  Then, silently, he
picks up Cat and exits.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - DAY

Pete and Adele walk slowly down the platform toward the
waiting train.

                    ADELE
          You've got everything?

                    PETE
          Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of
          coming out of this intact.

                    ADELE
          You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo
          Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred
          and seventy-five years of American
          law on your side.  Don't forget
          that.

                    PETE
          I wish you were coming with me.

                    ADELE
          And who's gonna run the projector
          until you get back?  Mrs.
          Terwilliger?

                    PETE
          Maybe we could train Cat to run the
          projector.  You know, a system of
          scratching posts, and gears, and
          levers...

They both smile as the train's HORN blows.

                    CONDUCTOR
          Board!

Pete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passenger
compartment.

                    ADELE
          Did you bring along something to
          read?

                    PETE
          Damn...

Adele pulls a pocket-sized leather-bound book out of her
purse and hands it to Pete.

                    ADELE
          I didn't think so.  Here.  This is
          mine, you can borrow it.

INSERT - THE BOOK

Well-worn and scuffed, nevertheless the title is clear:

             CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
                     ANNOTATED EDITION

Pete looks at the book, then at Adele.

                    ADELE
          Not exactly light reading, I know. 
          Believe it or not, I've read this
          since high school, and it got me
          all the way through law school. 
          Besides, there's something in there
          that'll help you.  You won't have
          to get very far, it's near the
          beginning.

                    PETE
              (clearly touched)
          Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll
          take good care of this.

                    ADELE
          Just remember two things.  First,
          the law is a living thing.  It made
          us free and it keeps us free. 
          Sometimes it gets twisted around by
          people for their own purposes. 
          Sometimes it makes mistakes,
          sometimes big mistakes.  But in the
          end, the law prevails for the just. 
          Sometimes, it takes a while.

                    PETE
          Okay.  What's the second thing?

She thinks for a moment.  She needs the right words.

                    ADELE
          I'll be here... if you come back.

The train pulls out.  Adele and Pete exchange waves as we

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

The House Committee on Un-American Activities has effectively
taken over the Grand Ballroom of this magnificent hotel, and
the joint is packed to the rafters.  Members of the AUDIENCE
crane their necks to see out into the hallway, from where the
witnesses will be entering.

The COMMITTEE MEMBERS are seated at their dais, brightly lit
by the dozens of newsreel and TV lights.  Elvin Clyde is
seated at the far right.  Dead center of the dais is the
Chairman, CONGRESSMAN T. JOHNSTON DOYLE of Wisconsin, a
husky man in his late 50s.  He SLAMS his gavel down several
times and the room goes quiet -- the talking stops, and the
cameras start whirring.

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY

Adele's in a chair, eyes glues to the TV set.  Mrs.
Terwilliger and Old Tim sit on the couch, watching
attentively.

Doc Lardner's in a straight-backed chair at a jaunty angle to
the set, holding the rabbit ears uncomfortably high aloft.

                    ADELE
          That's perfect, Dad.

                    DOYLE (ON TV)
          The committee and the chamber will
          come to order.

Lardner forces a smile at Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim.

                    LARDNER
              (sweating and wincing)
          This television's a grand little
          invention, isn't it?

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

                    DOYLE
          The agenda for this morning's
          special session of the House
          Committee on Un-American Activities
          shows a number of witnesses, and
          I'd like to admonish those that are
          here to view the testimony of our
          first witness to keep order at all
          times, or this chamber will be
          closed.  I'm referring especially
          to the ladies and gentlemen of the
          press.  I hope that's clear.

Beat.  Doyle scans the room.  He clearly means business.

                    DOYLE
          Call Peter Appleton.

All eyes and cameras swing toward the door.

ON PETE

As he enters the chamber, dozens of FLASHBULBS fire as every
eye and every camera follows him silently to his seat.  As he
sits, he glances behind him.

PETE'S POV

Leo Kubelsky is sitting in the front row of spectators.  He
smiles and nods at Pete.

Pete doesn't acknowledge him, and turns back.

                    DOYLE
          The witness will please stand and
          raise his right hand.

Pete does as instructed.

                    DOYLE
          Do you swear that the testimony you
          are about to give before this
          committee of the United States
          House of Representatives will be
          the truth, the whole truth, and
          nothing but the truth, so help you
          god?

                    PETE
          I do.

                    DOYLE
          Be seated and state your full name
          and place of residence for the
          record.

                    PETE
          Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood,
          California.

                    DOYLE
          The chair notes that you are
          appearing without the benefit of
          counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We
          certainly hope this means that you
          intend to be fully forthcoming with
          this committee?

                    PETE
              (faint smile)
          I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.

                    DOYLE
          Now, we're informed that you have a
          statement you'd like to read, is
          that correct?

                    PETE
              (innocently)
          A statement?

Doyle and Clyde exchange glances.

                    DOYLE
          Yes.  A prepared statement.

                    PETE
          Um... no.  I don't have a statement
          at this time.

Pete turns in his chair and winks at Leo.  Leo rolls his eyes
and shakes his head.

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY

Adele breathes a sigh of relief.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          I think he's doing very well, so
          far.

                    ADELE
          They haven't called out the dogs
          yet.

                    DOYLE (ON TV)
          Very well then, the questions will
          be asked by the Majority Counsel,
          Mr. Clyde.

The TV shot swings to see Elvin Clyde.  He puts on his
glasses and fixes Pete with an oily grin.

                    ADELE
          I spoke too soon.

                    CLYDE (ON TV)
          Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank
          you Mr. Appleton, for appearing
          today.

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Appleton, you mention that your
          home is Hollywood, California.  But
          isn't it true that for the last
          several months, you've made your
          home in a town called Lawson,
          California?

                    PETE
          Sir, that is true.

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Appleton, do you know an
          "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"

                    PETE
          Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But
          I'd like to think I know him.

                    CLYDE
          Is that because you were
          masquerading as Luke Trumbo while
          you were in Lawson?

                    PETE
          Mr. Clyde you're twisting things
          around.  I wasn't masquerading. 
          Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man
          who gave his life for his country. 
          I just... happen to look a little
          bit like him.  That's all.

                    CLYDE
              (referring to notes)
          Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was
          reported missing in action and is
          presumed dead.  I also see that you
          were posted stateside during the
          war.  Fort Dix?

                    PETE
          Yes, sir.

                    CLYDE
          Well, I'm sure we're all glad to
          see you came through it all right.

A few spectators titter.

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Mabel and Bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packed
diner.

                    CLYDE (ON RADIO)
          Now, I see that you've been running
          a movie theater in Lawson called
          "The Bijou," is that also true?

                    PETE (ON RADIO)
          Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson
          to run The Bijou, that was... that
          was something that just happened. 
          You see, I was involved in an
          accident in Lawson, and I spent
          some time recovering there.

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

Clyde holds up copies of the Los Angeles Examiner and Los
Angeles Times with Pete's picture on the front page.

                    CLYDE
          Anyone who reads the newspaper is
          quite familiar with your...
          "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An
          accident which, conveniently, came
          hard upon your dismissal from
          United Pictures.  Tell us, this
          "accident" of yours, are we given
          to understand that it affected your
          memory?

                    PETE
          Yes.

                    CLYDE
          And what is the state of your
          memory now?

Beat.  Pete smiles.

                    PETE
          I'm sorry, what was the question?

The audience LAUGHS.  Clyde nods at Pete, forces a tight
smile.

                    CLYDE
          We... appreciate... your little
          note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but
          this is a very serious matter, and
          it merits your fullest attention.
              (back to business)
          That state of your memory now, Mr.
          Appleton?

INT.  WYATT'S HARDWARE - DAY

Avery Wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio.  Spencer
comes around the paint aisle, wiping his hands on his apron. 
He moves to the radio and listens solemnly.

                    PETE (ON RADIO)
          Sir, are you referring to the fact
          that I was suffering from amnesia,
          and I've since recovered my memory?

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

                    CLYDE
              (impatient)
          I'm interested in knowing if you
          remember things you did in your
          past, or if they've been
          conveniently "blotted out" as a
          result of your "accident."

                    PETE
              (smiling)
          Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.

                    CLYDE
          Good.  Good.
              (holds up a piece of
               paper)
          Now, I hold in my hand a
          photostatic copy of the attendance
          roster for the "Bread Instead of
          Bullets Club" of the University of
          California, Los Angeles, dated
          October 11, 1935.  A copy of this
          paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. 
          Do you recognize it?

Pete looks on the table and finds the roster.  He's surprised
to see it.

                    PETE
          Yes... yes, I do.

                    CLYDE
          Referring to line thirty-seven of
          the document, does your printed
          name and signature appear there?

                    PETE
          Yes it does.

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Appleton, please tell this
          committee what was the nature and
          purpose of the "Bread Instead of
          Bullets Club?"

                    PETE
          Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what
          I knew then, or do you want to know
          what I know now?  They're two
          different things?

                    CLYDE
          Start with what you knew then.

                    PETE
          Well, I'd direct the attention of
          counsel and committee to line
          thirty-six of the document, and the
          name printed and signed there.

                    CLYDE
          We see it.  For the record, it
          reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's
          the point of this?

                    PETE
          Well, that's what I knew then.  Or
          who I knew, I should say.  You see,
          I was trying to court Miss
          Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to
          impress her.

                    CLYDE
              (grinning)
          Are you asking this committee to
          believe that you attended a meeting
          of a communist party front
          organization in order to impress a
          girl?

                    PETE
              (slyly)
          Well, if you'd seen Miss
          Angstrom...

The audience LAUGHS.  Doyle BANGS his gavel.

                    PETE
          You asked for the truth.  That's
          the truth.  I had no idea what the
          meeting was about.  I just sat
          through it so I could be near her. 
          I'm sure even a Majority Counsel
          like yourself is familiar with the
          concept of impressing a girl.

The audience LAUGHS.  Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who BANGS
his gavel.

                    DOYLE
          Chamber will come to order.

Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete.

                    CLYDE
          All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was
          what you knew then.  What do you
          know now?

                    PETE
              (takes a deep breath)
          Well, I know that I lost my job
          because of one meeting I went to
          when I was a kid in college.  I
          know that I've been branded a
          communist, which I'm not, but even
          if I was, it shouldn't matter, or
          what do we have a Bill Of Rights
          for?

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Chairman, the witness is being
          non-responsive...

A few members of the audience APPLAUD.  As Pete speaks, their
numbers grow.

                    PETE
              (passionately)
          I know that a lot of good, honest,
          decent people, people that I
          consider my true friends, feel
          betrayed by me, not because of who
          and what I am, but because of what
          you say I am!  I know that I...

Doyle BANGS his gavel several times.  Pete stops and the room
falls quiet.

                    DOYLE
              (emphatically)
          Mr. Appleton, you will respond to
          the questions of this committee
          without elaboration or
          speechmaking, or the chair will
          find you in Contempt Of Congress. 
          You will not be warned again, is
          that clear?
              (he lets this sink in,
               then)
          Continue, Mr. Clyde.

                    CLYDE
              (looking down at his desk)
          Mr. Appleton...

Clyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at Pete.

                    CLYDE
          Are you now, or have you ever been,
          a member of the communist party?

                    PETE
          No, sir.

                    CLYDE
              (holding up the roster)
          Are you refuting this evidence and
          your previous testimony?

                    PETE
          I'm not refuting anything.

                    CLYDE
          Yet you're contradicting yourself. 
          You earlier testified that you
          attended a meeting of a communist
          party-run organization, yet you
          just said, under oath, that you
          were not now -- nor ever -- a
          member of the communist party.

                    PETE
          That's not a contradiction at all,
          sir.  I went to the meeting, but I
          didn't go as a member.

                    CLYDE
          Well, then, as what did you go?

Beat.  Pete smiles.

                    PETE
          I'm a little hesitant to say.

                    DOYLE
          The witness need not be hesitant to
          say anything before this committee,
          as long as it's the truth.

Pete shifts in his chair, then leans into the microphone.

                    PETE
          Well, I went as... a horny young
          man.

The chamber erupts in LAUGHTER.  Even the other COMMITTEE
MEMBERS are laughing, except Clyde and Doyle, who BANGS his
gavel vigorously.

INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheriff Eldridge and Daley Thornhill listen to the hearing on
the radio.  They are both laughing at Pete's last comment.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Damn, he don't wanna spar with
          these boys.  They'll eat him alive.

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

The room settles.  Doyle wags his finger accusingly at Pete.

                    DOYLE
              (angry)
          Mr. Appleton, you are making light
          of a legally constituted committee
          of the United States Congress. 
          Believe you me, you do not want to
          incur our wrath.

                    PETE
              (matter-of-factly)
          I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention
          of making light of this committee. 
          And I have no intention of
          incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. 
          I have a few friends who have
          already incurred your wrath. 
          They've sent me letters from jail.

                    CLYDE
              (interrupting)
          Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman, the
          witness is making another speech. 
          I would ask that Mr. Appleton be
          admonished...

                    DOYLE
              (indifferent)
          Mr. Appleton, there is no question
          before you at this time, but I'm
          sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more
          prepared, and if you'd like to
          either answer them or plead the
          Fifth Amendment, we can at least
          get on with the business of this
          committee.

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY

Adele moves to within inches of the TV screen.

                    ADELE
          Tell them Pete.  Tell them...

                    PETE (ON TV)
              (wrestling with this)
          Mr. Chairman, as I understand it,
          the Fifth Amendment pertains to
          self-incrimination, and I can't
          incriminate myself because I've
          done nothing wrong.  Besides,
          incrimination is why you have Mr.
          Clyde working for you.

                    CLYDE (ON TV)
          Mr. Chairman...

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

Clyde is still protesting, but Doyle waves him off.

                    DOYLE
          Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what
          is your intention?

Pete's sweating under the lights.  He's bluffed his last
bluff, and he's on the ropes.  He reaches into his pocket...
and takes out the prepared statement.

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY

                    PETE (ON TV)
          I... Mr. Chairman, I have a
          prepared statement I'd like to
          read...

ADELE

Her hand goes to her mouth.

                    ADELE
          Oh, Pete.  No...

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

                    DOYLE
          Go ahead, Mr. Appleton.

                    PETE
              (slowly reading)
          "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..."

He stops suddenly.  Pause.

                    DOYLE
          Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?

                    PETE
          I... I need a drink of water.

                    DOYLE
          Go ahead, son.

Pete fills a glass from the pitcher.  Nervously, he spills a
bit, and is splashes onto his coat.  As some of the
spectators chuckle, Pete brushes the water off.  He reaches
into his pocket, and pulls out Adele's copy of the
constitution.  The cover is wet.  He wipes it off and sets it
down on the table.

He takes a sip of water.  Looks at the book.  Picks it up.

Pete's terrified, but in control.  He speaks slowly -- he's
making this up and thinking it out as he goes.

                    PETE
          Mr. Chairman... there's... another
          Amendment... that I'd like to
          invoke at this time, but it's not
          the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if
          you're familiar with it.

                    DOYLE
          Mr. Appleton, you will...

He opens the book and reads, tentatively at first.

                    PETE
          "Congress shall make no law
          respecting an establishment of
          religion, or prohibiting the free
          exercise thereof; or abridging the
          freedom of speech, or of the press;
          or the right of the people
          peaceably to assemble, and to
          petition the Government for a
          redress of grievances."

Pause.  Silence in the room.

ADELE

She's smiling at the TV.  Her eyes are filled with tears.

PETE

He looks up at Chairman Doyle.  Now fully confident.

                    PETE
          That's the First Amendment, Mr.
          Chairman.  It's the backbone of
          this nation.  It's everything that
          gives us the potential to be right
          and good and just -- if only we'd
          live up to that potential.  It's
          what gives me the right to sit in
          this chair and say my piece before
          this committee without fear.  It's
          the most important part of the
          contract that every citizen has
          with this country.  And even though
          this contract...
              (he holds up the book)
          ... the Constitution and the Bill
          of Rights -- even though they're
          just pieces of paper with
          signatures on them -- they're the
          only contracts we have that are
          most definitely not subject to
          renegotiation.  Not by you, Mr.
          Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde,
          not by any member of this committee
          -- or anyone else -- ever.

Pin-drop silence in the room.  Pete scans the faces of the
panel.  All betray anger.

ON LEO

He can't help but smile and nod appreciatively.

                    PETE
          And when you get right down to it,
          that's really all I have to say to
          this committee.  Good morning.

And with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared
statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and
walks toward the door.  The cameras swing with him, and
FLASHBULBS fire like machine guns.  Doyle BANGS his gavel
insistently.

                    DOYLE
          The witness will resume his seat! 
          Did you hear me?!  You are not
          excused, Mr. Appleton!

And then, slowly, APPLAUSE builds in the chamber, reaching a
crescendo as Pete reaches the door and exits.

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman...!

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY

As Pete exits the hotel, a DOZEN REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS
have him completely surrounded.  FLASHBULBS pop.  He's taken
aback, flustered.

                    FIRST REPORTER
              (seeing Pete)
          There he is!

                    SECOND REPORTER
          Pete!  Are you going back to
          writing pictures?

                    PETE
          I don't know...

                    THIRD REPORTER
          You a commie, Pete?

                    PETE
          No, of course not...

                    SECOND REPORTER
          What about the girl, Pete?  You
          gonna marry her?  Is she coming to
          Hollywood, or are you...

                    PETE
          Look, fellas, I don't have anything
          to say...

Pete is trapped in the crowd, when he feels a hand on his
shoulder.

LEO

spins him around, and pushes him through the crowd toward the
curb.

                    LEO
          Come on, kid.

At the curb is a black Cadillac limousine.  Leo hauls open
the back door and pushes Pete in, before climbing in himself.

The limo drives away, as the reporters give chase.

INT.  LIMO (MOVING) - DAY

Leo and Pete sit side-by-side in silence for a moment.  Leo
breaks it.

                    LEO
          That was quite a show you gave them
          today.  We shoulda sold tickets.

                    PETE
          I'm not sorry for what I said.

                    LEO
          No, of course not, why should you
          be sorry?  You're the new Peter
          Appleton.  You exercised your
          rights as a solid citizen, first
          amendment, freedom of speech, all
          that.  Very noble.

They sit in silence again for a moment until Leo reaches into
his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he
opens and offers to Pete.

                    LEO
          Cigarette?

                    PETE
          No thanks.

Leo takes one for himself and lights up.  Pete takes off his
hat and nervously scratches his head.

                    LEO
          When'd you quit smoking?

                    PETE
          Luke didn't smoke.

                    LEO
          Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. 
          You're Peter Appleton, the picture
          writer.

                    PETE
              (laughs)
          Not any more.

                    LEO
          Why not?

                    PETE
          Leo, you were in there, you saw
          what I did.  You think they're
          gonna let me write pictures?  Hell,
          they're probably gonna throw my ass
          in jail.

                    LEO
              (with a smile)
          Not at all.

                    PETE
          Besides, I don't even know if I
          want to write anymore.

                    LEO
              (snickering)
          What, you're going to go back to
          that hick town and run the
          projector and marry the doctor's
          daughter?

But before Pete can answer...

                    LEO
          Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches
          and get deals made for guys like
          you.  That's what I do.  You're a
          writer.  You write pictures. 
          That's what you do.  And trust me,
          you'll be back doing it again
          tomorrow morning.

                    PETE
          What do you mean?

                    LEO
          Kid, you gave them what they
          wanted.  This committee, it feeds
          on names.  The more names, the
          better.  But for some high-profile
          witnesses, like yourself, any name
          will do.

                    PETE
          Leo, I didn't give them the names. 
          I wouldn't do that.

                    LEO
          What, all of a sudden, "Lucille
          Angstrom" isn't a name?

Pete freezes.  He slowly turns to Leo.

                    PETE
              (warily)
          Her name was right there in front
          of them.  They gave it to me, I
          didn't give it to them.

                    LEO
          Well, that's not what they think.

                    PETE
          Leo, she was... she was a girl I
          knew in college...

                    LEO
          You should keep track of your old
          school chums.  Turns out she
          eventually joined the communist
          party.
              (takes a puff)
          On top of which, she's Lucy
          Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she
          happens to be a writer for "Studio
          One" on CBS.

                    PETE
              (realization dawning)
          Oh god, oh, god, no, I...

                    LEO
          So, our lawyers had a talk with the
          Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin
          Clyde fella won't be too happy
          about it, but we cut a deal. 
          They cleared you -- and they're
          gonna thank you publicly for your
          testimony purging yourself.

                    PETE
          Thank me publicly?  For what?  For
          ruining this woman's life?

                    LEO
              (dismissive)
          Climb down off your cross.  They
          already knew about her.
              (off his look)
          She was subpoenaed six months ago! 
          Who the hell do you think named
          you?

Pete is dumbstruck.  He slumps in his seat, ashen.

                    LEO
              (he couldn't be happier)
          All of which means... "Ashes To
          Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've
          got your job back.
              (takes a puff)
          Congratulations, kid.

Pete's breathing shallowly, on the verge of tears or
screaming -- or both.

EXT.  PETE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The limo pulls up, and Leo opens the door.  Pete vacantly
grabs his suitcase and gets out.  Leo shuts the door and
calls after him, waving Pete's hat.

                    LEO
          Peter!  Your hat!

Pete comes back and takes his hat.  Leo grabs his hand.

                    LEO
          I was lookin' out for you all the
          time, kid.  You did good.  I'm real
          proud of you.
              (to the driver)
          Okay, let's go.
              (to Pete)
          Get some rest, kid!

As the limo pulls away, we

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY

The door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullen
Pete, carrying his suitcases and hat.  He sets them down and
goes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from
the studio have been gathering dust these last three months.

                    SUPER
              (handing him a key)
          Here's a new key for ya.  That Mr.
          Kubelsky, he's got you paid up
          through this month.  You got one
          swell friend there.

The Super moves to the door and turns back.

                    SUPER
          Good to have you back, Pete.

He exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out
the tin-toy fire truck.  Distractedly, Pete puts the toy back
in the box and replies too late:

                    PETE
          Thanks...

He sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat.  As he
does, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat
pocket and falls open to the floor.

Pete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the
inscription inside the front cover catches his eye:

                         TO DELLY,
               THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS.
                         LOVE, LUKE

Pete closes the book.  He thinks for a moment, then glances
over at the phone.  He picks it up and dials "0."

                    PETE
          Western Union, please.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY

Our view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds up
the spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara.  Looking
into one of the train's windows, we SEE Pete sitting, staring
out at the passing scenery.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Dear Adele, on my way back to
          Lawson STOP.  That is, if they'll
          have me STOP.  Train arrives four
          p.m. STOP.  Hope you can be there
          STOP.  Pete.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON

The train is just pulling in to Lawson.  As it SHUDDERS to a
halt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete
steps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open...

HIS POV

The ENTIRE TOWN has turned out.  They're all there, smiling
broadly.  A large, hand-lettered banner reads:

                     WELCOME HOME PETE!
                   LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON

A CHEER goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence.  Pete
descends from the train and moves into the throng.  The first
two people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier. 
bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smiling
as they shake hands vigorously.

                    BOB
          Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it
          weren't for you, I wouldn't have
          had the nerve to ask this fine
          woman to marry me.

Mabel's mouth drops open.

                    PETE
          Bob, congratulations!  When'd you
          ask her?

                    MABEL
          Holy moley!  Just now!
              (to Bob)
          Yes, Bob!  Yes!

As Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues into
the crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back.

ADELE

is at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front. 
She rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss.  Another CHEER
goes up.

                    PETE
          I see you got the telegram.

                    ADELE
          Pete, I'm so sorry about what they
          did to you.  I didn't think you'd
          come back, I thought you'd want to
          write again...

                    PETE
          Dell, I can't write unless I'm
          happy, and I can't be happy unless
          I'm here -- and with you.
              (grabs her shoulders)
          This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. 
          And I love you!

                    ADELE
              (tears in her eyes)
          And (hic!) I love you, Pete!

They kiss again.  Pete pulls away and looks at his watch.

                    PETE
              (smiling)
          C'mon, Dell, we gotta go.  Showtime
          in fifteen minutes.

The train whistle BLOWS as it slowly pulls out of the
station.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          "Happily ever after" is a relative
          term, folks.  My world is much
          smaller now, and my dreams are very
          different than they were.  But I
          have something now that I never had
          before: I have the magic.  And
          it's for sale at the Bijou, every
          day of the year.  All you need is
          the price of a ticket.

We BOOM UP to see Pete and Adele moving into and being
enveloped by the crowd.

Spencer Wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot
office, and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as we
move up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over the
town, settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijou's
marquee.  The neon chaser lights POP ON, illuminating the
sign, which reads:

                          THE END

Then, the letters on the marquee START SHAKING.  We BOOM UP
TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...

... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...

... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...

... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND...

                                            CUT TO BLACK.
THE BIJOU

                                             REVISED DRAFT

                                             October 14, 1997





                           "... the magic is all around you.
                                  All the time.  Everywhere.
                                             In every thing.
                                 The trick... is to see it."



IN BLACK...

... the insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat of
BOOGIE-WOOGIE.  Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up.

THEN...

... in the blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumbling
g-e-n-t-l-y, a picture-postcard:

                "GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!"

Then another... and another, each one dropping through frame,
a gentle rain.

In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie
stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and-
footprints in the wet cement.

Another postcard:

        "I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!"

In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and
Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at
the Brown Derby.  Or Ciro's.  Or the Coconut Grove...

More postcards.  Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones
that you and I know today.  These are palaces.  Temples. 
Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian.  The Carthay Circle.  The
Paramount, the Million Dollar.  From a time when moviegoing
was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall.  The
ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded
jackets and guided you to your seat.  The popcorn was hot and
fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil.

                                                  CUT TO:

THE PILE OF POSTCARDS

a wild jumble.  Then, one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on top
of the pile.  It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet of
lights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt. Lee's most
famous resident, the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN.  We PUSH INTO
THE PICTURE OF THE SIGN, DISSOLVING UNTIL WE'RE...

... PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer and closer,
until we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up and
behind it until we're looking down at...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT

SUPER TITLE: 1951

A gigantic aerial shot.  Postwar autos fill the muggy
midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING
HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.  Darkened
outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home
construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being
built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town,
a swath of garishly bright concrete called

HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Of course, it's not like the
          postcards say it is.  This is what
          it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and
          this is my town.

Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the
intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the
boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and
Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian
Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across
Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the
street to

GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Born and raised here, thank you
          very much.  Sometimes, it seems
          like everyone here is from
          somewhere else.  But everyone loves
          the movies, so Hollywood is
          everyone's town, and they come here
          by the busload.  To them, Grauman's
          Chinese Theater is just about the
          most exciting place on the planet. 
          To me, it's the theater that's
          playing "The African Queen."

And like the man said, the film on the marquee is "THE
AFRICAN QUEEN."  Still the same shot, buses disgorge
TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.  The
MEN doff their hats and mop their brows.  The WOMEN pull
their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with
movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. 
We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay
behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on
their way to

THE THEATER ENTRANCE,

where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their
tickets.

                    DOORMAN
          Newsreel's just starting, folks.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          That's me and my girlfriend.  Her
          name is Sandra Sinclair, and this
          is her town, too -- she's from
          Cleveland.  She came out here to be
          an actress, and that's just what
          she's doing.  The first picture I
          ever wrote, a little potboiler
          called "Sand Pirates of the
          Sahara."  Okay, it ain't "Citizen
          Kane," but you gotta start
          somewhere.

MOVING INTO THE LOBBY

an explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. 
Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting
and golden light.  We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the
same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the
auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect
USHERS and we move into

THE DARKENED THEATER.

As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the
soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the
unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the
same shot -- we see the screen...

A NEWSREEL.

As the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL
ANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE:

                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
          Bringing the news of the world to
          you!

Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee
Hearing Room, a title blares "HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!"

                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
          Four years ago, in one of
          filmland's darkest hours, ten men,
          the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were
          called to testify before the House
          Committee of Un-American
          Activities, investigating the
          proliferation of the dreaded Red
          Menace in Hollywood.

We see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal
battles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. 
JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE.

                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
          Refusing to answer the lawmaker's
          questions, cowering behind the
          Fifth Amendment's protection
          against self-incrimination, the ten
          motion picture writers dared
          Congress to come after them.  Well,
          come after them they did!  And
          after years of court wrangling,
          it's now time to pay the piper!

Over shots of several of the "Hollywood Ten" being led to
jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues.

                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
          And so, it's off to jail, the
          charge: Contempt of Congress!  This
          should give you fellas something to
          write about now!  A new round of
          investigations begins this fall,
          the mandate: Get the reds out of
          Hollywood!

In the audience, one man YELLS "Lock up the commie
bastards!," and a few others cheer and laugh.  As the
newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we
WHEEL AROUND AND...

ENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR.

Pete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and Sandra's a starlet
pretty girl in her mid-20s.  As she rummages in her purse,
Pete watches the newsreel.

                    SANDRA
          Pete, there's time before the
          picture starts, you want to get
          some popcorn?

                    PETE
          You bet, honey.

Pete kisses Sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints up
the aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin on
his face.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          We were young, we were in love, and
          we were working in pictures. 
          Life... was good.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - MAIN GATE - MORNING

Pete pulls up to the guard kiosk in his spiffy yellow
convertible Plymouth.  The Guard, RAY, steps out to meet him. 
Pete lights up a cigarette.  We get a better sense of him
now.  Though earnest, he's jocular, and a bit of a fast
talker.

                    PETE
              (very chipper)
          Mornin', Ray.  Whaddya know whaddya
          say?  Me and Sandra caught "The
          African Queen" at the Chinese last
          night.  Great picture, great
          picture.

Ray is nonplussed.  Tips his hat.  Regards Pete suspiciously.

                    RAY
          Mr. Appleton.

                    PETE
          What's with this "Mr. Appleton"
          crap?  Your boss hiding in there?

                    RAY
          You're clear to go in.

                    PETE
          What's that mean?

Ray heads back to his kiosk, shaking his head.

                    RAY
          Have a pleasant day.

Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.

EXT.  UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - WRITER'S BUILDING - MORNING

Pete pulls up, hops out, grinds out his cigarette, looks
around and goes inside.

INT.  WRITER'S BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNING

Pete comes down the hall a few steps, stops.  Something's
wrong.  It's awfully quiet.  He pokes his head into the door
marked "TYPING POOL."

INT.  TYPING POOL - MORNING

A sea of black Underwoods -- all silent.  The lights in the
room are off, and hard shafts of morning sun stream in
through the windows.  One typists, LOUISE, is going from
machine to machine, pulling covers over them.

                    PETE
          Louise... what gives?

She looks up, startled.

                    LOUISE
          Oh Pete... they, uh, they gave
          everybody the day off... while they
          sort things out.

                    PETE
          Sort what out?  Are my pages done?

                    LOUISE
          They took 'em.

                    PETE
          They took 'em?  Who took 'em? 
          Louise, what's going on...

                    LOUISE
          Pete, I'm not even supposed to be
          talking to you...

She rushes past him.  Pete doesn't quite know what to think.

                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Good morning, Peter.

Pete turns.  The voice belongs to Pete's agent, LEO KUBELSKY,
a rotund man in his fifties.  He wears a perfectly tailored
silk suit.

                    PETE
          Leo... what's going on?

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STUDIO STREET - DAY

FROM FAR AWAY, we watch as Leo and Pete come out of the
Writer's Building and join a flood of DRESS EXTRAS, all done
up in Puritan pilgrim garb and heading for the commissary.

As they move through the mob and emerge on the other side,
it's clear that Pete is reeling from something he's just been
told.

PETE AND LEO

                    LEO
          Peter, their hands are tied.  You
          see that, don't you?

                    PETE
          I... I don't believe this.

                    LEO
          Are you saying it's a mistake, that
          you didn't go to any meetings? 
          They say you did.

                    PETE
          Who the hell is this "they?"

                    LEO
          Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it
          don't matter who the hell "they"
          is.  "They" know who "they" are,
          that's all that matters.
              (deliberately)
          Now, did you go to any meetings?

                    PETE
              (on the spot)
          No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. 
          Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before
          Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. 
          It was a bunch of kids, and I was
          just one of 'em.  I didn't believe
          in what they were saying.  Hell, I
          didn't even know what they were
          saying!

                    LEO
          So, you're saying that it's true. 
          You went to a meeting of a known
          communist organization.

                    PETE
          Leo, I was trying to impress a
          skirt.  You know me, I'm non-
          political.  Republican, Democrat,
          Communist, there's not a dime's
          worth of difference between 'em
          anyway.

                    LEO
          You should watch what you say.

                    PETE
          I don't know who fingered me, but
          I'm not a communist!

                    LEO
          Kid, that cuts no ice with them.

                    PETE
              (frustrated)
          What?  That I'm accused of being a
          communist when I don't happen to be
          one?

                    LEO
          They know you were at that meeting,
          Peter.  They've been told, and they
          know.

                    PETE
          Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them"
          to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do
          anything wrong.  I fought in the
          war, for crissakes!

                    LEO
          Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the
          PX at Fort Dix.

                    PETE
          I was decorated.

                    LEO
          I know.  A Purple Heart.

                    PETE
          Exactly.

                    LEO
          You broke your arm.  You were
          coming out of a bar.  You were
          drunk.

                    PETE
          At least I was on our side!  Look,
          they want me to testify?  I'll
          testify.  I'll tell 'em anything
          they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo,
          this is my career!

                    LEO
          You can't testify.

                    PETE
          Why not?

Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket,
offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself.

                    LEO
          Don't take this personally, kid. 
          If it were up to me, I'd have you
          testify wearing your uniform and
          your medal, wrapped in a flag with
          one hand on your heart and the
          other hand on a bible.  What can I
          say?  I like you.

Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own.  Puts a fatherly
hand on his shoulder.

                    LEO
          They don't want you to testify
          because you're not a big enough
          fish for them.  They just don't
          want you writing pictures for now. 
          That's all.

                    PETE
              (under his breath)
          Yeah, well, that's enough.

                    LEO
          Peter, I believe in you.  More to
          the point, I read your new
          script... um...

                    PETE
          "Ashes To Ashes?"

                    LEO
          That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." 
          I think it's great.  But it'll
          never get made with this communist
          business hanging over your head. 
          You can't work until you're cleared
          -- and believe me, starting right
          now, I'm gonna do everything I can
          to make that happen.

                    PETE
          So, it is a blacklist.

                    LEO
              (defensive)
          Don't say that.  There is no such
          thing as a blacklist.
              (calm)
          Now, are you gonna play ball?

                    PETE
              (sullenly)
          Yes.
              (then, pissed)
          Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!

Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke.

                    LEO
              (hand on Pete's shoulder)
          Kid, this is the United States
          Government we're talkin' about. 
          Fair ain't the point.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAY

Prominent on the wall is a framed "SAND PIRATES OF THE
SAHARA" poster.  Pete reaches up and takes it down.  He leans
it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden
swivel chair.  He swivels around to see

A STUDIO SECURITY GUARD

standing by the door.  He's watching Pete's every move.

Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's
belongings.  Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk
drawer.  He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the
desk.  He looks at the cover of the first one:

                "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"
                     By Peter Appleton
                A United Pictures Production
                     February 19, 1951

Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the
second one:

                      "ASHES TO ASHES"
                     By Peter Appleton

He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box,
which contains somewhat more personal items.  A ragged gold
pillow with tassels.  Legal pads of notes.  An old tin-toy
fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn.  He turns
it around in his hands.

                    PETE
              (musing)
          Huh.  Red...

Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door.

                    SANDRA (O.S.)
          Pete?  Pete...?

Sandra appears in the doorway.  She's in costume -- a Louis
XIV courtier.  She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and
embraces him.

                    SANDRA
          Oh, Pete...

They kiss.  The Guard watches their every move.

                    SANDRA
          What happened?

                    PETE
          What exactly did you hear?

                    SANDRA
          That you got let go.

                    PETE
          I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie
          Ruskin directing the picture you're
          in?

                    SANDRA
          He was, but he got sick.  We got a
          new director today.  Why?

                    PETE
          Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's
          catching.

                    SANDRA
          You mean, he was... let go, too?

                    PETE
              (sotto, an appeal)
          They're saying I'm a communist,
          Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. 
          I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna
          win, but I'll need your help.

During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling
away from Pete.

                    PETE
          A lot of good people are being
          accused of things they didn't do. 
          Hell, even if I was a communist,
          this is America, goddammit, a
          person should be able to be
          whatever they want to be!  Right?

Sandra glances at the Guard, who is watching everything.

                    SANDRA
              (nervously)
          Of course, but I... I don't know
          how I... how much help I can be to
          you.  This is the sort of thing...
          someone saying you're a
          communist... it can ruin your
          career.

Pete sees where this is going.  She's edging toward the door.

                    PETE
          Will you help me, Sandy?

                    SANDRA
          I'll have to think about this.  I
          have to get back... I should go...

And she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye.  Pete
looks at the Guard.

                    PETE
          So nice to be a pariah.

The Guard turns away.  Pete moves back toward the boxes. 
Rummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels
with barely one swig left.  He regards the bottle for a
moment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't),
pops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it.  He looks
at it thoughtfully as we

                                                  CUT TO:

A HALF-FULL BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS setting down on a bartop.

WIDER

INT.  THE FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT

The bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietly
getting stewed.  The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive,
dimly lit and full of character and characters.  It's a quiet
night and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are just
leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s. 
Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of
the bar.  Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. 
Good boy, he got most of it in the glass.

                    JERRY
          Pete.  You think maybe you've had
          enough?

                    PETE
          Bought the bottle, didn't I?
              (raises the shot)
          To the United States of America. 
          Long my she wave.

He knocks it back and Jerry pours him another.

                    PETE
              (trying to light a smoke)
          Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.

                    JERRY
          What.

                    PETE
          You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

                    JERRY
              (helps Pete light his
               cigarette)
          The G-man?

                    PETE
              (thickly)
          Zackly.

                    JERRY
          Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in
          here wearing a dress, I wouldn't
          know him.

                    PETE
          Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.

                    JERRY
              (glancing around)
          You should watch what you say.  You
          don't know who's listening.

                    PETE
          You know I'm not a communist, don't
          you, Jer?

                    JERRY
          Sure, I suppose.  That why you're
          on a bender?

                    PETE
          This is not a bender yet.  This is
          the start of a bender.  But I can
          see how you were confused, they
          look a lot alike.

Pete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar.  He
watches Jerry, who is not about to refill it.  Pete reaches
for the bottle, but Jerry is faster.  

                    JERRY
          Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll
          call that girlfriend of yours,
          what's her name... Sandy?

                    PETE
              (laughs)
          Sandra Sinclair.

                    JERRY
          Gimmee her number, I'll have her
          pick you up.

                    PETE
          Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her
          real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No
          one's who they really are, Jer. 
          Everyone's someone else.  Even you. 
          Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter
          Appleton, the communist who's not
          really a communist.

                    JERRY
          I wanna close up soon.  C'mon,
          let's call her.

Peter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled bills
on the bar and grabs his hat.

                    PETE
          Nope.  Can't.  We're through.

                    JERRY
          Then I'll call you a cab.

                    PETE
          I'll save you the trouble.
              (beat)
          I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.

Pete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his
car keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in his
condition.

                    PETE
          'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll
          be seein' ya, Jer.

                    JERRY
          Pete...

And he's out the door.

EXT.  FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT

Pete takes a few steps, stumbles, stops, takes a deep breath,
then totters briskly towards his car.  He hauls the door open
and sits inside heavily.

INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR - NIGHT

Sitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as
though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably
be a good idea.

                    PETE
              (mumbling)
          Drive.  Drive.  Bad idea.  Too
          drunk to drive.

He looks at his watch.

                    PETE
          One-thirty.  Huh!  Early.  Can't go
          home yet.

He turns the key and hits the starter.  The engine hums to
life.  Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze
and puts the car in gear.

The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt
and stalls.

                    PETE
          Oops.

He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and
down the deserted boulevard.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT

The full moon is low over the ocean.  Pete's car is parked at
the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away.  The ferris
wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark
and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight.  Pete is asleep
in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his
face, snoring.

The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake.

                    PETE
          Huh?  Whatsa...

Instantly, he grabs his head.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          I had no idea how I got to Santa
          Monica, but it certainly was a good
          idea.  I don't think I could've
          faced the headache I had alone in
          my apartment.  At least I had the
          ocean air.

Pete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing.  He gets out
his cigarettes and lights up.  He takes a puff and glances at
his watch.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Three forty-five.  I had only been
          there for a couple of hours at
          most.  Truth be told, I was still
          fairly drunk.

He starts the car and heads for the highway.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          I'd head north until the sun came
          up or I ran out of gas, whichever
          came first.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Pete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop.  Waves crash
to the shore below the roadway.

INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Pete is finally relaxed.  He takes off his hat and jams it
down in the back seat.  He takes a deep breath -- with the
wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at
peace.  He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the
fuel gauge.

INSERT - FUEL GAUGE

Pinning on "empty."

                    PETE
          Shit.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Guess which came first.

He scans the road ahead -- nothing.  Glances to his right.

PETE'S POV

The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance.

Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that
will take him toward the lights.  He passes a hand-painted
sign that gives him hope: "GAS - 1 MI."

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  RORY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT

Pete's car rolls up and stops.  There's a light on the sign
and another in the station's window, but the place is
deserted.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          I should've known better than to
          think that a service station in the
          sticks would be open at this hour,
          but it wasn't like I had a lot of
          choices.

Pete looks ahead toward the town.  Its few lights twinkle in
the distance.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          What the hell.  At least there'd be
          a diner opening in a couple of
          hours.  I'd get some pie and
          coffee, and then I could worry
          about the gas.

Pete pulls out onto the road.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT

Pete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted
roadside sign which reads:

                           SLOW!
         NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL
                        USE CAUTION!

INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Pete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading
"LAWSON WASH," just in front of a small wooden auto bridge.

Barely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge...

HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

... his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless
possum...

Pete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the
edge...

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

... and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and
into the rapidly-moving water below!

EXT.  UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The water is flowing very quickly, and the current is
intense.  Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat
(thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the
windshield.

But... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle.  Nearly
out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and
heads for the surface.

EXT.  THE WASH - NIGHT

Pete breaks the surface and gasps for air.  His fight isn't
over yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream. 
He swims with all his might toward the far bank.

EXT.  FAR BANK OF THE WASH - NIGHT

Drained, Pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to
his feet.

                    PETE
              (gasping)
          Oh my god!  I don't believe... oh
          my god...

He stumbles along backwards a couple of steps... and his heel
hits a rock...

Pete falls backward -- and his head strikes a glancing blow
on another rock.  He rolls down the bank, unconscious, and
lands face down in the mud.

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

IN BLACK, we slowly become aware of a panting, breathing
sound -- the sound of a dog...

FADE IN:

ON A DOG'S FACE

A yellow labrador, full frame.  It takes a couple more
sniffs, then starts licking furiously.

                    OLD MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Maggie, whatcha got there?  Huh,
          girl?  Whatcha find?

EXT.  FAR BANK OF THE WASH - DAWN

Pete is still laying face down on the bank, being fervently
licked in the face by the dog.

ON THE OLD MAN

A no-nonsense sort in his late-60s, he wears overalls and an
old railroad cap.  He comes down to Pete, and using his
walking stick, pokes him in the side.

                    OLD MAN
          Mister, who are ya?  my dog likes
          you, but that don't mean much, she
          likes skunks, too.  Sweet n'stupid,
          that's why I keep her.

Pete blinks up at the Old Man, his mouth gaping open.

                    OLD MAN
          Mister, you okay?  You look wet. 
          You in an accident or somethin'?

                    PETE
          I... I don't know.

He sits up, and the Old Man gets a look at his head, which is
caked with mud and blood on one side.

                    OLD MAN
          You best come with me.  Can ya
          walk?

                    PETE
          I... yes, I think so.

He stands up shakily.  The Old Man gives Pete a hand.

                    OLD MAN
          Come on, we'll have the Doc look
          you over.

                    PETE
          My head hurts.

                    OLD MAN
          I shouldn't be surprises.  You
          smell like that was quite a night
          before you had there.
              (to the dog)
          Maggie!  Let's go now!

And they head toward the road to town.  BOOMING UP, we SEE
them pass a roadside sign:

ON THE SIGN:

                         WELCOME TO
                     LAWSON, CALIFORNIA
                         EST. 1869
                   ELEV. 275    POP. 1755
                          THE TOWN
                     THAT GAVE ITS ALL

                    OLD MAN (STANTON)
          Name's Stanton Lawson.  My
          ancestors founded this town.

                    PETE
          Ancestors?

                    STANTON
          Actually, my grandpap.  But
          "ancestors" sounds better, don't
          it?
              (hands Pete a
               handkerchief)
          Here.

Pete takes the handkerchief and wipes the mud and some of the
blood off his face.

                    PETE
          I suppose.  Thanks.

                    STANTON
          You look familiar, fella.  What's
          your name?

Pete stops, thinks for a moment.

                    PETE
          I'm... I... I honestly don't know.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - LAWSON, CALIFORNIA - DAY

Pete and Stanton walk along Commerce Street, the main drag
through the center of the small town.  Lawson is a bit run
down, creeping inexorably toward decrepit.  Despite that,
there's a timeless quality to the small buildings, a familiar
All-American feel.

Several of the PEOPLE walking along the street take notice of
Pete and nod to Stanton, who nods back.

                    PETE
          They all know you?

                    STANTON
          'Course they all know me.  And I
          know all them.  Town's got my name,
          don't it?

They pass the window of the drug store, COLE'S PHARMACY. 
Pete looks down and sees

TWO FADED GOLD STARS

in the window with two faded photos, all decked in tattered
black crepe.  Two boys, no more than 18 and 19, who went off
to war and didn't come back.

Stanton notes Pete stopping to look at the stars and photos.

                    STANTON
          Ernie Cole here just got himself
          elected mayor.  Lost both his boys
          in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and
          Willie at Normandy.

                    PETE
              (thinking)
          The war...

                    STANTON
              (points across the street)
          Mabel over there at the diner lost
          her husband Max.  Okinawa, I
          believe.

ANGLE - MABEL'S DINER

A typical small-town greasy spoon -- with one faded star
prominent in the window.

CLOSER

On MABEL LANIER, a sweet-faced woman in her 30s.  She stares
vacantly into space, her reverie broken by a customer needing
a coffee refill.

                    STANTON
          All told, this little town gave
          sixty-two of its finest to the war. 
          Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone. 
          More'n its share, I should say. 
          Got us a letter from President
          Truman.  City council commissioned
          a war memorial.  Been sittin' in
          the basement of city hall these six
          years.  Town never had the heart to
          put it up.  Place just hasn't been
          the same since the war.

STANTON AND PETE

Pete looks longingly toward the diner.  Stanton takes note.

                    STANTON
          You hungry, son?

                    PETE
          Yes.  Very.

                    STANTON
          Got any money?

Pete rummages in his pants pockets, and comes up with three
quarters.

                    STANTON
          Six bits.  More'n enough to buy
          some breakfast.  C'mon.

And they head across the street.

                                                  CUT TO:

A PLATE WITH TWO PIECES OF APPLE PIE

A fork comes into frame and tears into one of the slices.

WIDER

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Pete is fairly shoveling the pie into his mouth, pausing only
to wash it down with gulps of coffee.

MABEL

stands nearby, watching in amazement as her pie is consumed
in record time.

Pete notices that Stanton and Mabel -- and the other PATRONS,
for that matter -- are watching his feeding frenzy.  He stops
in his tracks, and starts chewing leisurely.  He smiles at
Mabel.

                    PETE
              (mouth full)
          Pie's... good.

                    MABEL
              (wryly)
          Like you could tell.
              (to Stanton)
          Where'd you find him?

                    STANTON
          Down by the wash.

                    MABEL
          We gotta put a rail on that thing
          before someone else gets killed.
              (to Pete)
          Three people have died there,
          Mister.  You're lucky to be alive.

                    PETE
              (draining the coffee cup)
          Thanks.  More coffee?

Mabel obliges.  As she pours the coffee, she looks at Pete.

                    MABEL
          You know, you look familiar.  You
          ever been in here before?

Pete shakes his head.

                    STANTON
          He don't remember who he is, Mabel. 
          Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon
          as he gets in.

                    MABEL
              (distractedly)
          Doc should be in for his coffee and
          bear claw any minute...
              (to Pete)
          You sure you never been in here?

Pete looks up at Mabel and smiles winningly.

                    PETE
          I'd remember this pie.

Mabel, thoroughly charmed, smiles back at Pete.

                    MABEL
              (patting his hand)
          I'll just get you another piece.

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - DAY

A stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, HARRY TRUMBO
shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner.  There's
a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man
who has little to smile about because he has little to care
about.  After a couple of steps, he's met up by DOC BEN
LARDNER, a vigorous man in his 50s.  He comes up behind Harry
and claps him on the back.

                    LARDNER
          'Mornin' Harry.  Fine day, isn't
          it?

                    HARRY
          Morning, Doc.  Yes, yes it looks
          just fine.

                    LARDNER
          Plenty to do today?

                    HARRY
              (vaguely)
          Oh, yes, plenty.  Plenty.

They're at the door of the diner.  Doc opens it for Harry.

                    LARDNER
          After you.

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Lardner comes over to Mabel, who hands him a tall paper cup
of coffee and bags him a bear claw.

                    LARDNER
          Mornin' Mabel, Stan.

                    MABEL
          Mornin' Doc.  Got some new business
          for you today.

Lardner and Pete make eye contact, and the doctor notices the
bump on his head.

                    LARDNER
          Hello, son.  How'd that happen?

                    STANTON
          He don't know.  And he don't know
          his name, neither.  Found him down
          by the wash.

                    LARDNER
          You'd better come with me, son.
              (to Mabel, indicating the
               coffee and danish)
          On my tab?

                    MABEL
          You bet.

Lardner, Stanton and Pete rise and move to the door.  Pete
turns back, takes the three quarters out of his pocket, and
puts them on the counter, smiling brightly at Mabel.

                    PETE
          Thanks.  Great pie.

                    MABEL
              (blushing)
          You're welcome.  Come again.

ON HARRY

seated at the opposite end of the counter.  He glances up at
Pete.

His mouth falls open, his hand moves to cover it.  He's just
seen a ghost...

          eyes.  That's it.  Good.

WIDER

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Doc Lardner is checking Pete's eyes.  Pete sits on an
examination table, his shirt off, his head freshly bandaged. 
Stanton lurks in the corner, Maggie curled at his feet.

                    STANTON
          He was passed out cold.  Maggie
          woke 'im.

                    LARDNER
          Uh-huh.  He looks familiar.
              (to Pete)
          Open your mouth.  Say "ah."

Pete does.  Lardner has a look as Stanton pulls out a pocket
watch.

                    STANTON
          Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't
          place him, though.  To look at him,
          you'd think the cheese slid off his
          cracker.
              (looks at his watch)
          Well, morning's half-over.  I'm
          off.

                    PETE
          Thank you, Mr. Lawson.

                    STANTON
          Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.

Stanton and Maggie exit.  Lardner checks Pete's ears.

                    LARDNER
          Any idea how you got here, son?

                    PETE
          No, sir.

Lardner sniffs him.

                    LARDNER
          Been drinkin' a bit, have we?

                    PETE
          I don't remember.  I guess so. 
          Smells like it.
              (smacks his lips and
               frowns)
          Tastes like it.

                    LARDNER
          Well, you've been wet to the skin. 
          You must've fallen in.

                    PETE
          I guess I did.

                    LARDNER
          Lucky you got out, that water's got
          quite a pull, and it empties
          straight into the ocean.

Lardner takes a shirt off his counter and hands it to Pete.

                    LARDNER
          Here, one of mine.

                    PETE
          Thanks.

Pete puts on the shirt.

                    LARDNER
          Do you remember if you were driving
          a car?  Maybe you went over the
          bridge.  No guard rail there, it's
          easy to do.  It's happened before.

                    PETE
          It's possible.  I just don't
          remember.

                    LARDNER
          And you don't know your name or who
          you are, that right?

                    PETE
              (frustrated)
          I... no, I... I just can't...

                    LARDNER
              (gently)
          It's okay, son.  We just need to
          call you something.  That's all.

Pete stifles a laugh.

                    LARDNER
          What is it?

                    PETE
          Call me... Ishmael?

                    LARDNER
          Well, at least you remember "Moby
          Dick."

Lardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling his
bear claw.  Pete is standing, nosing around the office --
diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks.  He zeros in on one
photo in particular.

ON THE PHOTO

one of Lardner and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.  They've been
fishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catch
than Lardner.

                    LARDNER
              (into phone)
          Stanton found him by the wash.  Not
          hurt too bad, but he took a nasty
          bump on the head and he can't
          remember who he is.  We both think
          he looks familiar, but we can't
          place him.  You bet.  He'll be
          here.

Lardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures.

                    LARDNER
          That's me and my daughter Adele. 
          My pride and joy.  Charms the fish
          right out of the lake, she does.

                    PETE
          She's very pretty.

                    LARDNER
          Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way
          over, and maybe we can get to the
          bottom of who you are...

Lardner stares at him.  Pete takes note, turns toward him.

                    LARDNER
          ... sorry 'bout that, but you do
          look familiar to me.

                    PETE
          Wish I could say the same thing.

The Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and SHERIFF CECIL
ELDRIDGE, 45, gets out.  As he gets a few steps from the

                    HARRY
          Listen to me!  The young man in
          there...

Eldridge keeps moving to the door.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (interrupting)
          Stan Lawson found him unconscious
          by the wash this morning, and I'm
          here to investigate, and if we find
          anything interesting, it'll be in
          the paper, so why don't you just...

Harry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by the
shoulders.

                    HARRY
          Cecil, listen to me!

The sheriff stops.

                    HARRY
              (breathless)
          It's Luke.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

Sheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete.  He's staring at
him intently.  Silence.

                    ELDRIDGE
          No wallet, huh?

                    LARDNER
          No identification at all.
              (beat)
          What're you thinkin', Cecil?

                    ELDRIDGE
          What I'm thinkin' is we got us one
          a'two things here.  A mystery or a
          damn miracle.  And by god I can't
          tell which.
              (to Pete)
          Boy, you say you have no idea who
          you are?  That right?

                    PETE
          Yes.

                    ELDRIDGE
          You ever been in this town before,
          to your knowledge?

                    PETE
          No.  But...

                    ELDRIDGE
          But what?

                    PETE
          Well, this place sorta reminds me
          of something.

                    ELDRIDGE
          What's that?

                    PETE
          "It's a Wonderful Life."

                    ELDRIDGE
          The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I
          remember that one.  Saw it over at
          the Bijou.  So, you remember that,
          huh?

                    PETE
          "It's a Wonderful Life?"

                    ELDRIDGE
          Or the Bijou.  Either one.

                    PETE
          I remember the picture... but I
          don't remember where I saw it.

The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Doc, with your permission, I want
          to bring someone in here.  Maybe
          it'll jar this young man's memory.

                    LARDNER
          By all means.

Eldridge opens the door.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (to someone offscreen)
          Harry, why don't you come on in
          here.

Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head
of snow-white hair.  He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and
slowly turns to face Pete.  He looks closer... and closer. 
Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who
slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. 
Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe.

PETE

looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face...

HARRY

has tears forming in his eyes.  A smile turns up the corners
of his mouth, and quickly lights up his whole face.

                    LARDNER
              (softly, to Eldridge)
          Are you saying that he's...

                    ELDRIDGE
              (smiling broadly)
          Shhhhhh.

Harry takes Pete in his arms and hugs him tightly, burying
his face in Pete's shoulder and sobbing.

                    HARRY
          I knew all along.  I knew you were
          alive!  Oh, Luke...

Pete doesn't quite know what to think.  He clearly has no
idea who this old man is.

                    LARDNER
              (mouth agape in disbelief)
          Mother o'god...

                    ELDRIDGE
              (to Pete)
          Give the man a hug, boy!  That's
          your father!

Pete looks at Harry.  It's not so much that he remembers
anything -- he's swept up in the moment.

                    PETE
          My father...?

Pete wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tightly,
glancing over at

ELDRIDGE AND LARDNER

who look on goofily, fighting back tears.  They smile at
Pete, who smiles back tentatively.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

Harry, Pete, Eldridge and Lardner come outside.

                    ELDRIDGE
          C'mon, I'll give you two a lift
          back to the Bijou.

                    PETE
          The Bijou?

                    LARDNER
          That's where you live.

                    PETE
          We live in a theater?

                    HARRY
          Only one in town.
              (he opens the car door for
               Pete)
          Get in, son.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (sotto, to Lardner)
          Ben, when's Delly due back?

                    LARDNER
              (sotto)
          Tomorrow afternoon...
              (seized by a thought)
          ... oh my god...

                    ELDRIDGE
              (sotto)
          Exactly.  Break it to her gently.

Eldridge and Harry get in the car.  Lardner comes over to
Pete's back seat window.

                    LARDNER
          Get plenty of rest, Luke.  You took
          a pretty big wallop there.

He turns to move away, then turns back.

                    LARDNER
          Good to have you back.

Eldridge starts the car and they drive away.

(NOTE: Henceforth, "PETE" will be known as "LUKE."  It'll be
easier to keep track of things, since everyone's now calling
him Luke, anyway.  Trust me.)

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  ELDRIDGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY

Harry sits next to the Sheriff, and Luke has the back seat
all to himself.  He leans forward toward the front seat and
taps Harry on the shoulder.

                    LUKE
          Excuse me... what's your, um, your
          name?

                    HARRY
          Harry, son.  Harry.

                    LUKE
          And... what's my name again?

                    HARRY
          Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've
          been "Luke" since you were a baby.

                    LUKE
          Ah.
              (taking it for a spin)
          Luke.  Luke.  I like it.

Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street.

HIS POV

Shops are open for business, TOWNSPEOPLE are going about
their lives.  A few stop and watch as the Sheriff's car goes
by.

                    LUKE
          How long have I been gone?

Eldridge looks at Harry, who stares ahead.

                    LUKE
          How long?

Pause.  The silence is too thick, and Harry has to answer. 
He turns around in his seat and faces Luke.

                    HARRY
              (gently)
          You never came back from the war. 
          We were told you were missing and
          presumed dead.

                    LUKE
          When did I leave?

                    HARRY
          You joined up one month to the day
          after Pearl Harbor.  January
          seventh... nineteen forty-two.

Luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in.

                    HARRY
          Nine and-a-half years ago.

                    LUKE
          Nine and-a-half years...

                    ELDRIDGE
          Comin' up on the Bijou, gents.

EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE BIJOU - DAY

Eldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Here we are.

                    HARRY
          Well, son, you're home!

Luke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open...

HIS POV - THE BIJOU.

The Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of building
styles.  It's as though the architect took random parts of a
Chinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall
and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good
shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly
built the result.

As a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was
"The Bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message

                        " HE B J U"

was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet.

And now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " HE B
J U" sign becomes apparent.  Train tracks run right behind
the building on an elevated trestle.  As we watch, a TRAIN
ROARS BY.  Everything shakes.  It's not an earthquake, it's a
trainquake.  The "J" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening
to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers.

LUKE

stares at the monstrosity.  His face is ashen.  His heart has
sunk to somewhere below his knees.

The Bijou.

Harry jumps out of the car excitedly.

                    HARRY
          Thanks for the lift, Cecil.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Don't mention it.  Welcome home,
          Luke.

                    LUKE
              (faint smile)
          Thanks.

Luke opens the back door and slowly steps out.  Harry grabs
his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket.

                    HARRY
          Wait'll you see the inside!

                    LUKE
              (deadpan)
          Can't wait.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

The interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by
the exterior.  Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in
shards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross
between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with
generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable
combination of questionable taste and neglect.

Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --
probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole
theater --

A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.

Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut
crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and
scatter it in a hundred directions.

TILT DOWN TO REVEAL

Luke and Harry standing below.  Luke is lost in a gulf
somewhere between surprise and disgust.

                    HARRY
          We've been closed for a while.

                    LUKE
              (smiling wanly)
          Ah.

Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one
open.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

The ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem
to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional
row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved
itself up against the row behind or in front.

THE SCREEN

is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin,
framed by ragged red velveteen drapery.

In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old
upright piano.

Luke walks a few steps down the aisle.  He picks a seat on
the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits.  As he
does, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another
seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and
backstage.  Harry comes over and sits behind him.

                    LUKE
              (turning to Harry)
          Exactly how long has the Bijou been
          closed?

                    HARRY
          Hmmmm... after you left, it was
          difficult, and then Lily -- that's
          your mother -- she took ill and
          died... we haven't shown a picture
          since forty-eight.

                    LUKE
          Why?

                    HARRY
              (deep breath)
          Well, after the war, with so many
          of the town's boys killed, people
          around here didn't much feel like
          going to the movies, I guess.  Some
          of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles,
          Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't
          much to keep 'em here, I expect. 
          And now with this "television"
          thing -- people just aren't going
          out as much as they used to.

                    LUKE
          Didn't you have any help?

                    HARRY
          Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but
          they really couldn't help much. 
          Broke their hearts when we closed
          up.  Broke mine, too.
              (brightening)
          But now that you're back, well,
          things will be different around
          here, that's for sure.
              (rises, grabs Luke's arm)
          C'mon, I'll show you where we live.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY

The small apartment above the projection booth is quite a
contrast to the rest of the theater.  It's neat as a pin, and
fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains,
allowing the sun to flood the room.

A beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are

SEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS.

One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke.  It's a
Norman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue
olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  He has one
arm around Harry and the other around his mother.

(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even
in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)

                    HARRY
          The day you shipped out.  That was
          a proud day for your mother and me. 
          Last time you saw her.  Last time I
          saw you.

He smiles.

                    HARRY
          Till today.

Luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine
looking woman.  It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from
the 30's.

                    HARRY
          That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her
          soul.

                    LUKE
              (repeating)
          Mother.
              (to Harry)
          She's beautiful.

                    HARRY
              (coming over)
          Well, yes, that she was.  She
          certainly made this place a home.

He takes the picture from Luke, kisses it, and gently
replaces it on the table.  Luke goes over to the sofa and
sits.

                    HARRY
              (brightly)
          Can I get you anything?  I can put
          some coffee on or some...

Harry looks at Luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleep
on the sofa.

He goes to him, gently picks his feet off the floor, lifts
them onto the sofa.  Removes his shoes, sets them on the
floor.

                                                  CUT TO:

A BLANKET

being drawn up Luke's chest.

HARRY

stands, looks down warmly at his son.  Then, suddenly, he's
seized by a thought.  He turns and crosses to the window.

CLOSE - THE WINDOW

There's a small picture frame in the window.  Harry reaches
down, gingerly picks it up and turns it around.

ON THE FRAME

It's a single, faded gold star.  One war casualty.

Harry clutches it to his chest, looks over at the sleeping
Luke and smiles.

                    HARRY
              (softly)
          When I woke up this morning, my son
          was dead.  Now, I have my boy
          again.
              (closes his eyes)
          I have my boy again.

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT.  BIJOU APARTMENT - MORNING

It's early morning.  Luke is sound asleep, still in his
clothes.  In the distance, a train sounds its HORN.

Luke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly. 
Slowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed.

Something's strange, though.  He frowns.  The train is
GETTING CLOSER.  Luke's eyes POP OPEN.

LUKE'S POV

As the train RUMBLES BY, shaking everything in the room, Luke
looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him. 
Harry, an elderly WOMAN, and an elderly BLACK MAN.

                    HARRY
              (smiling)
          'Morning, Son.

                    ELDERLY WOMAN
              (smiling)
          Good morning, Luke.

                    ELDERLY BLACK MAN
              (no expression)
          'Mornin'.

                    HARRY
          Sleep well?

Luke is speechless.  It he dreaming this?

                    HARRY
          They couldn't wait to see you.

                    LUKE
          Who... are they?

                    HARRY
          This is the staff of the Bijou.

                    LUKE
          Oh.  What... what time is it?

                    HARRY
          Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an
          early start.

Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more
awake.  He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged. 
The elderly woman nudges Harry gently.

                    HARRY
          Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but
          you don't... you need to be re-
          introduced.  Luke, this is Mrs.
          Irene Terwilliger.

Luke stands and shakes MRS. TERWILLIGER'S hand.  She's tiny,
seventy if she's a day.  She smiles and curtsies slightly. 
Her eyes sparkle brightly, her manner almost coquettish.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Head cashier and refreshments
          clerk.  So glad to have you back,
          my boy!
              (to Harry)
          Much more handsome than I remember
          him.

                    HARRY
          And this fine fellow is our head
          usher, resident fix-it man and
          custodian.  Luke, meet Old Tim.
              (to Old Tim)
          You remember Luke, don't you?

OLT TIM is -- well, old.  His clothes are a tad shabby, but
well maintained, though they hang loosely on his gangly
frame.  He wears an old blue knit cap, which he quickly
removes as he shakes Luke's hand.  He's a man of few words,
his manner is painfully shy -- and he never smiles.

                    LUKE
          Is there a young Tim?

                    OLD TIM
          No.

                    LUKE
          Well, then, why do they call you
          "Old Tim?"

Pause.

                    OLD TIM
          I'm old.

Harry steps forward, takes Luke's arm.

                    HARRY
          Well, lots to do, so we'd better
          get a move on...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

Luke, Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger walk down the aisle toward
the screen.  Old Time lags a few steps behind.  At the
orchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit.  The
screen is a sea of repair patches.  Harry pats it.  Dust
flies.

                    HARRY
          'Fraid this has seen better days. 
          Well, I was meaning to get a new
          screen, anyway.

                    OLD TIM
          I n-need me a new uniform.

Luke looks at Old Tim, then at Harry.

                    HARRY
              (to Luke)
          I promised him a new uniform when
          we re-opened.
              (to Old Tim)
          And you'll get one, too.

                    LUKE
          You know, I hate to bring this up,
          but screens and uniforms and paint
          and repairs are going to take
          money, which I'm willing to bet
          none of us has.

Silence from the group.

                    LUKE
          I thought so.

Beat.  Harry brightens, clambers down the steps and races up
the aisle.

                    HARRY
          Anyone want to see the projector?

                                                  CUT TO:

TWO CARBON ARCS

are squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fan
motor.  A puff of smoke, then -- BZZZZZZZZZTT -- LIGHT.  A
metal door is closed over the arcs.

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - DAY

Harry dances around to the other side of the projector and
adjusts the focus on the beam of light.  The others look on
as he gazes at the screen through the tiny window.

                    HARRY
          Beautiful.  Bright and even from
          edge to edge.  See for yourself.

The carbons sputter and die.  The light flickers out.  Harry
is crestfallen, turns off the motor.

                    HARRY
          She's always been a bit tricky.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Mrs. Terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with a
ragged feather duster, a hopeless task.  Old Tim is on a
rickety ladder, replacing burned-out bulbs in the chandelier. 
The orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of the
ladder.

Old Tim climbs down and catches his breath.  Mrs. Terwilliger
sneezes.

                    OLD TIM
          Bless.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Thank you, Timothy.

They both stop their work and glance warily at the door
marked "OFFICE."

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (sotto)
          What do you suppose they're talking
          about?

                    OLD TIM
          Dunno.  Boy's smart.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (brightly)
          Yes, he seems to be.

                    OLD TIM
          Bad for us.

INT.  BIJOU OFFICE - DAY

Luke is poring over the ledger books, adding up figures on an
old manual adding machine.

                    LUKE
          Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the
          books here?

                    HARRY
          No, your mother did, then I did
          after she passed.

                    LUKE
          Well, I'm the first one to admit
          that I don't know anything about
          bookkeeping, but there are some
          very interesting things in here.

He scans down a page.

                    LUKE
              (reading)
          "February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball
          of Fire.'"

                    HARRY
              (appreciatively)
          Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. 
          Yowsa.

                    LUKE
              (reading)
          "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six
          admissions, receipts including
          concessions, $84.75... plus one
          fryer and two-dozen eggs."

He closes the book and looks expectantly at Harry.

                    HARRY
          Yes?

                    LUKE
          "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"

                    HARRY
          Forty-two was a lean year around
          here.  The war had just started...
          you were gone less than a month...
          and we were coming off a bit of a
          drought as I recall.  Not everyone
          could ante up the price of a
          ticket, and a chicken's as good as
          money if you ask me.  At that time,
          it meant a lot to the folks around
          here to be able to come to the
          pictures.

                    LUKE
          Yeah, I know, but poultry...?

                    HARRY
              (rhapsodically)
          I know it's hard to believe, son,
          but this place, this little place
          this wasn't a theater then, this
          was a palace!  Any man, woman,
          child, you, me, it didn't matter,
          you bought your ticket and you
          walked in and you...

Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs.

                    HARRY
          ... you were in a palace.  It was
          like a dream.  It was like heaven,
          like you died and went to a palace
          in heaven, that's what it was like. 
          And spotless, too.

Inspired, Harry stands, takes Luke by the arm.

                    HARRY
          Come with me!

He drags him out of the office and into the lobby.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim watch as Harry leads Luke
through the lobby.

                    HARRY
              (smiling)
          Maybe you had problems and worries
          out there, but once you came
          through that door, they didn't
          matter anymore.  In here, you were
          safe.  Maybe it was just an escape
          from reality, but... oh, god... it
          was beautiful.

Harry leads Luke into the auditorium.  The car follows, but
Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim stay behind.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

Harry trots down the aisle and looks up at the screen.

                    HARRY
              (exuberant)
          Charlie Chaplin.  Keaton and Lloyd. 
          Swanson.  And later on, Clark Gable
          and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy
          Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart
          and Becall and Judy and Mickey...
          and Fred and Ginger.

He turns to Luke.

                    HARRY
              (emphatically)
          They... were... like... gods!

He points to the screen.

                    HARRY
          And that... was the altar.  Would
          you remember if I told you, we felt
          lucky to be here, to have the
          privilege of watching them?
              (sadly)
          This television thing.  Why would
          you want to sit at home and watch a
          little box with a little screen? 
          Because it's convenient?  Because
          you don't have to get dressed and
          put on a coat and a tie and a hat? 
          Because you can just... sit there? 
          How can you call that
          "entertainment," all alone in your
          living room?  Where are the other
          people?  Where's the audience?

Harry comes over to Luke.

                    HARRY
              (emphatically)
          Where's the magic?

He stands behind Luke and whispers in his ear.

                    HARRY
          I'll tell you.  In a place like
          this, the magic is all around you. 
          All the time.  Everywhere.  In
          every thing.

He turns Luke around and looks him in the eye.

                    HARRY
          The trick... is to see it.

Pause.

                    LUKE
          But I...

                    HARRY
          Son, I think you loved the Bijou
          even more than I did.  You've got
          to remember that.  You've got to.

Still looking at Luke, Harry takes a step back, then slowly
walks up the aisle, disappearing into the lobby.

Luke walks down the aisle.  At the edge of the orchestra pit,
he stands looking up at the screen.  The orange tabby cat
MEOWS, and Luke glances toward it, standing onstage by the
edge of the screen.  They exchange looks as we

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Doc Lardner is seated in an easy chair, his feet up, reading
Life magazine.  The radio is on, and Patti Page is singing
"The Tennessee Waltz."

There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up.  In the
entrance hall, the front door opens.

ADELE "DELLY" LARDNER

enters.  She's a strikingly beautiful woman in her late 20s. 
She takes off a felt cap, and her long, auburn hair cascades
down.

                    ADELE
          Dad?

                    LARDNER
          Delly?  In here.

Lardner rises as Adele comes into the living room.  They
embrace warmly.

                    LARDNER
          How'd it go?

                    ADELE
          Not as bad as I thought it would. 
          I think I passed.

                    LARDNER
              (kisses her forehead)
          That's my girl!
              (he hugs her again)
          Did you...?

                    ADELE
          No hiccups, which was good.  Who
          wants an attorney who gets the
          hiccups when she gets nervous?
              ("serious" lawyer voice)
          "Your (hic!) honor, I (hic!)
          object!"

They laugh.

                    LARDNER
          I always told you, baby...
              (taps her head)
          ... it's all up here.

Lardner gives her an extra squeeze, continues to hold onto
her just a bit too long.  Adele detects something amiss.

                    ADELE
          Dad?  What is it?

Beat.

                    LARDNER
          Well, it's...

Adele breaks away from him.

                    ADELE
              (extreme concern)
          Oh my god... who died?

                                                  CUT TO:

A GLASS OF WATER

on a kitchen table.  Offscreen, we HEAR A HICCUP.  Then
another.  Adele's hand reaches into frame.

WIDER

INT.  LARDNER KITCHEN - EVENING

Lardner stands over Adele, who is seated at the table,
holding the glass of water.

                    LARDNER
          Drink slowly.

She raises the glass to her lips.

                    LARDNER
          From the other side of the glass.

It's a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water,
but Adele accomplishes it with aplomb.  She waits for a
moment -- then hiccups again.

                    ADELE
          I think (hic!) it's worse (hic!)
          now.

                    LARDNER
          That always used to work.

                    ADELE
          Yeah, well it's not everyday you
          get (hic!) news like this.  You're
          sure he's (hic!) okay?  Other than
          the (hic!) bump on the head?

                    LARDNER
              (hedging)
          Well...

                    ADELE
          (hic!) Dad... (hic!)

Lardner sits at the table and takes Adele's hand.

                    LARDNER
          He doesn't remember anything,
          Delly.  Doesn't know how he got
          here, doesn't remember his father,
          the town, the Bijou, anyone...

                    ADELE
          ... including me.  Right?  (hic!)

                    LARDNER
          I'm afraid not.  He looked right at
          your picture without batting an
          eye.  But it's probably temporary. 
          He got all the way to Lawson, so he
          clearly knew who he was and what he
          was doing until he hit his head. 
          I'm sure it'll all come back to
          him.  It just takes a catalyst.

                    ADELE
          You mean, (hic!) me?

                    LARDNER
          It's possible.

Off Adele's thoughtful hiccuping, we

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - EVENING

Luke and Harry, walking along, make a turn onto Commerce
Street, heading for Mabel's.  It's still light out, and a
soft breeze skitters some leaves along the sidewalk.

                    HARRY
          I take breakfast and supper at
          Mabel's every day except Sunday. 
          Have for years, since Lily died. 
          If it weren't for Mabel, I'd
          probably starve to death.

ERNIE COLE, a slight, balding man in his 50s, is locking the
door of his pharmacy across the street, when he spots Harry
and Luke.

                    ERNIE
          Harry!  Hold on a second!

Ernie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands
before Luke, staring.  Luke shoots a glance at Harry, who
taps Ernie on the shoulder.

                    HARRY
          It's really him, Ernie.

                    ERNIE
              (agape)
          Well, I'll be...

He sticks his hand out and Luke takes it.  Ernie pumps it
enthusiastically.

                    ERNIE
          By god, Luke, if it isn't good to
          see you again.

                    LUKE
              (uncertain)
          Uh, thanks.  Good to see you again,
          too, uh...

                    HARRY
          Ernie.

                    LUKE
          ... Ernie.

                    ERNIE
              (still at a lose)
          Well, I'll be...

                    HARRY
          We were just gonna get some supper. 
          Would you like to join us?

                    ERNIE
          Would I ever!

The three walk toward the diner, but before they get two
steps, they hear:

                    WOMAN'S VOICE
          Is that Luke Trumbo?

They turn to see a stout woman, KATIE RUTHERFORD, 40s,
rushing toward them.  She rushes right into a very surprised
Luke's arms and hugs him tightly.

                    KATIE
          Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you
          back!

                    HARRY
          Katie, would you like to join us
          for dinner?  The more, the merrier.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  MABEL'S DINER - NIGHT

The diner is packed.  In addition to Ernie and Katie, MEN,
WOMEN and CHILDREN occupy every seat and table, and many more
are standing, even hanging out the door.

At the focus of the crowd are Luke and Harry, seated at the
counter.  Harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner, while
Luke is working on a steak.  A young man seated at the
opposite side of the counter is speaking.  He's CARL LEFFERT,
30s.

                    CARL
              (eagerly)
          Hey, Luke, remember the time you
          and me, we was playing with
          firecrackers and the one you was
          lighting blew up too soon and
          singed all the hair offa my head?

A few people shake their heads, smile and laugh.

                    LUKE
          Uh, no.  What happened?

                    CARL
              (deflated)
          Well... um, all the hair got singed
          offa my head.  It was pretty funny.

A couple of TITTERS are heard.

                    LUKE
          Oh.

                    CARL
          Even my eyebrows.  But they grew
          back.

Luke leans toward Harry, who never looks up from his chicken.

                    HARRY
          Carl.  Friend of yours from high
          school.  Everybody calls him
          "Cueball."

                    LUKE
              (sincerely)
          Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.

                    CARL
              (brightening)
          Oh, heck, that's all right.  It's
          just good to have you back.  Isn't
          that right, Bob?  Hey, Luke, you
          remember my brother Bob?  You two
          joined up the same day.

Luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to Carl.

BOB LEFFERT

is a good-looking fellow, a few years older than Carl.  His
face is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down on
his forehead.  He looks up at Luke with hollow eyes.  Brings
his right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up.  Except
there's no hand there -- it's a hook.

                    LUKE
              (quietly)
          Hey, Bob.  Good to meet you.

Bob doesn't react.  He glances away, and for a moment, his
eyes meet Mabel's.  She smiles warmly.  He turns away.

Ernie Cole pipes up.

                    ERNIE
          Luke, I know there's a question
          that's on everybody's mind.

                    LUKE
          What's that?

                    ERNIE
          Well, now that you're back, what're
          your plans?

All eyes on Luke.  He freezes, having just taken a forkful of
food in his mouth.  Harry jumps in.

                    HARRY
          Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's
          what.

A MURMUR goes through the crowd.  Stanton Lawson, standing
behind Luke, taps him on the shoulder.

                    STANTON
          That true?

                    LUKE
              (on the spot)
          Well... we're gonna try.

                    ERNIE
          That's a lot of work, son.  Place's
          been closed, what, three, four
          years now.  Gonna be tough.

                    HARRY
          If it's tough, that means it's
          worth doing.

Someone shouts "That's the spirit!," another shouts "Hear,
hear!," and a chorus of VOICES join in agreement.

                    ERNIE
          Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt?

                    SPENCER'S VOICE
          Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor.

                    ERNIE
          Well, come on out here so's we can
          see you.

SPENCER WYATT steps around from the back of the crowd near
the door.  He's a tall, dark-haired, gangly, bespectacled
kid, no more than 19 or 20.  Painfully shy, he clutches a
clarinet case to his chest.  He timidly smiles and waves at
Luke, who smiles and nods back.

                    SPENCER
          Hey, Luke.

                    LUKE
          Hi, Spencer.

                    ERNIE
          Spence, that band of yours -- you
          think they're ready to play?
              (to Luke)
          Spencer and his pals went ahead and
          got together a good ol' big band.

                    SPENCER
          We've been practicing... uh, sure,
          I guess.

                    ERNIE
          Well, how about tomorrow night,
          eight p.m., in city hall square? 
          What I'm proposin' is a "Welcome
          Home Luke" celebration.

Vociferous general AGREEMENT from the crowd -- which is
quickly quieted by a MURMUR, which starts at the front door. 
The crowd parts and grow silent, revealing a woman standing
in the doorway.

ADELE

She locks eyes with Luke.  Her hand goes to her mouth and her
eyes well up.  Slowly, she moves around the counter, the
crowd moving aside for her.

She stands in front of Luke, who has stood up to meet her. 
Her eyes moist, she looks up at him.

                    ADELE
          Do you... remember me?

                    LUKE
          I've seen you before.  Your
          picture...

Mabel, clutching a napkin, leans over to Katie.

                    MABEL
              (sotto)
          Look!

                    LUKE
          ... but I don't think I remember
          you.

Adele leans up and kisses him softly.  He looks at her.

                    LUKE
          But I'll sure try.

As Mabel and Katie dab at their eyes, we

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - NIGHT

Adele and Luke stroll down the street side by side.  She
looks at him for a long moment.

                    LUKE
          What.

                    ADELE
          No, I... I just wondering where
          you've been all this time.

                    LUKE
          Me too.

                    ADELE
          You look... different.

                    LUKE
          I do?

                    ADELE
          Yeah, a little.  I think you grew
          an inch or so.  And you've lost
          weight.

                    LUKE
          I did?  Huh!

Tentatively, she takes his hand and holds it.  From behind
them, we HEAR A SHUFFLING SOUND.  Adele turns...

ADELE'S POV

Keeping a discreet distance, EVERYONE from the diner is
following them.  Adele turns and addresses the crowd.

                    ADELE
              (to the group)
          You can all go home, now.  He's not
          going anywhere.

                    LUKE
          Go on home, folks.  And thanks for
          the welcome.

Harry comes over.

                    LUKE
          I'll be home in a little while,
          Harry.  Don't wait up.

                    HARRY
          You two have a lot of catching up
          to do, I guess.

                    LUKE
          You bet.

                    HARRY
          Goodnight, son.
              (tips his hat)
          'Night, Delly.

And the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing the
pair goodnight.  Luke and Adele watch them disperse.

                    LUKE
          There.  We're alone.

They turn and start walking.

                    ADELE
          Then why do I feel like we're still
          being shadowed?

                    LUKE
          Well... where can we go?

Adele brightens.

                    ADELE
          I know a place.  Come on!

She grabs his hand and they run toward the town square.

EXT.  LAWSON CITY HALL - NIGHT

Adele and Luke stand by the front steps.

                    LUKE
          City hall?

                    ADELE
          You must not remember anything. 
          Come on.

She grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building.

EXT.  SIDE OF CITY HALL - NIGHT

Adele and Luke stand by a basement window, inches off the
ground.  She looks around.  Certain the coast is clear, she
pounds on the window in three "special" places, and it pops
up and open.  She looks at Luke.

                    ADELE
          You first.

                    LUKE
          Why me?

                    ADELE
          Be a gentleman.  You have to help
          me down.

AS LUKE CLIMBS IN, WE

                                                  CUT TO:

A LARGE, MUSLIN-COVERED OBJECT.

Slowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing A STATUE OF A
KNEELING SOLIDER, praying before a soldier's grave.  We
slowly PAN DOWN from the top of the statue... 

INT.  CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

                    ADELE (O.S.)
          When we were kids, my Dad was
          mayor, and you and me and a bunch
          of others used to come down here
          all the time.

ON ADELE AND LUKE

looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage
room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the
window.  The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet.

                    ADELE
          Of course, there was a lot more
          room before they stuck the memorial
          down here.

                    LUKE
              (looks at the door)
          How'd they get it inside?

                    ADELE
          Through the door.  It comes apart.

She moves to the memorial.  Squinting, she examines its base.

                    ADELE
          Your name's on here.  See?

Luke comes over.

ON THE BASE OF THE MEMORIAL -- LUKE'S NAME

                    ADELE
          Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." 
          And all the others.  I knew them
          all.  So did you.  We went to
          school with most of them.

                    LUKE
          It doesn't seem right, this being
          down here.  It ought to be where
          people can see it.

                    ADELE
          After they commissioned it, no one
          could ever agree on where to put
          it.  The Methodists wanted it in
          front of the Methodist Church, the
          Presbyterians wanted it in front of
          the Presbyterian Church, the city
          council wanted it in the lobby of
          City Hall.  Everyone finally got
          tired of the fighting.  So they
          stuck it down here.

He looks at her for a long moment.  There's an electricity
between them, and they both feel it.

                    LUKE
          So, you're really gonna be a
          lawyer?

                    ADELE
              (suddenly defensive)
          And why not?

                    LUKE
          Whoa.

                    ADELE
              (smiling)
          Sorry.  You don't know how many
          times I've heard that.  "A lady
          lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a
          woman couldn't be as good a lawyer
          as a man.  Or better, in fact.

                    LUKE
          Have you always wanted to be a
          lawyer?

                    ADELE
          You... don't remember, but yes,
          ever since I was a little girl.

                    LUKE
          What did... what did I want to be?

                    ADELE
              (gently)
          Oh, well... I guess you... in high
          school, you were a pretty good
          first baseman.  And we were on the
          debate team together.  But... I
          think you were gonna run the Bijou. 
          You were brought up there, and you
          loved it so much.  And I think you
          knew how much the town needed a
          place like that.

He turns away, rubs his head.

                    LUKE
          I just wish I could remember some
          of this.

He turns back to her.

                    LUKE
          You don't have a boyfriend or
          anyone... you know... like that?

                    ADELE
          Actually, I was married.  For four
          years.  But... well, we didn't fit
          together.  I'm divorced now.

                    LUKE
          I'm sorry.

                    ADELE
          No, it's okay.  See, when two
          people belong together, the other
          person should be the... the key
          that unlocks the rest of you... I'm
          not making sense, am I?

                    LUKE
              (moving toward her)
          No, you are.  I know exactly what
          you mean.  It's not that you're
          missing something.  It's that the
          other person gives something to
          you... that you had all the time. 
          You just didn't see it until they
          came along.

                    ADELE
              (smiling)
          Yeah...

Pause.

                    LUKE
          We were in love... weren't we?

                    ADELE
              (quietly)
          Yes.
              (then:)
          Hic!

She instantly covers her mouth, but it's no good.  She has
the hiccups again.

                    LUKE
          What was that?

                    ADELE
          Nothing.  (hic!)

                    LUKE
          Do you have the...

                    ADELE
          I'm (hic!) fine.  Really.  (hic!)

Luke smiles and watches Adele as she makes the decision to
not struggle against the hiccups.  She has them, and that's
just the way it is.

                    LUKE
          Were we going to get married?

                    ADELE
          Eventually.  We were going to be
          (hic!) engaged... when you came
          back from (hic!) overseas...

He looks at her.  She's strikingly beautiful at this
particular moment and in this particular light -- hiccups and
all.  He moves closer to her.  She moves closer to him.

                    ADELE
              (breathless)
          ... but you had to go... serve
          (hic!) your country...

They kiss passionately.  She reaches up and puts her arms
around him.  He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly
realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.

                    ADELE
          Hey... it worked.

And as she smiles and kisses him again we

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  THE BIJOU - NIGHT

Luke comes down the street and heads for the front door.  He
has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys
and enters.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

It's very dark.  Luke is about to swing shut the heavy door,
when he looks down and sees

THE ORANGE TABBY CAT

shoot into the lobby, stopping in the middle of the floor. 
It looks at Luke, and PURRS.

Luke closes the door and moves to the cat.  He crouches down
and pets it, and its back rises to meet his hand.

                    LUKE
          Hey, fella.  So you live here, too,
          huh?  How come Harry didn't mention
          that?

The cat moves to the auditorium door, pausing to look back at
Luke.  Curiosity piqued, Luke follows the cat.

INT.  BIJOU BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

In the dim light, we SEE an old mop and pail, some dirty film
cans, and a large beat-up cardboard standee of "The Tramp"
with the legend, "Chaplin Short To-Day."

The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door
at the end of a hallway.  Luke, following the cat, comes
around the same corner and looks at

THE DOOR.

Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as
the sound of Old Tim softly humming "It's a Long Way to
Tipperary."

Luke moves to the door and knocks.

                    LUKE
          Um, Old Tim?  Sorry, it's late. 
          It's Luke.  Can I come in?

The humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open,
revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat,
stroking its fur.

                    OLD TIM
          Found me.

                    LUKE
          Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I
          didn't know anyone lived here...
          well, besides Harry.  And me.

Old Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow
him.

INT.  OLD TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot,
which is perfectly made, military-style.

                    OLD TIM
          Not used to visitors.
              (gesturing)
          Sit.

Old Tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to
the "kitchen" area -- a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny
icebox.

Luke sits in the chair, and Old Tim sits on the cot, facing
him.  Silence.  Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau.

ON THE PHOTO

It's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious and
handsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform.

The cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke.  He
rubs against his legs, purring.  Luke leans down to pet him.

                    LUKE
          So I guess this fellow belongs to
          you.  What's his name?

                    OLD TIM
          Cat.

                    LUKE
          Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.
              (pets Cat)
          Hi, Cat.

                    OLD TIM
              (sudden change-of-subject)
          We thought you was dead, you know.
              (another new thought)
          It's okay that I live here?

                    LUKE
          Of course.

Pause, then suddenly.

                    OLD TIM
          Do you think I'll get me a new u-u
          uniform?

Luke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaks
more than a couple of words.

                    LUKE
          I'll do everything I can.

Old Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached.

                    OLD TIM
          T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I
          always... I always wanted to wear
          my uniform from the Great War, but
          your daddy, he always said no,
          that's not an usher's u-u-uniform,
          that's an army uniform and the
          Bijou, she's not the army.  They
          give me a medal, but I lost it in
          the h-h-hospital.  I forget things
          sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.

                    LUKE
          Yeah... me too.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY

It's a pretty typical bachelor's apartment.  The "SAND
PIRATES" poster leans up against a chair.  Pete's two boxes
of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table, the
empty bottle of Jack Daniels on top.

There's an insistent KNOCK at the door.

                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?  You
          in there?  This is the Super, I
          have the master key and I'm coming
          in!

We HEAR the key in the lock and the door swings open,
revealing the building SUPER, 50s.  Behind him is Leo
Kubelsky.  They enter the room, and the Super sniffs the air.

                    LEO
          You smell gas?

                    SUPER
          Don't smell nothin'.  He must not

Leo moves to the boxes and rummages through them.  He picks
up the empty bottle, examines it.

Leo peels off a hundred-dollar bill.

          Here's three months rent, and a ten
          spot for no more questions and to

          need a moment alone.

INT.  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

ON A DOOR

It reads: "OFFICE OF THE MAJORITY COUNSEL - MR. ELVIN CLYDE"

AGENT WALTER SAUNDERS and AGENT STEVEN BRETT, both 30s and G-
men to the core, hustle into the office.

INT.  ELVIN CLYDE'S OFFICE - DAY

ELVIN CLYDE is 35, a small, thin-lipped, reptilian man in the
Roy Cohn mold.  He's on the phone at the moment.

                    CLYDE
              (into phone)
          You say you know nothing about it. 
          You say this, yet you offer no
          proof.  How am I supposed to
          believe you?

Clyde's SECRETARY knocks on the door, sticks her head in.

                    SECRETARY
          Mr. Clyde?  Agents Saunders and
          Brett need to see you.

                    CLYDE
              (covering the phone)
          You do see that I'm busy, do you
          not?

                    SECRETARY
          It's about Appleton.

Clyde's eyes brighten.

                    CLYDE
          Tell them to come in.
              (into phone)
          I'll have to call you back.  I love
          you too, Mother.

Saunders and Brett stride into the office.

                    SAUNDERS
          We've got a situation developing...

                    CLYDE
              (interrupting)
          Will you take those goddamn hats
          off?

They stop, shuck off their hats.  Saunders starts over again.

                    SAUNDERS
          We've got a situation developing
          out on the coast.  Appleton's just
          been reported missing.

Clyde grins darkly.

                    CLYDE

Clyde considers this for a beat, then:

          You two are on this as of now. 
          Tell the LAPD their investigation
          has been federalized on my order. 
          You find me this Appleton.

          I want to see what this one has to
          say.

INT.  BIJOU OFFICE - DAY

Luke is sitting at the desk, making notes and adding up some
figures.  He puts his pencil down and rubs his eyes, then
looks up at

HARRY AND OLD TIM

who are sitting on the floor, going through piles of lobby
cards and folded one-sheets like little boys fascinated with
their baseball cards.

He shifts his gaze to

MRS. TERWILLIGER

who is straightening out and dusting the tops of the two or
three file cabinets in the corner of the office.  As she
works, she hums an old song, occasionally breaking into the
lyrics:

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (sings)
          "The object of my affection, Can
          change my complexion, From white to
          rosy red..."

Luke takes a breath:

                    LUKE
          Well...

                    HARRY
          Yes?

                    LUKE
          Between a new screen, paint,
          plumbing for the concession stand,
          and about a hundred other repairs
          around the theater... it's going to
          cost at least nine hundred dollars
          to get the Bijou into shape to open
          up.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Oh, my.

                    HARRY
              (taken aback)
          Nine hundred...

                    LUKE
          And you have sixty-eight dollars
          and thirty-seven cents in the bank. 
          Your only source of income are my
          veteran's death benefit of forty
          dollars a month, to which you're no
          longer entitled since I'm alive,
          and these ten dollar a month cash
          deposits you make.  What are those?

          Oh.

          It's all my fault.  I was
          neglectful and this is the price of
          that.

          Don't say that.

                    HARRY
          Well, it's true.  Wanting to open
          this place back up.  It's folly,
          Irene, pure and simple.  Might as

It's tiny, with rounded corners, black-and-white, and a
hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow.

WIDER

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Doc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television
set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "Your Show
of Shows."  He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit
ears, steps back -- and is successful.  SID CAESAR And
IMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch,
and Lardner fairly roars with laughter.

He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so,
the reception goes haywire.  He returns to the spot in front
of the TV, and the picture is perfect again.

The DOORBELL RINGS.  He's torn -- if he moves, the picture
will break up.  The doorbell RINGS again, and we HEAR Adele's
voice from upstairs:

                    ADELE (O.S.)
          Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him
          in?  I'll be right down.

                    LARDNER
          Honey, I... I can't... it's the...

There's a KNOCK at the door.

                    LARDNER
              (giving in)
          Oh, hell...

He moves from his spot.  The reception goes bad, and he
marches to the door.

He opens it, and Luke is standing there, wearing a slightly
out-of-date coat and tie.

                    LARDNER
          Evening, Luke.

                    LUKE
          Evening, Doctor Lardner.

Lardner freezes, staring at Luke.

                    LUKE
          What's wrong?

                    LARDNER
              (shaken from his reverie)
          Uh, no... just seeing you standing
          there, it reminded me... there's a
          word for it...

                    LUKE
          Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept
          all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but
          it's a little big.

Adele comes down the stairs.  Halfway down, she stops
suddenly and stares at Luke.

                    ADELE
          Oh...

Awkward pause.  Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at
Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.

                    LUKE
          I shouldn't have worn the suit.

Adele comes down the stairs.

                    ADELE
          No... you were wearing that suit
          the last time we went out before...

                    LUKE
          Oh...

                    ADELE
          ... and It's just... well, deja vu.

                    LARDNER
          That's it.  Deja vu.

Another awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other. 
Lardner breaks it.

                    LARDNER
          You kids off to the dance?

                    LUKE
          Aren't you coming?

                    LARDNER
          No, I'm not much of a dancer.

                    ADELE
              (chidingly)
          Besides, Daddy's still trying to
          figure out how to get his new
          television set working.

                    LARDNER
          I had it, a minute ago...

He glances at the TV set.  The picture is suddenly crystal
clear.

                    LARDNER
          ... ooooh, It's back.
              (encouraging them toward
               the door)
          Well, you kids have fun now...

Adele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights
with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living
room.

S-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the TV
carefully all the while.  The reception is staying perfect. 
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business,
and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.  He stifles
his urge, and heads for his chair.  Gingerly, he sits.  Still
perfect.

Satisfied, he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up. 
The picture goes completely haywire again.

                    LARDNER
          Aw, crap.

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Adele and Luke walk along, arm-in-arm.

                    ADELE
          This is strange.  Do you feel it?

                    LUKE
          What?

                    ADELE
          We've done this before, so many
          times.  The last time was so long
          ago, but it feels like yesterday.

                    LUKE
          Oh.

Pause.

                    ADELE
          You know, everyone's so excited
          about the Bijou re-opening...

                    LUKE
              (interrupting)
          It's gonna cost over nine hundred
          dollars to open the place, Delly.

                    ADELE
              (shocked)
          Nine hundred...

                    LUKE
          Yeah, and needless to say, none of
          us has that kind of money lying
          around.

                    ADELE
          What about a loan?  You could go to
          the bank...?

                    LUKE
          A loan to a man who ran his
          business into the ground and his
          son who can't account for the last
          nine-and-a-half years of his life? 
          Not likely.

                    ADELE
          Well, there's got to be a way...

                    LUKE
              (suddenly)
          Have you got a cigarette?

Adele stops.

                    ADELE
          When did you start smoking?

                    LUKE
          I don't smoke?

                    ADELE
          You tried to once.  It was pretty
          pitiful.

                    LUKE
          Oh.

Adele glances curiously at Luke as we

A CLARINET

launching into the opening bars of "Don't Be That Way," an
old Benny Goodman tune.

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY

Spencer Wyatt's big ban is comprised of a dozen or so
MUSICIANS about Spencer's age -- except for the drummer,
AVERY WYATT, 40s, Spencer's dad.  Though no Gene Krupa, he
pounds the skins pretty well, all the while smiling proudly
as his son plays clarinet and leads the band.

Despite the last minute decorations, the Square looks nice,
hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights.

ON LUKE AND ADELE

dancing to the music, along with several other COUPLES.

                    LUKE
              (nodding toward the band)
          They're not bad.

                    ADELE
          No, they're not.  I'd say your
          investment was paying dividends.

                    LUKE
          My what?

                    ADELE
          Back in '37, you heard Benny
          Goodman play for the first time, so
          you went out and got a used
          clarinet.  You wanted nothing more
          than to be able to play like him. 
          You tried hard, but it wasn't long
          before it was clear that Benny
          Goodman would never be looking over
          his shoulder.  So you gave the
          clarinet to Spencer.

                    LUKE
          Huh.  That was nice of me.

                    ADELE
          You had a hidden agenda, though. 
          See, when he was five or six,
          little Spence used to follow you
          around like a puppy.  Bothered the
          hell out of you.  But as soon as
          you gave him the clarinet...

                    LUKE
          ... he started practicing, and he
          left me alone from then on.

                    ADELE
          Exactly.  And he got good.

                    LUKE
          No kidding.

They dance a bit.

                    ADELE
          Now, did you remember that, or...

                    LUKE
          Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.

                    ADELE
          Oh.  Okay.

And as they dance away, we

Luke is pouring two glasses of punch, while Adele is being
shyly admired (and having her ear bent) by two twin brothers,
ALEX and CHARLIE MCKENNA, mid-20s.

          You're the luckiest guy in town,

          I'm Alex.  He's Charlie.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm Charlie.

          Yessir, 'bout the prettiest thing
          we ever seen, ain't that right,

          Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end.

The brothers laugh goofily.

          what's her name...?

          It's called the State Bar Exam.

Adele and Luke are slow dancing to "Thanks for the Memory."

                    LUKE
          How do you tell those two apart,
          anyway?

                    ADELE
          Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is
          the smarter one.

                    LUKE
          That's... pretty frightening.

They laugh and dance a bit more.

                    ADELE
          Your dancing's very good.

                    LUKE
          Thanks.

                    ADELE
          It never used to be.  You were two
          left feet on the dance floor.  Like
          pulling teeth to get you to do a
          little box step.

                    LUKE
          Guess I must've learned.

Luke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on
her face.  The band finishes the song, and everyone
enthusiastically APPLAUDS.  Spencer bows shyly, blushing
slightly.  He nods to the band, and they bow before he
motions for the crowd's attention.

                    SPENCER
              (nervously)
          Thanks, folks.  Gee, can you tell
          we never played in front of people
          before?

The crowd yells "No!," "You guys sound great!," etc.

                    SPENCER
          Well, this is our first time, and
          it's really all because of Luke.  I
          mean, it's because of Luke coming
          back that we're here tonight -- but
          I'm talking about this.

He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees
Luke.

                    SPENCER
              (to Luke)
          When you didn't come back, I
          learned how to play this so I could
          remember you.  And now that you're
          back, well, I'll never forget you.
              (to the crowd)
          Luke gave me this clarinet, but he
          gave this night to all of us.

The crowd APPLAUDS warmly.

                    SPENCER
          Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!

The crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser.  He
turns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums.

                    ERNIE
          Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?

Avery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or six
times to register his reaction.

ON THE KICK DRUM -- "WYATT'S HARDWARE, LAWSON, CALIF."

                    ERNIE
          Looks like you might have to find
          someone else to mix paint at the
          store, 'cause I think Spencer's got
          a big career ahead of him.

APPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle.  As soon as
he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent.

                    ERNIE
          You know folks, here in Lawson, we
          gave a lot for our country.  A lot. 
          And we never complained and we
          never faltered.  And we never
          forgot.

Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion.  He clears his
throat and continues.

                    ERNIE
          We never forgot.  And so when one
          of our own came back to us, I gotta
          tell you folks, it was like a
          miracle.  Luke, seein' you walking
          down the street, it was... well, it
          was kinda like seein' one of my
          boys alive again.  I think I speak
          for everyone here when I say that
          not a day goes by when we don't
          keep our boys' memories alive.  But
          Luke, having you back among us...
          well, it helps us keep their
          spirits alive, too.  God bless you,
          son.

The crowd APPLAUDS.  Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles. 
Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject.

                    ERNIE
          All right, enough a'that.  This is
          a celebration, so let's have us a
          good time -- but not too good a
          time, 'cause I see just about every
          member of the city council here
          tonight, and we have an eight a.m. 
          council meeting tomorrow morning,
          and I expect y'all to be there! 
          All right, take it away, Spencer!

And Spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAME - LATER

Luke and Adele come over to Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger,
standing at the periphery.  Old Tim stands a few feet back.

                    LUKE
          Why don't you two get out there and
          dance?

                    HARRY
          Oh, no, I...

Mrs. Terwilliger blushes.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          I haven't danced with another man
          since Mr. Terwilliger passed.

                    LUKE
          When was that?

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Nineteen-oh-nine.

Harry touches Luke's arm.

                    HARRY
          Son, we're gonna go.  You two kids
          have a lovely time.

Goodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves.  Alex McKenna
comes up to Adele and taps her on the shoulder.

                    ALEX
          Delly, can I have a dance?

                    ADELE
          Sure.

Alex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a
little "help me!" look.  Luke smiles back and watches the
dancing crowd.  After a moment, a man in a white suit and bow
tie, ROSCOE FITTS, 40s, comes over to Luke and extends his
hand.

                    FITTS
          Luke, you probably don't remember
          me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer
          here in town.

                    LUKE
              (shakes his hand)
          Good to meet you.  Again.

                    FITTS
          Like Ernie said, we're all glad to
          have you back.

                    LUKE
          Thanks.

                    FITTS
          And I hear you and Harry are
          planning on re-opening the Bijou.

                    LUKE
          We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot
          of work.

                    FITTS
          I can only imagine.  You know, I
          spoke with your Dad last year about
          maybe taking the Bijou off his
          hands.  I don't think he gave it
          very much thought.

                    LUKE
          Well, he loves the place.  It's his
          home.

                    FITTS
          Luke, I'm hopping you can help him
          see the reality of the situation. 
          I'll come to the point.  I want to
          buy the property, and I'm prepared
          to offer six-thousand dollars for
          it.  And that's just for the
          property, mind you.  If you want,
          I'll leave it to you and your
          father to dismantle and liquidate
          the building for whatever salvage
          value it has, and you keep those
          proceeds.  I just want the land.

                    LUKE
              (taken aback)
          That's... well, that's very
          generous, but if you've already got
          a store...?

                    FITTS
          The days of the storefront grocery
          are numbered.  I plan on putting up
          a free-standing supermarket.

                    LUKE
              (it's an alien word)
          A super market.  Huh.

                    FITTS
          You think it over.  No reason to
          risk financial ruin for the sake of
          a crumbling old building.

Fitts takes Luke's hand and shakes it.

                    FITTS
          Good to have you back, Luke.

As Luke watches Fitts walk off, we

                                                  CUT TO:

THE SAME - LATER

ON SPENCER

                    SPENCER
          Last dance, folks!

The crowd MOANS slightly, and Spencer kicks the band into
"Moonlight Serenade," slow and easy.

ON ADELE AND LUKE

As they hold each other close and dance.  Adele rests her
head on Luke's shoulder, her eyes closed.  Luke strokes her
hair and sways her gently to the music.

Luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor.

LUKE'S POV

Bob Leffert is standing there, staring at the band.  Mabel
comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.  She's
asking him if he would like to dance.  Bob looks down at the
ground, self-consciously shoves his hook-hand in his pocket
and moves away, leaving Mabel standing there.

As Luke watches and the MUSIC CONTINUES OVER, WE

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE:

Luke and Adele dancing...

... walking slowly arm-in-arm down Adele's street, up her
walk to her door...

... kissing passionately on her doorstep...

... Adele going inside and Luke walking away, each unable to
take their eyes off the other...

... Luke walking the quiet streets of Lawson, smiling
beatifically...

                                        MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  THE BIJOU - NIGHT

Luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door.  He
pulls out his keys and enters.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Luke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees

CAT

MEOWING at him from the sidewalk.  He holds the door open,
and Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the
auditorium.  Luke closes the door... and stops.  He HEARS
something, and so do we.  Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. 
The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby.

Luke turns toward the music, which is coming from the
auditorium.  The piano continues, building slightly in
volume.  He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively
pushes one open.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Luke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering,
reflected light of

THE SCREEN.

The movie is "The Big Parade."  The old, decomposing nitrate
print is badly scratched and stained.  A young, beautiful
Renee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John
Gilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War.

Luke stares at the screen.  The look on his face is one of
bewilderment -- and awe.

ANGLE - THE PIANO

The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out-
of-tune.  But it really doesn't matter.

CLOSER

Mrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately.  She never takes
her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered
screen, except to close them when she is overcome with
emotion.  Even so, she never misses a beat.

HER HANDS

fairly dance upon the keys.  Stiff and wrinkled as they are,
they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity
that the old piano can muster.

Luke is moved by what he's witnessing.  This is the magic...

WIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION

To the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old
Tim.  Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene
unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and
nose with a handkerchief.  He doesn't notice

LUKE

who looks up towards the projection booth.

                                                  CUT TO:

A BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT,

filling the frame.  We're looking directly into the beam of
light radiating from the projector.

PUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the
booth.  We come out of the beam and can just barely make out
the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the
projector.

WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's
face fills the screen.  He is watching the film; his eyes are
wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's
unfolding on the screen for the very first time.

The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES,
signaling the end of the reel.  Harry moves away from the
window.

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Never taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the
film comes to an end and flap!  falp!  falps!  out of the
projector.  He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs
apart, and the bright beam dies.  It's not the end of the
movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have.

Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades
them up.  This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back
pocket and blows his nose loudly.

He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up
reel and takes it down.  He's about to move away, when he
senses that he's not alone.  He looks over the projector to
see

LUKE,

standing there.  Their eyes meet.  Someone should say
something -- both men search for words.  Suddenly, Luke feels
very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's
interrupted a very private ritual.

Harry senses this.  Clutching the precious reel of film
tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles
warmly.

                    HARRY
          Beautiful, wasn't it?

                    LUKE
              (softly)
          Yes.

                    HARRY
          Well, son, I wish I could've shown
          you more, but this is all that's
          left.  Just this one reel that
          never got sent back from a picture
          we showed here a long time ago. 
          Nineteen twenty-five, to be
          exact...

                    LUKE
          Dad, I...

                    HARRY
              (a tiny laugh)
          Ha!

                    LUKE
          ... what?

                    HARRY
          You know, since you've been back,
          that's the first time you've called
          me "Dad."

Father and son look at each other for a long moment --
searching each other's eyes.  Harry smiles a sort-of half-
smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the
rewind bench.  Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end
of the film onto an empty reel.  Slowly, he begins to turn
the crank, rewinding the film.

He stops and looks to where Luke was standing... but he's not
there.

ANGLE - PROJECTION BOOTH DOOR

Luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the
projection booth.

ONE LUKE

As he closes his eyes...

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

ON HARRY

In bed, sound asleep, snoring.  A HAND reaches into frame and
shakes him awake.

                    LUKE'S VOICE
          Harry.  Dad, wake up.  Wake up.

Harry opens his eyes and looks up.

INT.  HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

                    HARRY
              (bleary)
          Luke... what time is it?

                    LUKE
          Six-thirty.
              (smiles)
          I thought we'd get an early start.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CITY COUNCIL MEETING ROOM - DAY

A meeting of the Lawson City Council is in session, Mayor
Cole presiding.  Of the dozen council MEMBERS, we also
recognize Avery Wyatt and Roscoe Fitts.  VERA DWIGHT, the
council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading
the minutes of the last meeting.

                    VERA
          Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and
          Red Curtis seconded, that the
          council form a committee to
          investigate the adoption of a new
          property taxation structure. 
          Motion carried, nine to two, one
          abstention.

As Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry,
Old Time and Mrs. Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on
the unoccupied benches.

                    ERNIE
          Thanks, Vera.

Ernie notices Luke and the trio.

                    ERNIE
          Well, the chair notes the presence
          this morning of Luke and Harry
          Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou
          staff.  Frankly, the chair notes
          the presence of just about anyone
          who ever finds their way into one
          of these meetings.  G'moring,
          folks.

                    LUKE & THE TRIO
          Good morning.

                    ERNIE
          I'm just guessing, but I bet it's
          not a sudden interest in Lawson
          politics that brings you all here.

Luke stands.

                    LUKE
          Well, no...
              (clears his throat)
          I wanted to thank you all for
          giving me such a nice welcome, and
          making me feel at home.  But I...
          we're... actually here on business
          of a sort...

DALEY THORNHILL, 30s, the council parliamentarian, pipes up. 
He's waving a copy of "Roberts Rules of Order."

                    DALEY
          Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this
          comes under the heading "New
          Business," and this is not the
          time...

                    ERNIE
          I think we can make an exception
          here, Daley.

                    DALEY
          It'll need to be moved and
          seconded.

Ernie rolls his eyes, then quickly and mechanically, without
inflection:

                    ERNIE
          All right, motion to hear the
          speaker out of order.

                    WYATT
          Seconded.

                    ERNIE
          Motion on the floor, discussion
          open, discussion closed, all those
          in favor signify by saying "aye."

                    ALL
          Aye.

                    ERNIE
          Opposed?  Hearing no opposition,
          the motion is carried.

Pause.  Ernie turns to Luke and smiles.

                    ERNIE
          Go ahead, son.

                    LUKE
          Thanks.  Well, I'll make this short
          and sweet.  The Bijou needs a lot
          of repairs, and the truth of the
          matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad
          and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old
          Tim, we can't possible afford them
          all.  So, I'd like to ask your help
          to... well, to scrounge around a
          bit, and see if you have anything
          that might help us out.

                    WYATT
          What kinds of things are you
          talking about?

                    LUKE
          Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light
          bulbs, yardage, and if you can't
          come up with any of that, we can
          use some old-fashioned elbow
          grease.

Fitts leans forward.

                    FITTS
          So... you do intend to fix the
          place up after all?

                    LUKE
          Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I
          think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit
          more than it needs a super market. 
          And I think Lawson deserves the
          Bijou.  There's not a lot that can
          be done to help us get past the
          pain we've all felt...

He looks at Harry and smiles.

                    LUKE
          ... but I think a good dose of
          magic is as good a place as any to
          start.

The council members MURMUR amongst themselves, then:

                    WYATT
              (eagerly)
          Motion to encourage the citizenry
          of Lawson to help out the Bijou in
          any way they can...

                    DALEY
              (a subtle reminder)
          ... short of the allocation of city
          funds...

                    WYATT
              (agreeing)
          ... short of allocation of city
          funds.

                    DALEY
              (enthusiastically)
          Seconded!

                    ERNIE
              (brightly)
          Motion on the floor, discussion
          open, discussion closed, all those
          in favor signify by saying "aye."

                    ALL
          AYE!

                    ERNIE
          Hearing no opposition, the motion
          is carried!  Congratulations, Luke,
          you got yourself a town to help you
          out!

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - DAY

As the entire city council and the Bijou trio looks on, Luke
moves to the memorial and pulls down the huge piece of muslin
covering it.  Harry steps forward and gathers some of it in
his arms.

Ernie and Daley step forward and look up at the monument.

Ernie touches the names of his two sones inscribed on the
base of the monument.

                    ERNIE
              (slowly)
          You know, this really ought to be
          out where people can see it.

Luke overhears this last, and as he smiles, he turns to
Harry, who brightens as he pulls a large section of the
muslin taut between his outstretched arms...

                                                  CUT TO:

MONTAGE - WITH SOME HARD-DRIVING BOOGIE-WOOGIE UNDER...

ANGLE - THE SCREEN

Harry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old
screen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke
and Adele, who are surrounded by a group of LITTLE KIDS,
watching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe.

Harry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen
drops down on Luke's head.  Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!!  He
raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who
scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

Old Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the
aisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten
carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris.

The men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just
as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to
Harry and grabs his end.  It's Carl Leffert.  A second later,
someone else grabs Old Tim's end.

BOB LEFFERT

has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his
hook.  He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow.

Luke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Harry, Stanton and Mrs. Terwilliger, with the help of Avery
Wyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies
and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls.  Then,
as Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and
Mrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall
paint and brushes.  Immediately, they all set to work
painting.

EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY

Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool
box nearby.  He's just straightened out the "J" and he steps
back... carefully... to admire his handiwork.  For the first
time in a long time, the sign actually reads, "THE BIJOU."

But not for long.  Luke tenses... the building starts
shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.  Luke
lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. 
Once again, the sign reads, " HE B J U."  Luke winces.

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY

Ernie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a
small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it
takes shape in a prominent place in the square...

INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY

Harry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to
a corner of the muslin.  It snaps into place, and voila --
new screen!  Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge,
standing below, applaud enthusiastically.

INT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY

As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just
finished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover
and trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits,
closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude
No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a
bit out of tune, it's still beautiful.

As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before
long, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. 
Transported.

After a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. 
Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.

                    LUKE
          That was beautiful.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          I taught you that.

                    LUKE
          I can play the piano?

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (all fluttery)
          Oh dear, yes.  You were an
          excellent student, before all that
          clarinet nonsense.  You loved
          Chopin.  You used to call it
          "heaven music."  "Teach me some
          heaven music," you used to say.

She sits at the piano.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Sit.  Play with me.

                    LUKE
          No, I...

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Some of it might come back to you.

Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left.  As she begins to
play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          That's good... that's good...

But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just
plunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures
he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's
transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie
woogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Really, Luke!  That's no way to
          treat Mr. Chopin!

She stands and moves away.  Luke keeps playing, grinning
madly -- he's loving it!  After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs
over and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top
half to Luke's bass line.

OLD TIM

is tapping his foot to the beat.  He turns to Adele and says:

                    OLD TIM
          I taught him that.

Off Adele cracking up.

THE MONTAGE CONTINUES...

EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY

Luke and all the letters up again.  He steps back, checks his
watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train
goes by.  This time, however, only the "J" tips over at a
jaunty angle.  Luke smiles.

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Luke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter,
devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed
potatoes and gravy.  Luke's and Adele's hair is practically
white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are
stained with paint specks.

At the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably
with Bob Leffert.  She smiles at him warmly, then turns to
refill Harry's coffee cup.  Harry thanks her, then turns back
to the newspaper he's reading.

INSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN

Prominent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a
policeman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying
headline:

               BOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S
               JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH

EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - NIGHT

Luke's standing near the sign.  He yells to Adele, down below
on the ground.  She, in turn, yells to Harry, standing near a
switch panel behind the candy counter.  He throws the
switch...

... and the sign lights up beautifully!  Then, they all feel
the rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle
and shake, no letters fall.  A CHEER goes up from Adele,
Harry, and the small crowd of ONLOOKERS below.  Delighted,
Luke takes a formal bow.  The boogie-woogie ends as we

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY

ON THE MEMORIAL

Complete and polished, standing proudly in the center of the
square.

WIDER

It's a clear, balmy day, and the whole town is turned out. 
Mayor Ernie Cole is at the podium.  He finishes his remarks,
then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost
lives of his sons.  He holds them up, high above his head.

ON THE CROWD

One-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly
held aloft by their loved ones.

Luke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out
at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. 
Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform...

LUKE'S POV

It's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in
his dress greens.  He brings his hook-hand up and salutes
smartly.  Mabel takes his good hand, squeezes it as she
blinks back tears.

Luke smiles at this scene as Harry wipes his eyes and puts
his arm around Luke's shoulder, pulls him close and kisses
him on the forehead.

THE SAME - LATER

The Lawson High School Marching Band is set up on the steps
of City Hall, playing the "Star Spangled Banner."  They are
being conducted by their director, MR. PHILLIPS.  Luke and
Harry, hands over their hearts, watch and sing along.  Then,
Luke takes a closer look at the DRUM MAJOR...

ON THE DRUM MAJOR,

a tall young man wearing an ornate brocaded red and white
uniform with "LHS" emblazoned across the chest.

ON LUKE

He has an idea.  The anthem ends, and Luke excuses himself
and moves forward, buttonholing Mr. Phillips as he comes down
the steps...

EXT.  BIJOU - DAY

Luke and Adele are on ladders, hanging letters on the
marquee, which reads:

                 GRAND RE-OPENING TONIGHT!
                         GENE KELLY
                    AN AMERICAN IN PARIS

Harry comes outside and gets their attention.  Grandly, he
gestures toward the door, and out strides

OLD TIM,

wearing his new uniform -- it's the Lawson High School drum
major's uniform, modified here and there.  "B-I-J-O-U" is
proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters.

Luke and Adele applaud.  Old Time looks up at them -- AND
SMILES!

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Old Tim stands at attention, clutching the front door handle. 
Mrs. Terwilliger, wearing a new dress, her hair newly and
perfectly coiffed, stands at the ready at her candy counter,
ready to sell tickets and refreshments.

Harry and Luke nervously pace the lobby.  Luke checks his
watch.  It's time.  He shakes Harry's hand, and nods to Old
Tim, who swings the door open...

ON THE DOOR

Immediately, PATRONS come flooding into the theater.  Luke
exchanges surprised glances with Harry -- then walks outside.

OUTSIDE THE THEATER

Luke comes out and looks down the block.

HIS POV

The line of PATRONS stretches two deep down the block and
around the corner.

Luke smiles.  Success.

THE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- "FRED ASTAIRE - ROYAL WEDDING"

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY

Luke's selling tickets from behind the candy counter while
Mrs. Terwilliger sells refreshments to a line of CUSTOMERS. 
Luke sells a ticket to a WOMAN, who moves away, revealing

BOB LEFFERT AND MABEL.

Luke smiles at Bob, who smiles back, his eyes now fairly
dancing with life.  He plunks down his admission, and Luke
hands him two tickets, which he takes with his hook-hand. 
Mabel smiles at Luke, takes Bob's good hand, and they move
away, revealing A FARMER AND HIS WIFE, 50s.

The Farmer steps up and holds out a plucked chicken by its
neck.

Luke, surprised, jumps back -- then smiles, pulls off two
tickets, and exchanges them for the chicken.

INT.  BEHIND THE SCREEN - NIGHT

The only light back here is the light of the movie, spilling
through the screen.  Luke is straightening up the backstage
storage area, when Adele taps him on the shoulder.  He turns,
and she throws her arms around his neck and kisses him.  She
hands him a paper to read.

ON THE PAPER

Luke angles it so he can read it by the light of the screen. 
It says:

              California State Bar Association
                    ADELE LOUISE LARDNER
            has PASSED the State Bar examination.

Luke, thrilled, grabs Adele and picks her up, twirling her
around with joy.  He sets her down and kisses her
passionately.

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Harry is frantically threading the changeover projector.  The
bell on the running projector DINGS! once, signalling that
the reel is coming to an end.  Harry looks out the window at
the screen, then back to the task at hand.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster. 
With a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring
how handsome the old place looks.  Old Tim, snappily attired
in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a
dustpan.  Mrs. Terwilliger is straightening up the candy
counter.  All is well.

Luke goes to the lobby's poster case.  He opens it, and
unfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for "SAND PIRATES" --
the same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment. 
Methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the
case.

As Luke passes the auditorium doors, a MAN comes out of the
theater and crosses to the candy counter.  The door stays
open for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch
a bit of the picture.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

ON THE SCREEN - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"

The second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's
programmer.  It's nighttime in the desert.  A huge full moon
hangs over a B-movie soundstage version of the pyramids. 
GREGORY, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is
engaged in a fierce swordfight with KHALID, the villain.

Pete takes a seat on the aisle near the door.

                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
          You don't think you can win this,
          do you?

Khalid lunges and draws Gregory's blood.

                    LUKE
              (ala "Khalid")
          "Ha!  I'd say I was winning!"

                    KHALID (ONSCREEN)
          Ha!  I'd say I was winning!

Luke's look is "How did I know he was gonna say that?"

Onscreen, an EVIL HENCHMAN is sneaking up behind Gregory.

                    LUKE
          "Gregory!  Look out!"

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)
          Gregory!  Look out!

Pete did it again.

Onscreen, Gregory turns and kills the Henchman, then quickly
dispatches Khalid.  He stands over the body, catches his
breath and says:

                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
          It's all right, Rebecca.

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)
          Is he dead?

                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
          Yes, Rebecca.  He's dead.

REBECCA, a beautiful American woman, comes into view and
takes our attention because she's being played by Sandra
Sinclair, Pete Appleton's ex-girlfriend...

ON LUKE

His mouth is gaping open.  He stares at the screen.

                    LUKE
              (a whisper)
          Sandra...?

Luke stands.  Confused, he stumbles backward, moving into the
lobby as the Man goes back into the auditorium with his
popcorn and the door closes.

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Luke is staring at the closed auditorium doors.  Old Tim and
Mrs. Terwilliger take note of his odd behavior.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Luke?  Dear, are you all right?

Without answering, Luke turns and runs to the poster case.

ON THE POSTER - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"

Forget the cheesy B-movie artwork.  As Luke looks at the
poster, it's clear that he's remembering something.  He looks
at the picture of Sandra -- then scans down to the credits
block at the bottom of the poster.  His eyes lock upon

                 WRITTEN BY PETER APPLETON

                    LUKE
          My god... my god... no...

Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing
down on him...

... because he remembers...

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

The warning bell DINGS! twice, but the changeover projector's
carbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying.

                    HARRY
              (pleading)
          Oh, baby, make your daddy happy...

Harry's trying to keep the projector going, as the previous
reel is about to end.  Given no other choice, he finally
gives the changeover projector a good swift kick.

It hums to life.  A perfect changeover.  Harry pets the
projector.

                    HARRY
          You're a good girl.  No matter what
          I say.

As he turns away, he feels a sudden, sharp pain in his left
arm.  Wincing, he grabs his arm, staggers back towards a
chair, and sits heavily.

He tries to clear his throat, but it dissolves into a
hacking, choking COUGH.  He tries to stand, but drops to his
knees, clutching his left arm harder than before.

                    HARRY
              (in pain)
          Oh, Jesus...

Harry falls to the floor, and as he does

THE FILM

breaks in the projector gate... flap!  flap!  flap!...

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Luke is still staring at the poster, lost in thought. 
Offscreen, we HEAR the audience WHISTLING AND HOOTING in
reaction to the broken film.

Mrs. Terwilliger has been calling Luke's name, but he doesn't
come out of his stupor until Old Tim comes up behind him and
spins him around...

                    OLD TIM
          Mr. Luke!

Luke stares wide-eyed at the old man.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! 
          The film broke, and I can't raise
          Harry on the house phone!

                    LUKE
              (still dazed)
          What?

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          You've got to talk to them before
          they tear the theater apart!

Finally, Luke pulls himself together, hears the audience
noise, and moves toward the auditorium doors.

INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Amid the shouting and tossing of popcorn and debris, Luke
tries to regain his composure as he strides down the aisle
toward the stage.

                    LUKE
          Come on, folks, this happens every
          once in a while, just settle
          down...

The crowd quiets down a bit.  Luke shields his eyes from the
light and calls up to the projection booth.

                    LUKE
          Harry!  Harry, why don't you cut
          the projector and bring up the
          house lights?

No reaction.  Just the flickering beam of light.

                    LUKE
          Harry?  Harry...?

Luke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into
the lobby.  The crowd goes silent...

INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT

Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger watch as Luke tears into the
lobby and makes for the balcony stairs...

INT.  BALCONY - NIGHT

... and charges between the seats and up the stairs to the
projection booth.

INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

Luke bursts in the sees Harry on the floor.  He rushes over
and kneels down next to him.

          The film broke...

          I know, I know... keep still.

A MAN pops his head into the projection booth door.

                    LUKE
              (to the man)
          Get Doc Lardner.

INT.  HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Harry is in bed, eyes closed.  Doc Lardner has a stethoscope
to his chest.  He leans up and pats Harry's hand.

He stands and comes over to Luke and Adele, who are near the
door.  Just outside, angling for a view into the room, are
Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger.

                    LARDNER
          It's a pretty massive heart attack. 
          His lungs have filled with fluid,
          and, well... it seems as though his
          body is just... shutting down.

                    LUKE
          Can we get him to the hospital?

                    LARDNER
          Even if we could, and the move
          didn't kill him, there'd be very
          little we could do there that we
          can't do here.
              (puts his hand on Luke's
               shoulder)
          I'm sorry.

Harry's eyelids flutter.

                    HARRY
              (weakly)
          Did you... did you...

Luke rushes to Harry's side and takes his hand.

                    LUKE
          I'm here.

                    HARRY
          Did you... did you...

                    LUKE
          Did I what?

                    HARRY
              (irritated)
          Did you fix the damn film?  It
          broke in the last reel.

                    LUKE
          I know.  Everyone went home.  We
          offered them refunds.

                    HARRY
          Anybody take it?

                    LUKE
          A few.

                    HARRY
              (closes his eyes)
          Vultures...

Luke smiles.

                    HARRY
          I'm not happy about this, mind you,
          but if I have to go, at least I'm
          going in my own bed, the same bed
          my Lily died in, and... knowing
          that my son is alive.  That's not
          too shabby, is it?

                    LUKE
          You're not going anywhere, Harry.

                    HARRY
          Don't tell me, I know about these
          things.  I've seen it before.  It's
          all right.  It's... all right. 
          You're here.  Oh, God, I love you,
          son.

Harry smiles.  Luke kisses his hand and leans up, whispering
in Harry's ear:

                    LUKE
          And I love you... Dad.

Harry smiles faintly, looks at Luke.  He nods, then closes
his eyes.

                    HARRY
              (softly)
          Oh, so... much... lighter...

Slowly, Harry exhales.  His face relaxes, completely at
peace.  He doesn't breathe again.

Luke looks at Harry's face for a moment.  Then as the tears
well up, he leans over and ever-so-gently places a kiss on
Harry's forehead.

EXT.  LAWSON CEMETERY - DAY

It's a beautiful, bright, sunny day.  Luke and Adele stand at
the front of the large group of mourners.  REVEREND COLEMAN,
50s, conducts the service.

                    COLEMAN
          We commit to the earth the mortal
          remains of Harry Bernard Trumbo,
          safe in the knowledge that his
          immortal soul is at peace and at
          last reunited with his beloved
          Lillian in the bosom of the Lord. 
          Let us pray.

Everyone bows their heads.

                    COLEMAN
          "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
          not want, he maketh me to lie down
          in green pastures..."

Luke looks up at the sky, then steps forward and lays a
single rose on Harry's casket.  Then, as everyone
surreptitiously watches, he turns and walks away from the
gravesite, toward the cemetery entrance.

Adele watches Luke depart...

ANOTHER ANGLE

... and she's not alone.  Agents Saunders and Brett are
watching everything from their car, which is parked nearby. 
As Luke walks away, Saunders snaps his photo with a long-lens
camera...

THE BASE OF THE WAR MEMORIAL,

and Luke's name inscribed there.

EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DUSK

Luke stands in front of the memorial, head bowed.  After a
moment, he sits, leaning against the memorial.

ON LUKE

Lost in thought, he buries his face in his hands.

                    ADELE'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Mind if I join you?

Luke looks up, squinting.  Adele stands above him, backlit by
the golden light of the sundown.

                    LUKE
          Sure.

She sits next to him.  Tentatively, she touches his shoulder. 
He leans into her, and she enfolds her arm in his.

Pause.

                    LUKE
          Your father said... that I would
          start to remember things.

Suddenly, Adele feels as though she's walking on eggshells.

                    ADELE
              (slowly)
          What... do you remember?

                    LUKE
          Well... everything.  It started
          coming back a couple of days ago. 
          I remember everything now.

                    ADELE
          I see...

                    LUKE
          Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry
          wasn't my father.  And I'm not...
          I'm not Luke.

She closes her eyes.  All her suspicions are suddenly
confirmed.

                    ADELE
              (adrift)
          Oh...

Her tears start, and she moves to hug Luke -- but instead,
she starts hitting him, flailing, beating on his chest.  He
hugs her tightly, and she completely lets go.

                    ADELE
              (crying)
          Oh, god, I knew!  I knew!  I knew
          from the start!  I wanted you to be
          Luke!  I wanted you to be alive! 
          You're so much like him, you have
          no idea.  No wonder everyone else
          accepted you!  You don't know what
          you -- what Luke meant to this
          town, suddenly being alive!  You
          don't know what this town lost! 
          You just don't know...

She pulls away, stands, and looks him in the eye.  Luke
rises.

                    ADELE
              (sobbing uncontrollably)
          I knew you weren't Luke!  And I
          tried not to fall in love with you! 
          And... I don't even know your name! 
          Oh, god...

Luke moves toward her.  She backs away.

                    LUKE
          I fell in love with you, too,
          Delly.  Only now I don't know how I
          feel, about you or about anything. 
          I only think I know how Luke would
          feel.

She's still sobbing.  He moves to her, takes her in his arms.

                    LUKE
          Delly, shhhhhh...

                    ADELE
              (pulling away)
          No... I can't... I have to... I

ON SHERIFF ELDRIDGE,

making short work of a steak and eggs.  As he powers down his
meal, Agents Saunders and Brett, distinctly out-of-place in
their dark suits and hats, enter the diner.  They take note
of Eldridge, and come over.

                    SAUNDERS
          Are you the sheriff?

                    ELDRIDGE
          And I got the uniform to prove it.

                    SAUNDERS
          I'm Special Agent Walter Saunders,
          this is Special Agent Steven Brett,
          FBI.  May we have a word with you?

They flash identification, which Eldridge notes.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (gesturing)
          Please, sit.

They sit across from Eldridge.  As Saunders speaks, Agent
Brett pulls a photo from his coat pocket.

                    SAUNDERS
          A couple of days ago, a county
          flood control maintenance crew
          pulled a car out of the Lawson Wash
          ocean outlet.  They checked its
          registration, and when the owner
          was identified, they notified us.

Agent Brett slides the photo toward Eldridge.

ON THE PHOTO

It's Peter Appleton -- Luke.

                    ELDRIDGE
              (smiling)
          Well, that'd be Luke Trumbo.  Looks
          like you boys've solved a little
          mystery we've had going on for a
          few months.

                    BRETT
          Sir, that's a photo of man named
          Peter Appleton.  He's been missing
          from Los Angeles for close to three
          months now.

                    ELDRIDGE
          What?  No, there's got to be a...

                    SAUNDERS

Pete sits across from Eldridge, Saunders and Brett.  The
silence in the room is thick.

                    PETE
          Am I under arrest?

Eldridge glances at Agent Saunders, who stares at Pete
impassively.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Well, no, but these gentlemen would
          like to get some answers...

                    PETE
          I don't know what else to tell you. 
          I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head
          and I didn't remember anything
          until a few days ago.

                    SAUNDERS
          Now that you remember who you are,
          were you planning on telling anyone
          your true identity?

                    PETE
          I already have.

                    SAUNDERS
          Who?

                    PETE
          My girlfriend.  If she still is...

                    SAUNDERS
              (checking his notebook)
          Would that be Miss Sinclair?

                    PETE
              (ironic smile)
          No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm
          talking about Adele Lardner.

Agent Saunders glances at Eldridge.

                    ELDRIDGE
          The doctor's daughter.  She was
          Luke Trumbo's sweetheart.

Pause.

                    SAUNDERS
          Mr. Appleton, I have reason to
          believe you're holding something
          back, and that just rubs me the
          wrong way.
              (pause)
          Sir, are you a communist?

                    PETE
              (firmly)
          No.  Absolutely not.

EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

Pete comes out into the bright midday sun.  It takes a moment
for his eyes to adjust, and when they do, he becomes aware of
perhaps TWENTY PEOPLE lining the sidewalk in front of the
station.

PETE'S POV

We recognize several of the people.  Carl Leffert.  Bob
Leffert and Mabel Lanier.  Daley Thornhill.  Katie
Rutherford.  Stanton Lawson.  Now, there's nothing in the
least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's
what's so disturbing about it.  They're not an angry mob,
they're just standing there, running the gamut of emotions.
Shock.  Disillusionment.  Betrayal.

It's an awkward moment.  Pete doesn't quite know how to
react.  He wants to go over and talk to them, but he wouldn't
know what to say.  He wishes one of them would talk to him,
just say something, anything.  But no one does.

Then, Bob Leffert turns away from Pete.  He shoves his hook
hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away, followed by
Mabel, then his brother, then the others...

... leaving Pete alone.

Mrs. Terwilliger, behind the candy counter, wipes up an

Pete anxiously paces the lobby.  He looks into

THE AUDITORIUM.

Every seat is empty.

He glances at his watch, then turns to Old Tim and Mrs.
Terwilliger:

                    PETE

As Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim silently shamble off, Pete
goes over and flips OFF several light switches.  Most of the

                    PETE
          Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people
          down in L.A. want a piece of me.

He turns to her.

          This Luke was a pretty good guy,
          wasn't he?

                    ADELE
              (wistful smile)
          Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.

                    PETE
          Well... let me tell you, I'm not
          Luke.  I know who I am now, and you
          don't.  And... I don't like me very
          much.

          You know, it's going to take me a
          while to get used to calling you

              (she takes it for a spin)
          Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.

                    PETE
          Thanks, I like it.  I think.

Pause.

                    PETE
          Delly, I want to do the right
          thing.

Pete can't believe he just said that -- but he did.

                    ADELE
          I believe you.

                    PETE
          The truth is, I'm a lot of things,
          but communist isn't one of them.

                    ADELE
          But if you only went to one
          meeting, why does anyone care? 
          Besides, why should it even matter
          if you were a communist?

                    PETE
          Come on, Delly, look at the country
          today.  We're fighting communists
          in Korea, we're paranoid about the
          Russians, we've got this thing with
          the Rosenbergs and the atomic
          bomb...

          communists" entertaining the
          American public with party
          propaganda like, gosh I don't know,
          "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"

                    ADELE
          Forget about all that.  You want to
          do the right thing?  Then defend
          your name.  If someone says
          something about you that's untrue,
          you have to stand up and say so.  I

Pete smiles and puts his arms around her.

There's a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road,
obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away.  It's deadly
quiet as gas station owner RORY, late 60s, pulls up and parks
his Model A truck.  He gets out, and an big old German
Shepherd, LOTTIE, jumps out of the truck bed.

Rory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in the
lock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bank
and sniffing the air expectantly.

                    RORY
          Whatsit, girl?

He stops -- he hears something, too -- a LOW RUMBLE.  Lottie
starts BARKING.  The RUMBLE is getting LOUDER.  Rory's
getting worried.  He looks at

THE FOG BANK.

It's starting to GLOW from within.  Lottie's barking gets
LOUDER and angrier.  Suddenly, a large black car punches out
of the fog bank and tears down the road.  It's followed by
another, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars and
trucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town.

Rory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars fly
past the station.

                    RORY
          Shhhhh.  I know, Lottie.  This

          rules, or they'll ruin you.  And
          they have the power to do it.

                    ADELE
          Doesn't it bother anyone that this
          is a perversion of democracy?

Leo turns to her and smiles.  His tone is charmingly matter-
of-factly, not condescending in the least.

                    LEO
          Darling, don't kid yourself.  We
          don't have a "democracy" in this
          country.  The Declaration of
          Independence?  The Constitution? 
          These are pieces of paper with
          signatures on 'em.  And you know
          what a piece of paper with a
          signature is?  It's a contract. 
          And you know what a contract is? 
          Something that can be re-negotiated
          at any time.  It just so happens
          that the House Un-American
          Activities Committee is re-
          negotiating the contract this time
          around.

Leo takes out a cigarette, lights it.

                    LEO
          Next time, it might be the FBI. 
          The time after that, it might be
          the President.  But it'll always be
          someone.  Count on it.

                    PETE
          That's not the country Luke fought
          for.

                    LEO
          Lest we forget, Peter, your own
          military career was somewhat less
          illustrious than Luke's.

                    PETE
          It's wrong, Leo.

                    LEO
          Peter, don't let that stop you all
          of a sudden.

Leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it to
Pete.

                    LEO
          Here.  When you're called, read
          this to them.  Just tell the
          bastards what they want to hear,
          and we can all get on with our
          lives.

There's a knock at the door.  Leo opens it.  Standing there
is a small MAN wearing a serious suit and an even more
serious fedora.

                    THE MAN
          Peter Appleton?

                    PETE
              (standing)
          You found him.

The Man reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a blue
backed folded document, which he hands to Pete.  As he does,
a FLASH lights the room.

At the door, a pair of PHOTOGRAPHERS and a NEWSREEL CAMERAMAN
are jockeying for position.  Pete rolls his eyes.

                    THE MAN
          Peter Appleton, you are hereby
          subpoenaed to appear as a witness
          before a special session of the
          House Committee on Un-American
          Activities.  You are to appear in
          Los Angeles, California, at the
          Biltmore Hotel, at the date and
          time specified herein.

Pete takes the subpoena.  There's an awkward moment, as the
newsreel camera is still rolling.  Pete cradles the subpoena
like an Oscar statuette and smiles into the lens.

                    PETE
              ("on")
          This is a great honor.  I'll
          treasure this always.  Thank you.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PETE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Pete is sitting in a chair, reading the statement Leo gave
him.

                    PETE
              (softly)
          "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby
          renounce my membership in the
          American Communist Party, and by
          way of purging myself of my
          indiscretion, wish to provide the
          following names of fellow members
          to this committee, so that those
          persons may have the opportunity to
          do as I have done..."

He scans down the page.  It's a long list.

                    PETE
          Jesus...

He HEARS a "meow!" And turns to look.

CAT

is standing in the bedroom doorway.  He folds up and pockets
the list.

                    PETE
          Old Tim?

After a moment, Old Tim appears in the doorway, wringing his
knit cap in his hands.

                    OLD TIM
          Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?

                    PETE
          Sure.  Come on in.  I was just
          packing.

Pete stands, gestures Old Tim to the chair, as he sits on the
bed.

                    PETE
          Please, sit.

                    OLD TIM
          Thanks.

He sits.  Pause.

                    OLD TIM
          They'll come back, you know. 
          They'll all c-c-come back.

                    PETE
          The customers?  I don't know...

                    OLD TIM
          They will.  They w-w-will.

Pete turns to Old Tim, fixes him in the eye.

                    PETE
          Tim, I have to tell you something.

                    OLD TIM
          Oh.

                    PETE
          It's about me.

                    OLD TIM
          Oh.

Pause, as Pete gathers courage and tries to find the words.

                    PETE
          I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. 
          He died in the war.  He's not
          coming back, and I'm not him.  I
          don't even belong here.  This whole
          thing started out as an accident,
          and that's all it is.  An accident.

                    OLD TIM
          Oh...

                    PETE
          My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. 
          Peter Appleton.

Old Tim stands and looks askance at Pete.

Pause.

                    OLD TIM
          Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know
          that?

                    PETE
              (taken aback)
          I thought you...

                    OLD TIM
          I know more than you give me c-c-
          credit, that's for sure.  Don't you
          see, it don't m-m-matter who you
          are?  All that matters is what you
          g-g-gave us.  And you can't take
          that away now.  You're wrong, Peter
          Appleton.  You do belong here.

He leans down to Pete.

                    OLD TIM
          You hafta give us back the B-B-
          Bijou.

Old Tim straightens up, nods at Pete.  Then, silently, he
picks up Cat and exits.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - DAY

Pete and Adele walk slowly down the platform toward the
waiting train.

                    ADELE
          You've got everything?

                    PETE
          Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of
          coming out of this intact.

                    ADELE
          You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo
          Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred
          and seventy-five years of American
          law on your side.  Don't forget
          that.

                    PETE
          I wish you were coming with me.

                    ADELE
          And who's gonna run the projector
          until you get back?  Mrs.
          Terwilliger?

                    PETE
          Maybe we could train Cat to run the
          projector.  You know, a system of
          scratching posts, and gears, and
          levers...

They both smile as the train's HORN blows.

                    CONDUCTOR
          Board!

Pete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passenger
compartment.

                    ADELE
          Did you bring along something to
          read?

                    PETE
          Damn...

Adele pulls a pocket-sized leather-bound book out of her
purse and hands it to Pete.

                    ADELE
          I didn't think so.  Here.  This is
          mine, you can borrow it.

INSERT - THE BOOK

Well-worn and scuffed, nevertheless the title is clear:

             CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
                     ANNOTATED EDITION

Pete looks at the book, then at Adele.

                    ADELE
          Not exactly light reading, I know. 
          Believe it or not, I've read this
          since high school, and it got me
          all the way through law school. 
          Besides, there's something in there
          that'll help you.  You won't have
          to get very far, it's near the
          beginning.

                    PETE
              (clearly touched)
          Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll
          take good care of this.

                    ADELE
          Just remember two things.  First,
          the law is a living thing.  It made
          us free and it keeps us free. 
          Sometimes it gets twisted around by
          people for their own purposes. 
          Sometimes it makes mistakes,
          sometimes big mistakes.  But in the
          end, the law prevails for the just. 
          Sometimes, it takes a while.

                    PETE
          Okay.  What's the second thing?

She thinks for a moment.  She needs the right words.

                    ADELE
          I'll be here... if you come back.

The train pulls out.  Adele and Pete exchange waves as we

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

The House Committee on Un-American Activities has effectively
taken over the Grand Ballroom of this magnificent hotel, and
the joint is packed to the rafters.  Members of the AUDIENCE
crane their necks to see out into the hallway, from where the
witnesses will be entering.

The COMMITTEE MEMBERS are seated at their dais, brightly lit
by the dozens of newsreel and TV lights.  Elvin Clyde is
seated at the far right.  Dead center of the dais is the
Chairman, CONGRESSMAN T. JOHNSTON DOYLE of Wisconsin, a
husky man in his late 50s.  He SLAMS his gavel down several
times and the room goes quiet -- the talking stops, and the
cameras start whirring.

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY

Adele's in a chair, eyes glues to the TV set.  Mrs.
Terwilliger and Old Tim sit on the couch, watching
attentively.

Doc Lardner's in a straight-backed chair at a jaunty angle to
the set, holding the rabbit ears uncomfortably high aloft.

                    ADELE
          That's perfect, Dad.

                    DOYLE (ON TV)
          The committee and the chamber will
          come to order.

Lardner forces a smile at Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim.

                    LARDNER
              (sweating and wincing)
          This television's a grand little
          invention, isn't it?

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

                    DOYLE
          The agenda for this morning's
          special session of the House
          Committee on Un-American Activities
          shows a number of witnesses, and
          I'd like to admonish those that are
          here to view the testimony of our
          first witness to keep order at all
          times, or this chamber will be
          closed.  I'm referring especially
          to the ladies and gentlemen of the
          press.  I hope that's clear.

Beat.  Doyle scans the room.  He clearly means business.

                    DOYLE
          Call Peter Appleton.

All eyes and cameras swing toward the door.

ON PETE

As he enters the chamber, dozens of FLASHBULBS fire as every
eye and every camera follows him silently to his seat.  As he
sits, he glances behind him.

PETE'S POV

Leo Kubelsky is sitting in the front row of spectators.  He
smiles and nods at Pete.

Pete doesn't acknowledge him, and turns back.

                    DOYLE
          The witness will please stand and
          raise his right hand.

Pete does as instructed.

                    DOYLE
          Do you swear that the testimony you
          are about to give before this
          committee of the United States
          House of Representatives will be
          the truth, the whole truth, and
          nothing but the truth, so help you
          god?

                    PETE
          I do.

                    DOYLE
          Be seated and state your full name
          and place of residence for the
          record.

                    PETE
          Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood,
          California.

                    DOYLE
          The chair notes that you are
          appearing without the benefit of
          counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We
          certainly hope this means that you
          intend to be fully forthcoming with
          this committee?

                    PETE
              (faint smile)
          I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.

                    DOYLE
          Now, we're informed that you have a
          statement you'd like to read, is
          that correct?

                    PETE
              (innocently)
          A statement?

Doyle and Clyde exchange glances.

                    DOYLE
          Yes.  A prepared statement.

                    PETE
          Um... no.  I don't have a statement
          at this time.

Pete turns in his chair and winks at Leo.  Leo rolls his eyes
and shakes his head.

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY

Adele breathes a sigh of relief.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          I think he's doing very well, so
          far.

                    ADELE
          They haven't called out the dogs
          yet.

                    DOYLE (ON TV)
          Very well then, the questions will
          be asked by the Majority Counsel,
          Mr. Clyde.

The TV shot swings to see Elvin Clyde.  He puts on his
glasses and fixes Pete with an oily grin.

                    ADELE
          I spoke too soon.

                    CLYDE (ON TV)
          Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank
          you Mr. Appleton, for appearing
          today.

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Appleton, you mention that your
          home is Hollywood, California.  But
          isn't it true that for the last
          several months, you've made your
          home in a town called Lawson,
          California?

                    PETE
          Sir, that is true.

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Appleton, do you know an
          "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"

                    PETE
          Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But
          I'd like to think I know him.

                    CLYDE
          Is that because you were
          masquerading as Luke Trumbo while
          you were in Lawson?

                    PETE
          Mr. Clyde you're twisting things
          around.  I wasn't masquerading. 
          Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man
          who gave his life for his country. 
          I just... happen to look a little
          bit like him.  That's all.

                    CLYDE
              (referring to notes)
          Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was
          reported missing in action and is
          presumed dead.  I also see that you
          were posted stateside during the
          war.  Fort Dix?

                    PETE
          Yes, sir.

                    CLYDE
          Well, I'm sure we're all glad to
          see you came through it all right.

A few spectators titter.

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Mabel and Bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packed
diner.

                    CLYDE (ON RADIO)
          Now, I see that you've been running
          a movie theater in Lawson called
          "The Bijou," is that also true?

                    PETE (ON RADIO)
          Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson
          to run The Bijou, that was... that
          was something that just happened. 
          You see, I was involved in an
          accident in Lawson, and I spent
          some time recovering there.

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

Clyde holds up copies of the Los Angeles Examiner and Los
Angeles Times with Pete's picture on the front page.

                    CLYDE
          Anyone who reads the newspaper is
          quite familiar with your...
          "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An
          accident which, conveniently, came
          hard upon your dismissal from
          United Pictures.  Tell us, this
          "accident" of yours, are we given
          to understand that it affected your
          memory?

                    PETE
          Yes.

                    CLYDE
          And what is the state of your
          memory now?

Beat.  Pete smiles.

                    PETE
          I'm sorry, what was the question?

The audience LAUGHS.  Clyde nods at Pete, forces a tight
smile.

                    CLYDE
          We... appreciate... your little
          note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but
          this is a very serious matter, and
          it merits your fullest attention.
              (back to business)
          That state of your memory now, Mr.
          Appleton?

INT.  WYATT'S HARDWARE - DAY

Avery Wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio.  Spencer
comes around the paint aisle, wiping his hands on his apron. 
He moves to the radio and listens solemnly.

                    PETE (ON RADIO)
          Sir, are you referring to the fact
          that I was suffering from amnesia,
          and I've since recovered my memory?

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

                    CLYDE
              (impatient)
          I'm interested in knowing if you
          remember things you did in your
          past, or if they've been
          conveniently "blotted out" as a
          result of your "accident."

                    PETE
              (smiling)
          Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.

                    CLYDE
          Good.  Good.
              (holds up a piece of
               paper)
          Now, I hold in my hand a
          photostatic copy of the attendance
          roster for the "Bread Instead of
          Bullets Club" of the University of
          California, Los Angeles, dated
          October 11, 1935.  A copy of this
          paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. 
          Do you recognize it?

Pete looks on the table and finds the roster.  He's surprised
to see it.

                    PETE
          Yes... yes, I do.

                    CLYDE
          Referring to line thirty-seven of
          the document, does your printed
          name and signature appear there?

                    PETE
          Yes it does.

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Appleton, please tell this
          committee what was the nature and
          purpose of the "Bread Instead of
          Bullets Club?"

                    PETE
          Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what
          I knew then, or do you want to know
          what I know now?  They're two
          different things?

                    CLYDE
          Start with what you knew then.

                    PETE
          Well, I'd direct the attention of
          counsel and committee to line
          thirty-six of the document, and the
          name printed and signed there.

                    CLYDE
          We see it.  For the record, it
          reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's
          the point of this?

                    PETE
          Well, that's what I knew then.  Or
          who I knew, I should say.  You see,
          I was trying to court Miss
          Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to
          impress her.

                    CLYDE
              (grinning)
          Are you asking this committee to
          believe that you attended a meeting
          of a communist party front
          organization in order to impress a
          girl?

                    PETE
              (slyly)
          Well, if you'd seen Miss
          Angstrom...

The audience LAUGHS.  Doyle BANGS his gavel.

                    PETE
          You asked for the truth.  That's
          the truth.  I had no idea what the
          meeting was about.  I just sat
          through it so I could be near her. 
          I'm sure even a Majority Counsel
          like yourself is familiar with the
          concept of impressing a girl.

The audience LAUGHS.  Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who BANGS
his gavel.

                    DOYLE
          Chamber will come to order.

Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete.

                    CLYDE
          All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was
          what you knew then.  What do you
          know now?

                    PETE
              (takes a deep breath)
          Well, I know that I lost my job
          because of one meeting I went to
          when I was a kid in college.  I
          know that I've been branded a
          communist, which I'm not, but even
          if I was, it shouldn't matter, or
          what do we have a Bill Of Rights
          for?

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Chairman, the witness is being
          non-responsive...

A few members of the audience APPLAUD.  As Pete speaks, their
numbers grow.

                    PETE
              (passionately)
          I know that a lot of good, honest,
          decent people, people that I
          consider my true friends, feel
          betrayed by me, not because of who
          and what I am, but because of what
          you say I am!  I know that I...

Doyle BANGS his gavel several times.  Pete stops and the room
falls quiet.

                    DOYLE
              (emphatically)
          Mr. Appleton, you will respond to
          the questions of this committee
          without elaboration or
          speechmaking, or the chair will
          find you in Contempt Of Congress. 
          You will not be warned again, is
          that clear?
              (he lets this sink in,
               then)
          Continue, Mr. Clyde.

                    CLYDE
              (looking down at his desk)
          Mr. Appleton...

Clyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at Pete.

                    CLYDE
          Are you now, or have you ever been,
          a member of the communist party?

                    PETE
          No, sir.

                    CLYDE
              (holding up the roster)
          Are you refuting this evidence and
          your previous testimony?

                    PETE
          I'm not refuting anything.

                    CLYDE
          Yet you're contradicting yourself. 
          You earlier testified that you
          attended a meeting of a communist
          party-run organization, yet you
          just said, under oath, that you
          were not now -- nor ever -- a
          member of the communist party.

                    PETE
          That's not a contradiction at all,
          sir.  I went to the meeting, but I
          didn't go as a member.

                    CLYDE
          Well, then, as what did you go?

Beat.  Pete smiles.

                    PETE
          I'm a little hesitant to say.

                    DOYLE
          The witness need not be hesitant to
          say anything before this committee,
          as long as it's the truth.

Pete shifts in his chair, then leans into the microphone.

                    PETE
          Well, I went as... a horny young
          man.

The chamber erupts in LAUGHTER.  Even the other COMMITTEE
MEMBERS are laughing, except Clyde and Doyle, who BANGS his
gavel vigorously.

INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Sheriff Eldridge and Daley Thornhill listen to the hearing on
the radio.  They are both laughing at Pete's last comment.

                    ELDRIDGE
          Damn, he don't wanna spar with
          these boys.  They'll eat him alive.

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

The room settles.  Doyle wags his finger accusingly at Pete.

                    DOYLE
              (angry)
          Mr. Appleton, you are making light
          of a legally constituted committee
          of the United States Congress. 
          Believe you me, you do not want to
          incur our wrath.

                    PETE
              (matter-of-factly)
          I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention
          of making light of this committee. 
          And I have no intention of
          incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. 
          I have a few friends who have
          already incurred your wrath. 
          They've sent me letters from jail.

                    CLYDE
              (interrupting)
          Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman, the
          witness is making another speech. 
          I would ask that Mr. Appleton be
          admonished...

                    DOYLE
              (indifferent)
          Mr. Appleton, there is no question
          before you at this time, but I'm
          sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more
          prepared, and if you'd like to
          either answer them or plead the
          Fifth Amendment, we can at least
          get on with the business of this
          committee.

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY

Adele moves to within inches of the TV screen.

                    ADELE
          Tell them Pete.  Tell them...

                    PETE (ON TV)
              (wrestling with this)
          Mr. Chairman, as I understand it,
          the Fifth Amendment pertains to
          self-incrimination, and I can't
          incriminate myself because I've
          done nothing wrong.  Besides,
          incrimination is why you have Mr.
          Clyde working for you.

                    CLYDE (ON TV)
          Mr. Chairman...

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

Clyde is still protesting, but Doyle waves him off.

                    DOYLE
          Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what
          is your intention?

Pete's sweating under the lights.  He's bluffed his last
bluff, and he's on the ropes.  He reaches into his pocket...
and takes out the prepared statement.

INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY

                    PETE (ON TV)
          I... Mr. Chairman, I have a
          prepared statement I'd like to
          read...

ADELE

Her hand goes to her mouth.

                    ADELE
          Oh, Pete.  No...

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

                    DOYLE
          Go ahead, Mr. Appleton.

                    PETE
              (slowly reading)
          "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..."

He stops suddenly.  Pause.

                    DOYLE
          Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?

                    PETE
          I... I need a drink of water.

                    DOYLE
          Go ahead, son.

Pete fills a glass from the pitcher.  Nervously, he spills a
bit, and is splashes onto his coat.  As some of the
spectators chuckle, Pete brushes the water off.  He reaches
into his pocket, and pulls out Adele's copy of the
constitution.  The cover is wet.  He wipes it off and sets it
down on the table.

He takes a sip of water.  Looks at the book.  Picks it up.

Pete's terrified, but in control.  He speaks slowly -- he's
making this up and thinking it out as he goes.

                    PETE
          Mr. Chairman... there's... another
          Amendment... that I'd like to
          invoke at this time, but it's not
          the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if
          you're familiar with it.

                    DOYLE
          Mr. Appleton, you will...

He opens the book and reads, tentatively at first.

                    PETE
          "Congress shall make no law
          respecting an establishment of
          religion, or prohibiting the free
          exercise thereof; or abridging the
          freedom of speech, or of the press;
          or the right of the people
          peaceably to assemble, and to
          petition the Government for a
          redress of grievances."

Pause.  Silence in the room.

ADELE

She's smiling at the TV.  Her eyes are filled with tears.

PETE

He looks up at Chairman Doyle.  Now fully confident.

                    PETE
          That's the First Amendment, Mr.
          Chairman.  It's the backbone of
          this nation.  It's everything that
          gives us the potential to be right
          and good and just -- if only we'd
          live up to that potential.  It's
          what gives me the right to sit in
          this chair and say my piece before
          this committee without fear.  It's
          the most important part of the
          contract that every citizen has
          with this country.  And even though
          this contract...
              (he holds up the book)
          ... the Constitution and the Bill
          of Rights -- even though they're
          just pieces of paper with
          signatures on them -- they're the
          only contracts we have that are
          most definitely not subject to
          renegotiation.  Not by you, Mr.
          Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde,
          not by any member of this committee
          -- or anyone else -- ever.

Pin-drop silence in the room.  Pete scans the faces of the
panel.  All betray anger.

ON LEO

He can't help but smile and nod appreciatively.

                    PETE
          And when you get right down to it,
          that's really all I have to say to
          this committee.  Good morning.

And with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared
statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and
walks toward the door.  The cameras swing with him, and
FLASHBULBS fire like machine guns.  Doyle BANGS his gavel
insistently.

                    DOYLE
          The witness will resume his seat! 
          Did you hear me?!  You are not
          excused, Mr. Appleton!

And then, slowly, APPLAUSE builds in the chamber, reaching a
crescendo as Pete reaches the door and exits.

                    CLYDE
          Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman...!

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY

As Pete exits the hotel, a DOZEN REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS
have him completely surrounded.  FLASHBULBS pop.  He's taken
aback, flustered.

                    FIRST REPORTER
              (seeing Pete)
          There he is!

                    SECOND REPORTER
          Pete!  Are you going back to
          writing pictures?

                    PETE
          I don't know...

                    THIRD REPORTER
          You a commie, Pete?

                    PETE
          No, of course not...

                    SECOND REPORTER
          What about the girl, Pete?  You
          gonna marry her?  Is she coming to
          Hollywood, or are you...

                    PETE
          Look, fellas, I don't have anything
          to say...

Pete is trapped in the crowd, when he feels a hand on his
shoulder.

LEO

spins him around, and pushes him through the crowd toward the
curb.

                    LEO
          Come on, kid.

At the curb is a black Cadillac limousine.  Leo hauls open
the back door and pushes Pete in, before climbing in himself.

The limo drives away, as the reporters give chase.

INT.  LIMO (MOVING) - DAY

Leo and Pete sit side-by-side in silence for a moment.  Leo
breaks it.

                    LEO
          That was quite a show you gave them
          today.  We shoulda sold tickets.

                    PETE
          I'm not sorry for what I said.

                    LEO
          No, of course not, why should you
          be sorry?  You're the new Peter
          Appleton.  You exercised your
          rights as a solid citizen, first
          amendment, freedom of speech, all
          that.  Very noble.

They sit in silence again for a moment until Leo reaches into
his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he
opens and offers to Pete.

                    LEO
          Cigarette?

                    PETE
          No thanks.

Leo takes one for himself and lights up.  Pete takes off his
hat and nervously scratches his head.

                    LEO
          When'd you quit smoking?

                    PETE
          Luke didn't smoke.

                    LEO
          Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. 
          You're Peter Appleton, the picture
          writer.

                    PETE
              (laughs)
          Not any more.

                    LEO
          Why not?

                    PETE
          Leo, you were in there, you saw
          what I did.  You think they're
          gonna let me write pictures?  Hell,
          they're probably gonna throw my ass
          in jail.

                    LEO
              (with a smile)
          Not at all.

                    PETE
          Besides, I don't even know if I
          want to write anymore.

                    LEO
              (snickering)
          What, you're going to go back to
          that hick town and run the
          projector and marry the doctor's
          daughter?

But before Pete can answer...

                    LEO
          Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches
          and get deals made for guys like
          you.  That's what I do.  You're a
          writer.  You write pictures. 
          That's what you do.  And trust me,
          you'll be back doing it again
          tomorrow morning.

                    PETE
          What do you mean?

                    LEO
          Kid, you gave them what they
          wanted.  This committee, it feeds
          on names.  The more names, the
          better.  But for some high-profile
          witnesses, like yourself, any name
          will do.

                    PETE
          Leo, I didn't give them the names. 
          I wouldn't do that.

                    LEO
          What, all of a sudden, "Lucille
          Angstrom" isn't a name?

Pete freezes.  He slowly turns to Leo.

                    PETE
              (warily)
          Her name was right there in front
          of them.  They gave it to me, I
          didn't give it to them.

                    LEO
          Well, that's not what they think.

                    PETE
          Leo, she was... she was a girl I
          knew in college...

                    LEO
          You should keep track of your old
          school chums.  Turns out she
          eventually joined the communist
          party.
              (takes a puff)
          On top of which, she's Lucy
          Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she
          happens to be a writer for "Studio
          One" on CBS.

                    PETE
              (realization dawning)
          Oh god, oh, god, no, I...

                    LEO
          So, our lawyers had a talk with the
          Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin
          Clyde fella won't be too happy
          about it, but we cut a deal. 
          They cleared you -- and they're
          gonna thank you publicly for your
          testimony purging yourself.

                    PETE
          Thank me publicly?  For what?  For
          ruining this woman's life?

                    LEO
              (dismissive)
          Climb down off your cross.  They
          already knew about her.
              (off his look)
          She was subpoenaed six months ago! 
          Who the hell do you think named
          you?

Pete is dumbstruck.  He slumps in his seat, ashen.

                    LEO
              (he couldn't be happier)
          All of which means... "Ashes To
          Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've
          got your job back.
              (takes a puff)
          Congratulations, kid.

Pete's breathing shallowly, on the verge of tears or
screaming -- or both.

EXT.  PETE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The limo pulls up, and Leo opens the door.  Pete vacantly
grabs his suitcase and gets out.  Leo shuts the door and
calls after him, waving Pete's hat.

                    LEO
          Peter!  Your hat!

Pete comes back and takes his hat.  Leo grabs his hand.

                    LEO
          I was lookin' out for you all the
          time, kid.  You did good.  I'm real
          proud of you.
              (to the driver)
          Okay, let's go.
              (to Pete)
          Get some rest, kid!

As the limo pulls away, we

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY

The door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullen
Pete, carrying his suitcases and hat.  He sets them down and
goes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from
the studio have been gathering dust these last three months.

                    SUPER
              (handing him a key)
          Here's a new key for ya.  That Mr.
          Kubelsky, he's got you paid up
          through this month.  You got one
          swell friend there.

The Super moves to the door and turns back.

                    SUPER
          Good to have you back, Pete.

He exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out
the tin-toy fire truck.  Distractedly, Pete puts the toy back
in the box and replies too late:

                    PETE
          Thanks...

He sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat.  As he
does, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat
pocket and falls open to the floor.

Pete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the
inscription inside the front cover catches his eye:

                         TO DELLY,
               THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS.
                         LOVE, LUKE

Pete closes the book.  He thinks for a moment, then glances
over at the phone.  He picks it up and dials "0."

                    PETE
          Western Union, please.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY

Our view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds up
the spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara.  Looking
into one of the train's windows, we SEE Pete sitting, staring
out at the passing scenery.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          Dear Adele, on my way back to
          Lawson STOP.  That is, if they'll
          have me STOP.  Train arrives four
          p.m. STOP.  Hope you can be there
          STOP.  Pete.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON

The train is just pulling in to Lawson.  As it SHUDDERS to a
halt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete
steps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open...

HIS POV

The ENTIRE TOWN has turned out.  They're all there, smiling
broadly.  A large, hand-lettered banner reads:

                     WELCOME HOME PETE!
                   LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON

A CHEER goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence.  Pete
descends from the train and moves into the throng.  The first
two people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier. 
bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smiling
as they shake hands vigorously.

                    BOB
          Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it
          weren't for you, I wouldn't have
          had the nerve to ask this fine
          woman to marry me.

Mabel's mouth drops open.

                    PETE
          Bob, congratulations!  When'd you
          ask her?

                    MABEL
          Holy moley!  Just now!
              (to Bob)
          Yes, Bob!  Yes!

As Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues into
the crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back.

ADELE

is at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front. 
She rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss.  Another CHEER
goes up.

                    PETE
          I see you got the telegram.

                    ADELE
          Pete, I'm so sorry about what they
          did to you.  I didn't think you'd
          come back, I thought you'd want to
          write again...

                    PETE
          Dell, I can't write unless I'm
          happy, and I can't be happy unless
          I'm here -- and with you.
              (grabs her shoulders)
          This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. 
          And I love you!

                    ADELE
              (tears in her eyes)
          And (hic!) I love you, Pete!

They kiss again.  Pete pulls away and looks at his watch.

                    PETE
              (smiling)
          C'mon, Dell, we gotta go.  Showtime
          in fifteen minutes.

The train whistle BLOWS as it slowly pulls out of the
station.

                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
          "Happily ever after" is a relative
          term, folks.  My world is much
          smaller now, and my dreams are very
          different than they were.  But I
          have something now that I never had
          before: I have the magic.  And
          it's for sale at the Bijou, every
          day of the year.  All you need is
          the price of a ticket.

We BOOM UP to see Pete and Adele moving into and being
enveloped by the crowd.

Spencer Wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot
office, and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as we
move up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over the
town, settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijou's
marquee.  The neon chaser lights POP ON, illuminating the
sign, which reads:

                          THE END

Then, the letters on the marquee START SHAKING.  We BOOM UP
TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...

... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...

... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...

... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND...

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

    FADE IN:
1   INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM - NIGHT                          1

    A woman's hands descend to the keyboard of an organ,
    playing the opening chords to a duet from the Bach
    Cantata #78.


2   INT. REHEARSAL ROOM/ANGLE ON LEWIS (LEWIE) DUART            2
    the choral conductor, summoning forth the sound of two
    women's voices singing the text.

                             SOPRANO/ALTO (V.O.)
               'Wir eilen mit schwachen doch
               emsigen Schritten, O Jesu, O
               Meister...' (etc)

    HELEN DEXTRA
    The latter on crutches, a cast on her leg. They stand
    center stage, their texts resting on music stands.
    Seated off to the side, are two male soloists (VINCENT
    GALLARDO & KENNETH DOWLER). Behind them a chorus of
    men and women, waiting, as:


4   INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM/ANGLE ON CONDUCTOR               4
    He begins to sing aggressively over the duet. He
    suddenly drops his hands to his side. The organist
    discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off:

                              LEWIE
               Spruance, would you like to show
               me where it's marked smearing
               here...
                       (hitting at the score)
               ... because I swear, I don't see
               it.

                              JOAN
               Sorry.   I didn't know I was.

                             LEWIE
               Also, I'd be mildly content if I
               could have a little less delirious
               self-appreciation and some small
               regard for remaining somewhere in
               the vicinity of the goddamned note.

    He returns his attention to the score. While Joan
    grumbles to Helen, a late arriving member of the chorus
    (EDDY REVERE) can be seen taking his seat amongst the
    others:
                               JOAN
                 I wasn't smearing.

                               HELEN
                 Sssh, come on now.

                               JOAN
                 No, I'm telling you, this is
                 personally motivated. Since I
                 moved out he's been doing this,
                 making remarks and being...
                 incredibly pricklike...                           *
                               LEWIE
                 Now, if our lovely soprano would like
                 to stop grumbling for a moment, I'd
                 like to take it once again.
                               JOAN
                        (under her breath)
                 See what I mean?
                              LEWIE
              Pardon me?
                            JOAN
              I said fine, let's do it again.
                               LEWIE
                        (with a cold stare)
                 From the beginning please.

    He signals a down beat and they resume somewhere near the      *
    top of the duet.

5   INT. CAMPUS PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING - ON ADELE "IWO JIMA"      5
    WATANABE BLISS - NIGHT

    She speaks emotionally, hoping to solicit sympathy:
                            ADELE
              He never says, 'Honey I love you,
              you're doing a great job.' I
              don't feel he respects me as a
              person and I'm just not that happy
              with the stature of our
              relationship.

                 Uhm hmm.   I hear you.

    ON POST-GRADUATE MFCC THERAPIST

    seated behind a desk in a large deserted classroom:

                               THERAPIST
                 Now I want you to look at Harry
                 and tell him how you feel.

    She turns her gaze to EUGENE EARL AXLINE, alias HARRY
    BLISS. He sits in an adjacent chair, an abject hostage.

    Discomforted by her flinty stare, he glances away, to
    the window where the faint sounds of the CHORAL REHEARSAL
    can be heard.
                               ADELE
                 I feel like he's not plugged into
                 my needs, and I'm not getting
                 enough positive feedback...

    Harry shakes his head, shifting about uncomfortably.
                               ADELE
                 See, look at him shaking his head.

                               THERAPIST
                 Well, let's see what he wants to
                 say here. Harry, how do you feel
                 when she brings out this material?

                               HARRY
                 How do I feel? I feel she just
                 overheats on every little side
                 issue, and when I go to try and
                 communicate with the woman, for
                 some unknown reason she doesn't
                 believe a damn thing I say.

                               ADELE
                 Oh that's a lie.

                               HARRY
                 See what I mean?
                               ADELE
                 No, you know what this whole thing
                 hinges from? He came to rent a
                 building from me which is now his
                 place of business...

                 So what, he's not interested in
                 that, that's not what he's asking.
                        (to Therapist)
                 See what she does? She wants to
                 dig up and haul out miscellaneous
                 things that's got nothing to do
                 with this. I mean, I agreed to
                 come here, okay, but I have to
                 tell you, Iwo Jima's got a lot of
                 faulty notions in her head about
                 me that....
                               ADELE
                 Alright, there. Right now.
                 That's another thing I want to
                 interject...
                               HARRY
                 Pardon me, I was making a
                 statement here.
                               THERAPIST
                 Yes, let's try and hear each other
                 out if we can. Go on, Harry.
                               HARRY
                 Well, I forgot the upshot of what
                 I was saying, but...
                               ADELE
                 Okay, this syndrome where I've
                 asked him to address me by my
                 given name and he just goes on
                 ignoring my wishes.
                               THERAPIST
                 Alright. Look at him and really
                 tell him how you feel about that.
                               ADELE
                 I don't want you to ever call me
                 Iwo Jima again!
                               THERAPIST
                 That's a legitimate request, isn't
                 it?
    Harry begrudges a slight nod.

                               ADELE
                 If you can't call me Adele, don't
                 call me anything at all.

                 So? Can you look at Iwo Jima,
                 Harry, and tell her...
    She darts a confused frown at the Therapist.

                               THERAPIST
                 Better yet, can you take her by
                 the hand and say, 'I hear what
                 you're saying'?

    Reluctantly, he reaches over and takes her hand, mumbling
    something which though indistinct, causes Adele's
    features to pucker with emotion and brings her to the
    edge of tears.

                               THERAPIST
                 Good.  That's good... because
                 there's a lot of love here, isn't

    Joan, moving with nervous alert, approaches a Mercedes          *
    sedan parked next to an Econoline van. Placing her key
    in the lock, she notes a flyer on her windshield. She
    removes it, glancing briefly at this heading in bold
    type: WOMEN - DON'T LIVE IN FEAR. A low RUMBLING sound
    causes her to lift her gaze over the top of the car,
    where an attack shepherd (DUKE), slowly unsheathes his
    teeth and fixes her with a threatening stare through the
    closed window of the van.
    Her eyes drop down to the legend on its door panel:
    House of Bliss Shepherds - Peace of mind - Twenty-Four
    Hours A Day - Call 7-A-T-T-A-C-K.

     A CAR HORN breaks her disturbed reverie and she proceeds
     through the intersection.

      FOLLOWING WITH Joan as she enters the foyer and moves
      along a first floor hallway to her apartment. She turns
      her key in the lock, opens the door, then steps OUT OF
      VIEW.

14    INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              14
      Joan stands briefly in the dark, apprehending something
      untoward. She reaches to a wall switch, turns on the
      lights and sees:

      The living room has been completely savaged. Pictures
      have been pulled from the walls, books have been swept
      from the shelves, chairs are upended and area rugs lie
      rumpled and dislocated. A vase of flowers atop a grand
      piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished
      surface.

      Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden
      patio. The glass pane in one of them is broken and the
      window stands partly open.
      ON Joan's stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the
      room. Then she suddenly reaches to the front door, opens
      it and disappears into the hallway, shutting the door
      after her.


15    INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY                    15
      A detective (MELVENOS) moves about, glancing at the
      devastation. Joan, seated on a couch, addresses him:
      (In the b.g., Helen Dextra stands on her crutches near the
      piano, and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for prints
      around the frame of the broken window.)

                              MELVENOS
                You sure nothing of value has been
                removed from the dwelling?

                              JOAN
                No, nothing. That's what's so
                disturbing. I mean, why would
                someone do something like this...?

                          at some debris
                          on the floor)
                  It kinda looks like somebody
                  doesn't like you, doesn't it?

                  What do you mean, somebody doesn't

                                FINGERPRINTER
                  Not much on the window. A few
                  partials and a bunch of smears.

                  Check out the bedroom.

                  You think this is someone I know?

                  No.

     Helen hobbles INTO VIEW, seating herself in a nearby

                  Not just about him, Joanie, he's
                  only one of many episodes in my
                  life, you know that. Have you got
                  a Perrier?

                                JOAN
                  No, I don't. Let me just call
                  you at home later.
                                ANDY
                  I'm not going to be home. I'm
                  checking into a hospital to have
                  a bone spur removed from my foot.
                  Then I'm going to New York, to
                  meet with a top publisher...
                         (lowering her
                          voice)
                  ... which, incidentally, I would
                  not care for Mr. Redmon, fecal-
                  face Layls to know.

     You know what he said to me?        We're going to be leaving.

                  Wait, I need to talk to you...

     Melvenos and the Fingerprinter step out into the hallway,           *
     with Joan following:

                                JOAN
                  I wanted to ask you, if there's
                  somebody, who for some unknown
                  reason, doesn't like me, what do
                  you suggest I do?

                  I might put some bars on the
                  windows.
                         (giving her
                           his card)
                  My name's Melveny, if you want to
                  get in touch.

                                JOAN
                  Really though, I don't see how
                  this could be somebody I know.

                               MELVENOS
                  Maybe not.

     They start down the hallway and Joan addresses their
     backs:
                                JOAN
                  Because I actually go miles out of
                  my way to avoid conflictual
                  situations.


17   INT. JOAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                                  17
     Helen, now captive to Andy's epic, is seated next to her
     on the couch, attempting to listen politely to a tale
     without an end:
                                ANDY
                  And to top it off, my lawyer said,
                  'Don't worry, they're just pissing
                  into the wind...'
                   HELEN                         ANDY
      Uhm-hmm.                      And I said, they're pissing
                                    into the wind but it's
                                    blowing back in my face...
     Joan has reentered the room and approaches them.

                                ANDY
                  Some help I'm going to get from
                  him, because he's scared to death
                  of Red.

                                JOAN
                  Andy, are you telling me the
                  truth?

                  Wait, I just want you to hear what
                  this colosal shit said about me,
                  through his great white shark of a
                  lawyer.
                                JOAN
                  Pardon me, but I don't care what
                  he said. My apartment, as you can                     *
                  see, is a complete shambles, I have                   *
                  a terrible headache, I've been                        *
                  informed that somebody doesn't like
                  me, and I really don't want to stay

                  Fine, why don't you take my house

     Joan sinks down into a chair, exhausted:

                  Thank you.

18   INT. HOUSE OF BLISS - OFFICE - DAY                            18

     Duke lies on the floor, watching Harry. He stands at a
     cork board on the wall behind his desk, adding a clipping
     announcing the Fourth Victim of a local serial killer
     called the Westside Slasher, to an assortment of other
     items on violent crimes. As he does:

     JUNE HUFF, enters from a door of the rear of the office.
     Moving past Harry's desk, she picks up a folded newspaper
     page, continues to an upholstered bench beneath a window,
     lies down and begins reading.
                                HARRY
                         (moving to his desk)
                  Now don't start lazing around,
                  June. Let's get with it.
                                JUNE
                         (under her breath)
                  You get with it.
     He sits down at his desk and begins going through his
     drawers, looking for something. She lowers the paper
     and looks over at him:
                                JUNE (CONT'D)
                  Do you like my hair this way,
                  or do you like it straight?
                                HARRY
                  It's very nice, Sluggo.   Go hose out
                  the kennel.
     She goes back to reading.

                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  Where the hell are my nail
                  clippers?
     The PHONE on his desk begins to RING:

                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  I told everybody to stay out of
                  these drawers.

                  I think I'll go down to the Amazon,

                  Get this first, will you.

     She gets up and moves over to the desk:
                                JUNE
                  They need people, because that

                  Remember, don't say I'm here 'til
                  you find out who it is.
     She picks up the receiver and speaks into it:
                                JUNE
                  Yeah?... I doubt that he's here at
                  this present time... Yeah, maybe
                  later today sometime... Who are
                  you addressing? Uh, the executive
                  kennel maid... uh-huh. Yeah. Okay,
                  I'll tell him... So long.

     She hangs up.

                  Yeah?   Who was it?

                                HARRY
                  Bastard.

     He goes back to reading. June returns to the bench, lies
     down again and starts grumbling:

                                JUNE
                  You know, you said you were going

      Suddenly irritated, he begins fumbling through a pile                  *
      of bills on top of the desk:

                   get some   adult dogs on the

                   asses are   going to hit the

                   So?    I'm sick of dog turds anyway.
      He scowls at her, then looks out the window:

                   Jesus, here   I am, sitting in the

                   better, and   I'm not turning a
                   damn nickel   on it...

      On the sidewalk beyond it, a man (LEE) stands putting                  *
      coins in a parking meter.

20    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY                            20

      Joan is seated at the piano, playing Ravel's "Reverie."
      She breaks off as she sees a dark young man (BALTO) move
      past the living room window. She resumes playing until
      her attention is once again drawn to the window, where
      a middle-aged Hispanic woman SOCORRO moves past in the
      opposite direction with a young man, who now carries a
      suitcase. She rises and crosses to the windows to see
      them get into a gaudy low-rider and begin backing down the
      driveway.

21    EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - DAY                                        21

      Joan hurries out of the house and runs down the drive-
      way toward the low-rider calling out:
                                 JOAN
                   Socorro!! Wait a minute!   I want
                   to talk to you!
      The Low-Rider comes to a stop. Joan approaches the pas-
      senger window and leans down to Socorro:
                                 JOAN
                   Excuse me, Socorro, but do you
                   mind if I ask what's happening,
                   why are you leaving?
                                 SOCORRO
                   No se, lo siento.

                                 JOAN
                   I'm asking, where-are-you-going?

                                 SOCORRO
                          (indicating Balto)
                   Esto me yerno, Balthazar. You
                   speak please Balto para mi.

                                JOAN
                  Yes, what's going on, are you
                  bringing her back later or what?
                                BALTO
                  Yeah, Monday I bring her back.

                                JOAN
                  Monday? But this is Thursday, I
                  can't stay here alone 'til Monday.

               JOAN                             SOCORRO
     It's my understanding            Si, lunes, lunes.
     that Socorro lived here,
     otherwise, I would've
     made other plans.

                                BALTO
                  Yeah, but she got her time off,
                  too, man, you know.
     Joan straightens up, sighing angrily and looking up at
     the house:

                                JOAN
                  Well, this is just glorious.
     The low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap-
     pears onto the street, Joan moves to an electric box
     atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. She
     presses the button and looks at the gates. They remain
     open. She steps over to the gates and tries to close them
     manually. The locking device fails to engage and a
     portion of it falls off into the bushes.



     ANOTHER ANGLE
     As she leans   down to look for the fallen part,   a pickup
     truck can be   seen parked down the street. The    back of the
     driver's head   (BUTCH GABLE) can be seen and on   the side
     panel of the   truck are the words "Canyon Tree   Surgeons."

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Giving up on the gates, Joan turns and moves with evident
     reluctance up the driveway, passing a three-car garage in
     which her Mercedes and another car hidden under a trap can
     be seen.

     TRAILER MUSIC. Joan is asleep on the bed. Lying beside
     her is a fireplace poker and a mallet meat tenderizer.

     Across the dark room, a trailer of Blood and Kisses plays
     on the TV screen. The scantily-clad woman previously
     seen on the bus stop poster backs away from a steadily-         *
     stalking camera. Her eyes widen in the familiar
     expression of helpless terror and as she opens her mouth
     to scream:
     Joan flinches and sits up. She turns the TV OFF, which          *
     descends into a wooden console. At that moment, there           *
     is a VOICE from outside the bedroom window:
                            BUTCH                                    *
              Hey, Andy!                                             *

     In the vicinity of the bedroom window, a man in work            *
     clothes can be seen pounding on the glass as he continues       *
     yelling:
                            BUTCH (CONT'D)                           *
              It's Butch! Get your ass in gear                       *
              and say hello to your old drinking
              buddy!
     She calls loudly out to him:
                            JOAN
              Andy's not here!
     He moves to the glass facade and peers inside, looking          *
     for the source of the voice:

                            BUTCH
              Well, who are you, honey?

                            JOAN
              She's out of town, and there
              happens to be several other people
              in here trying to sleep, so...

                            BUTCH
              Whyn't you come out and say hello?

                            JOAN
              Will you please go away!?
                            BUTCH
              Come on, stick your head out the
              door an' let's see what you look
              like.

                   I'm sorry, but if you don't leave,
                   I'm going to call the Foothill
                   Patrol.
                                 BUTCH
                   Well, fuck you, honey.

      He cups a hand over his crotch and, sticking his tongue
      out, flicks it in an obscene manner across his lips.

                                 JOAN
                   Tch, where does she find these                         *
                   people.                                                *

                                 BUTCH
                   I was just trying to be nice.
                          (moving backwards
                           to the flower
                           bed)
                   Go ahead an' call 'em, bitch, I
                   don't give a shit.
      He leans down, picks up a dirt clod from the flower bed
      and throws it toward the window:
                                 BUTCH
                   I'll just come back and kick your
                   ass in for you.

      Joan moves along the windows with her weapons in hand,              *
      watching as Butch wavers erratically up to the driveway             *
      where the previously seen pickup can be seen. She                   *
      waits until he gets in and drives off, then she moves               *
      back into the bedroom.

22B   INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT                             22B

      Joan, pacing about in nervous distress. She stops
      abruptly, throws her weapons onto the bed and moves
      purposively to her handbag. Rummaging through it, she               *
      finds the House of Bliss flyer, unfolds it and looks at
      the reassuring photograph of Harry and Duke.

23    EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CLOSE ON DUKE - DAY                       23

      Posed in an alert stance, Duke breaks into a run, loping
      gracefully across the lawn to Harry, where he assumes a
      sitting position upon the command:

                  Always the name first, and then
                  the command.

     She stands off to the side, repeating the command and
     studiously writing it down in a small notebook.

                                HARRY
                  Now, in regard to any   aggressor
                  seeking to give you a   bad time, I
                  want to show you what   you can
                  expect from a dog of   this caliber.

     He takes hold of the dog's muzzle, lifting the lips to
     reveal the large scimitar-like canines:
                                HARRY
                  Here we have the dog's arsenal, so
                  to speak. The animal is trained
                  to apply pressure to specific
                  points of the body until the bone
                  is more or less crushed.
                         (releasing the
                          muzzle)
                  If the attacker is bearing a
                  weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a
                  club, a knife or what-have-you,
                  the dog will, excuse me for
                  saying...
                         ("politely"
                          indicating
                          his crotch)
                  ... automatically go for the
                  testicles.
                                JOAN
                  Oh god, what if I don't want him
                  to do that?
                                HARRY
                  You want him to do that.
                                JOAN
                  No, I just want him to scare
                  someone.
                                  HARRY
                  Believe   me, this will scare them,
                  as well   as incapacitate their mind
                  and any   ability to maneuver
                  against   you.

                                JOAN
                  You know, I have an extremely
                  sensitive reaction to dog dander,
                  so maybe I shouldn't...

                                HARRY
                  Let me ask you something. I like
                  to get a general picture of the
                  individual situation I'm working
                  with.

     He pauses to light a cigarette, making a quick, reflexive
     appraisal of her contours as he does:

                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  Are you married, single, living
                  alone or with some other party?

                                JOAN
                  I'm in the process of a divorce
                  and I moved up here because my
                  apartment was burglarized and...
                         (suddenly
                          mistrustful)
                  But I'm not entirely alone,
                  there's a housekeeper here, and
                  several friends.

                             HARRY
               Well, the hills are hit heaven as
               far as burglaries go. And right
               up on Mulholland is where they
               found the fifth victim of the
               Westside Slasher...

                             JOAN
               No, please, don't tell me about
               that.
                             HARRY
               Believe me, I know what you're up
               against, being an attractive, and
               I take it, unattached woman, such
               as you are...
                      (flicking his
                       cigarettte away)
               But we're going to remedy that
               situation right now, and get you

     He scans the grounds for signs of something we as yet
     know nothing of:

                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  Now let's do a little work with
                  the assailant.

     HARRY

     She holds Duke on a short lead, and as they move along a
     wooded area of the grounds, he leans in close, directing
     her in confidential tones:
                                HARRY
                  Alright now, Joan, give him the
                  command, 'Duke, wachen sie.'
                                JOAN
                  Duke, wachen sie.
                                 HARRY
                  Good.   The dog is now on alert.

     As they walk, Harry glances about, impressed with the
     appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds:
                                HARRY
                  This is really a nice piece of
                  real estate you've got here.
                                JOAN
                         (tense and

                  It's not mine, it's my sister's.

                                HARRY
                  Oh, it's your sister's.
                         (pause)
                  And where's she?

                                JOAN
                         (looking down
                          at Duke)
                  Am I doing this right? Shouldn't
                  I be prepared for something?

                                HARRY
                  Never look at your dog.

                                JOAN
                  Never look at your dog?    Okay.

     They move forward a few feet, when Harry, now slightly
     behind Joan, makes a covert hand signal in the direction
     of some trees several yards ahead of them.

     June, in a padded attack suit, suddenly jumps out from
     behind the trees, assuming an aggressive stance and
     emitting a repertory of menacing sounds.

                            JOAN                       HARRY
          Oh my God!                               Duke, fasse!
     Duke responds immediately, lunging toward June, pulling
     Joan along with him. June screams and starts to run
     away. Harry moves after Joan, yelling ahead to June:
                                HARRY
                  Dammit, June, don't exhibit fear
                  until I tell you!
     Seeing the dog still in pursuit, June ignores the command
     and as Duke continues to tow Joan behind him:
                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  Get him under control now, Joan.
                                   JOAN
                  I am...
                         (struggling
                          with Duke)
                  Good boy, be nice.

                                HARRY
                  Give him the off command!

                                   JOAN
                  I forgot it!     You tell him!   Duke,
                  stop!

     He hurries up behind her, grabbing her around the waist
     to anchor her and addressing the dog:
                                   HARRY
                  Duke, aus!

     The dog instantly assumes a sitting position. Joan, out
     of breath and exhilarated with fear and excitement, turns
     to Harry:

     at the desk making out a check while Harry, in the b.g.,
     takes in a series of photographs on the den wall of some
     of the highlights in the life of Andy Ellerman. (See
     Appendix)

                                HARRY
                  Ordinarily I wouldn't do this,
                  even on a temporary rental basis,
                  because he's the absolute top
                  security and attack dog in the
                  country.

     She lays the pen aside, studying him with evident
     interest as he looks at a photograph of Andy and a man
     on a hunting safari in Africa.
                                HARRY
                  Is this your sister?
                                JOAN
                  Yes, that's her, with her third
                  husband, Eric Ellerman.
                                 HARRY

                  Wait a minute, who's this guy,
                  isn't this Red Layls?

                               JOAN
                  Yes.

                                HARRY
                  No kidding. Your sister's
                  involved with Red Layls? This
                  guy's gotta be one of the five or
                  ten richest men in the country,

                  individual I'd really like to meet
                  sometime.
     He leans in close to a photograph of Andy in a bikini.

                                HARRY
                  Boy, look at that figure. I have
                  to say, your sister is really an
                  attractive looking woman.

                                JOAN
                  Well, that's quite a compliment.
                  I'll have to pass it on.

26   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/FRONT DOOR - DAY                          26

     June, in the b.g., still in the attack jacket, leaning
     sullenly against the van and watching Harry work.
                                HARRY
                  I'll skip back up in a day or two,
                  okay, just to see how you're
                  doing.
                               JOAN
                  Okay.
                                HARRY
                  And Joan, I want you to know, it's
                  been a great pleasure doing
                  business with you.
                                JOAN
                  Oh well...

                          shyly away)
                  ... thank you.

                                HARRY

                  And would you also thank your...
     As she gestures toward June, Harry takes hold of her
     hand, looking earnestly at her:

27   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/HARRY'S VAN - ON JUNE - DAY               27

     as Harry unzips the attack jacket:

                                JUNE
                  You big flirt.

                                HARRY
                  Come on, dumpty, don't start that.
                         (removing the
                          jacket)
                  This is quality clientele. It
                  calls for a certain kind of
                  approach.
                         (nods toward
                          the house)
                  Just soak some of this in, will
                  you?
     He steps past her and goes to the van:
                                JUNE
                         (giving him
                          the finger)
                  Soak this.
     As he opens the back panel:
                                HARRY
                  Start to pattern yourself. Breed
                  up.
                         (tossing the
                          jacket inside
                          the van)
                  Observe the woman, for Christ
                  sakes.

                                  JUNE
                  Oh screw her.
     He closes the back panel and as he moves past her:

                                HARRY
                  You don't screw this type of
                  individual.

                                  JUNE
                  You would.
     On his way to the driver's door:

                   This is the kind of atmosphere we

                          (opening the
                           door)
                   Did she even ask me the cost?
                          (as he
                           gets inside)
                   Dammit, I really respect that.

      ON JUNE
      grumbling as she moves to the passenger door:

      Joan, her mood light-hearted, enters, with Duke
      following. She crosses to the closet, selects a change
      of clothes and moves to lay them out on the bed. Noting
      the message light blinking on her answering machine, she
      steps over to the night-stand, presses the playback and
      to a series of TONES preceding the recorded messages,
      MOVES OUT OF FRAME.


29    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT                          29
      The indistinct sounds of a TAPED MESSAGE OVER: Joan
      turns the tap on in the wash basin and begins splashing
      water on her face. Then as she reaches to a towel and
      turns the tap off, the WORDS of a popular ROCK SONG can
      be heard. Exhibiting some curiosity, she exits the
      bathroom.

30    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT                           30

      Joan stands holding the towel over her   mouth, staring
      down at the answering machine. Issuing    from it, a MAN'S
      VOICE in an eerily whispered falsetto,   singing the words,
      "Every breath you take, Every move you   make, I'll be
      watching you."

     (ABOVE MUSIC FAINTLY OVER:) Once again Joan is stopped
     at a signal. Aware of someone watching her, she turns to
     look through the window.
     A MAN in an adjacent car is staring at her, and
     momentarily addresses her with a peculiar request:

                             MAN
               How about a little smile.
     She quickly faces front and as the light changes,
     accelerates through the intersecion.

     ON DUKE

     He lies on the lawn, secured to the base of a tree by a
     long leash.
     Eddy moves INTO VIEW and stepping over to Duke, leans
     down as though he intends to pet him:

                             JOAN
               Don't do that.

     He turns to see Joan approaching with a paper cup filled
     with water.
                             EDDY
               Don't do what?

                             JOAN
               You're not supposed to look him
               straight in the eye.
                             EDDY
               You have a dog you can't look in
               the eye, Joan?
                             JOAN
               He's not just a dog. He's a
               Schutzhund trained attack dog.

                             EDDY
               Oh...
     He steps back from the dog as Joan leans down to give
     Duke some water from the cup.
                             JOAN
               I was told to avoid a direct gaze
               and always look at the base of the
               right or the left ear.
                             EDDY
               You don't have to go to all this
               trouble, I've offered to stay up
               at your sister's with you?

                             JOAN

                  I'm not stubborn, I'm so
                  accommodating, it's sickening.
     She pats Duke on the head and stands up:

                                EDDY
                  But you won't tell me what's
                  really bothering you. Why don't
                  you confide in me anymore?

                                  JOAN
                  I do.

                  No you don't. Come on, talk to
                  me. Let's go have a drink after

                  Tonight?
     A WOMAN chorus member sticks her head out the stage door:
                                WOMAN
                  Eddy, you better come, he's
                  rehearsing the tenors!

                                EDDY
                  I'm coming...!
                         (then to Joan)
                  How about tomorrow night then?

                                  JOAN
                  I don't know.    Let's say maybe.

                                EDDY
                         (slightly annoyed)
                  Well don't go out of your way,
                  Joan.

     He moves quickly toward the rehearsal room. Immediately
     afraid of his displeasure, she calls after him:

                                 JOAN
                  Eddy?   Tomorrow's fine.   Okay?
     Before disappearing into the studio, he makes a gesture
     acknowledging her capitulation.

      Harry, Joan and Duke following, moves along the glass
      facade, inspecting, then assessing the security status
      of the house:
                              HARRY
                Well, I'd have to say this place                       *
                is a snap to break into.

                               JOAN
                I knew it.   I shouldn't have moved
                here.

                              HARRY
                Don't worry. The dog'll take care                      *
                of anyone trying to get inside.

      She moves down into the living room, crossing toward one
      of the couches, with Harry following:
                              JOAN
                I don't know what to do. Maybe I
                should move into a motel.
                              HARRY
                No, you don't have to do that.
                This is just some ding-dong that's
                trying to scare you.
                              JOAN
                Well he's succeeded.
      She sits down.
                              HARRY
                But you don't want to give off
                that impression, by acting too
                timid or afraid, because that's
                what invites an aggressive
                attitude from certain types of
                men.                                                   *

                I didn't invite this.                                  *
                                                                       *

               For instance, don't go mincing                          *
               along, taking mousey little steps,
               and waving your hanky, because                          *
               you're drawing a target on
               yourself if you do...

                                 HARRY
                   Well, let's see. Just walk back
                   and forth the way you normally do.
                                 JOAN
                          (stands up)
                   Well I don't normally walk back
                   and forth, but... okay.
      She attempts a few steps then stops abruptly:

                                 JOAN
                   I'm sorry, I can't do it with
                   you watching me.

                                 HARRY
                   Okay, but keep in mind that you
                   want to exhibit a very confident
                   attitude. Look like you know what
                   you're doing and where you're
                   going.
                                JOAN
                   Uhm-hmm.
                                 HARRY
                   Just remember to stop short of
                   appearing a little dykey, because
                   that's not attractive.
                                 JOAN
                   But I thought that's your point,
                   no to attract...

                                 HARRY
                   No, no, you always want to remain
                   a little bit attractive. Otherwise
                   that can set somone off too.
                                 JOAN
                   This is just impossible.

      She moves back to the couch and sits down.
                                 JOAN
                   You just can't win.

                                 HARRY
                   Sure you can, it's just a matter
                   of degree.

                                 JOAN
                   Well darn it, I give up...
      Dropping her head into her hands.

      He sits down next to her:

                   Tell you what. Let me take you

     second glass of wine, is not unaware that Harry is looking
     at her:

     He lights a cigarette. As she reaches to her glass, his
     eyes follow the motion of her hands. She looks in
     front the window:
                             JOAN
               How long have you been divorced?
                             HARRY
               Oh, I'd say seven or eight years,
               around there.

                              JOAN
               And so you  like, well, assuming

               mean most  men don't seem to enjoy
               that, I've  read.
     She lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back
     down:
                              HARRY
               I have to  tell you the truth...
                      (he  pauses)
               I've been  observing your hands, and
               I have to  use the word exquisite.

      and nearly knocks    it over, spilling a bit of wine onto
      the tablecloth and    is relieved to find him gazing off
      and unaware of her    gaffe.

                   You're probably quite a singer too.

                Yes, anytime. Do you like
                Classical music?

                              HARRY

                that when it's playing on the
                radio, I sometimes have to turn
                the damn thing off.
      Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit,

                I'm sorry.     I shouldn't have
                laughed.

                              HARRY
                Yeah, symphonies, operettas,
                poems, things like that. All
                those type of things really get to

      response to Harry:

      has gone down and the lights of the city have come on.

      fence railing off an Oriental garden.
                             JOAN
               You know, it's very sad. I look
               at my sister and all her marriages
               and affairs, not to mention the
               mess my own life is in, and I
               think it's very sad and very bleak
               that men and women can't manage to
               be friends.
                             HARRY
               It depends on the man and woman
               you're talking about.
      They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one
      of her hands on the railings:
                             JOAN
               What a tragedy that sex is often
               such a barrier to friendship
               between men and women.
                             HARRY
               There I disagree with you.

      He places his hand over hers. She remains silent a
      moment, restraining her response to the gesture. Then:
                             JOAN
               You know Dante and Beatrice never
               slept together.
                             HARRY
               Is that right?
                      (catching himself)
               Oh yeah, I forgot that part.

                             JOAN
               Well, anyway... I shouldn't have
               had so much wine... because I
               prefer to go a little slow here.

                             HARRY
               We can go as slow as you want...
               why not?

39    EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/FRONT YARD/DRIVEWAY - DAY                39

      Joan, accompanied by Duke, moves down the driveway to
      a mailbox in front of the broken gates.
      She pauses to lavish the DOG with an exuberant display of
      affection and finds herself intimidated as he responds by
      leaping about and BARKING joyously:
                                 JOAN
                   Alright now, don't play too rough.
      The excitement has unleashed Duke's libido and as she
      tries to resume her mission, he makes a few attempts to
      rise against her flanks. Just before she approaches the
      mailbox, he manages to grip his paws around one of her
      thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her:
                                 JOAN
                   No, no, Duke, don't do that,
                   that's not nice. Now sitz. And
                   behave yourself.
      He sits, panting, with a furtive expression on his face,
      watching as she steps over to the mailbox and opens it.
      She takes out a number of letters and sorts through them
      as she starts back to the house with Duke following.
      They are in the main addressed to Andy, but in amongst
      them she finds a bank statement addressed to her, as well
      as a letter with her name written in pencil on the
      envelope. She opens it, takes the contents out and stops
      suddenly:

      CLOSE ON JOAN'S HAND

      holding a woodcut with a foxed edge revealing it was torn
      from the pages of a book. It is of a woman kneeling with
      her head on the block, while above her a hooded
      executioner stands with an ax in his hand.

40A   EXT. CAMPUS CONCESSION AREA - DAY                           40A

      Joan and Helen, seated at a table near the concessionary
      building. The latter sits, tense and disturbed, an
      uneaten sandwich in front of her, as Helen reads from a
      list of suspects. (Lewie can be seen at another table,
      seated across from a bearded man. The other members of
      the Chorale, including the male soloists, are variously
      seated, moving about, or lounging on the campus lawn,
      having their lunch.)

                               HELEN (CONT'D)
                'Lewie.   Mad at me.'

      The CAMERA PERUSES Lewie.

                              HELEN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Doesn't want a divorce. Maybe
                he's trying to scare me, or punish
                me.
      Helen leans her head in close to Joan's:

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                It's definitely not Lewie.
                              JOAN
                You're not exactly a disinterested
                party. You're always promoting
                his cause...

      one of the members of the female chorus:

                one, who happens to be post-

      Helen returns to the list, tapping her finger on one of

                   use it to...

41    INT. CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM - NIGHT                              41
      Joan and Lewie stand in the doorway of the      rehearsal
      room. (A portion of the Chorus Membership       are seated in
      chairs, and some, including Eddy Revere and      Helen, show
      occasional interest in the intense exchange      taking place
      at the door:)
                                 LEWIE
                   I'm extremely concerned about
                   this situation. I don't want you
                   living alone up there.
      She regards him suspiciously. He modulates his voice to
      a more persuasive and intimate tone:
                                 LEWIE
                   Now come on, wouldn't you feel
                   much safer if you moved back into
                   our house?
                                 JOAN
                   No, I wouldn't feel comfortable
                   about doing that.
                                  LEWIE
                   Come here...

      He takes hold of her arm and moves her out into the hall:
                                 JOAN
                   Darn it, Lewie.

                  What? Are you afraid of your

                  shitty circumstances I'm dealing

                                LEWIE
                  Do you know how hard all this has
                  been on me? Do you think it's
                  that easy for me to admit I want
                  you back?
                                JOAN

                  Are you seeing anybody?   Just tell
                  me that.

     She rolls her eyes, sighing impatiently.
                                LEWIE
                  Come on, you're not the abstinent
                  type.
                                JOAN
                  Please, don't judge me by your
                  scrotal excesses, Lewie.
                                LEWIE
                  I know you're seeing somebody.

                          again)

                                LEWIE
                  Come on. Be open about it.
                         (kisses her
                          on the neck,
                          then)

     Her gaze meets Helen's, who, misconstruing the situation,
     makes an "OK" sign, delivering her semiotic sanction to
     the happy reunion in the hallway.
                                JOAN
                         (back to Lewie)
                  Alright, I am seeing someone,
                  okay?
     He pulls back, narrowing his eyes at her:

                                LEWIE
                  I don't believe you.   Who is it?

42   INT./EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  42

     Outside Joan and Harry dine. The patio is lit only by
     candles on the table. Socorro enters the living room
     with a tray holding a coffee urn and cup and closely
     tailed by Duke. She moves toward the patio.


43   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/PATIO - NIGHT                                 43
     Socorro sets the tray down and departs for the kitchen
     with Duke again falling in behind her.
     Joan begins to pour their coffee, glancing inside the
     house to see...
     Socorro turning lights out while the indefatigable Duke
     tries to mount her. Uttering some impatient complaint,
     she swipes at him with a napkin and the two move OUT OF
     VIEW THROUGH the kitchen door.
                                JOAN
                  You know, I hate to mention this
                  but we're having a slight problem
                  with Duke.

                               HARRY
                  What?
                         JOAN
                  Well...
                         (hands him
                          a cup)
                  He keeps getting up and trying to
                  ride on one's extremities.

                  Oh don't worry about that.

                   speak English, let alone  German,
                   and sometimes she has to  go
                   pulling him from room to  room
                   like a vacuum cleaner.

                                 HARRY
                   No, that's just normal in most of
                   your adult males. Some percentage
                   of the time they're gonna attempt
                   to make these vulgar motions on
                   your person.
      He places his arm on the couch behind her:

                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                   You just have to be very firm and
                   stay on top of him.
      In the sky beyond the hills a helicopter beams its light.


43A   INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (SOME TIME LATER)         43A
      Joan and Harry   are seated on the couch having coffee as             *
      they listen to   a CHOPIN NOCTURNE. He is doing his best              *
      to emulate her   posture of thoughtful intensity as she
      listens, but as   he steals a look at her his adult male
      impulses causes   him to shift about slightly. She looks
      over at him:
                                 JOAN
                   It's not affecting you too much,
                   is it?
                                 HARRY
                   No, it's very nice.
                                 JOAN
                   It's Chopin, a nocturne.

                                 HARRY
                   You know what's affecting me?

                                 JOAN
                   Night-piece, it means.
                                HARRY
                   You are.

      He reaches over and runs his hand slowly down her back.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 JOAN
                   I think I should say something.

                                 HARRY
                   Don't worry about it.

                                 JOAN
                   That's the problem though, I want
                   to be honest with you...
                                 HARRY
                   There's no problem.
      He leans over and kisses her.      After a moment she breaks
      off:

                                 JOAN
                   Because I recently realized
                   something about myself. That I've
                   slept with a number of men in my
                   life just because I didn't want
                   them not to like me.
                                  HARRY
                          (not averse to
                            being one of
                            them)
                   Uhm hmm.

                                 JOAN
                   But the thing is, I didn't like
                   most of them that much, so why did
                   I care whether they liked me or
                   not?
                                 HARRY
                   You know, I'm not one of these
                   guys who's going to look upon you
                   as an object.
                                 JOAN
                   Oh, I know, that's not what I'm
                   saying...
                                 HARRY
                   Because I look upon a woman as a
                   whole.
                                 JOAN
                   What I'm saying is I don't know if
                   right now I might not go to bed
                   with you because I don't want to
                   be alone, so I thought maybe we...
                   could try to explore other modes,
                   or...

                                 JOAN
                   I mean, there are other ways of
                   being intimate, that people don't
                   even realize.

                                  HARRY
                   Uhm hmm.

                                 JOAN
                   Which doesn't mean I'm not
                   attracted to you.

                                 HARRY                                     *
                   But you don't want me to bring you                      *
                   around.                                                 *

                                 HARRY
                   Other modes is fine. You don't
                   have to be shy with me.
                          (moving closer
                           to her)
                   I've been asked to do do every
                   kind of thing in the book.
      He kisses her once more. Her response, is far less
      tentative. As it begins to border on the ardent, she
      breaks off again:

                                 JOAN
                   God, it's so hard to pioneer in this
                   area... when you keep doing
                   that...

      Joan and Harry tussle about with abandoned fervor under
      the covers of the bed. A fire is burning in the
      fireplace. Presently, the PHONE RINGS, followed by:

     The BEEP is followed by Andy's voice, in some waning
     stage of sedation, coming from the phone speaker:

                                ANDY (V.O.)
                  Joan?  It's Andy... Are you there?
                         (pause)
                  I want to inform you that these

      Andy, speaking covertly into a telephone. She wears a
      hospital smock and is seated on the edge of bed occupied
      by a woman in a drug-induced state of oblivion.
                             ANDY
               There's no phone in my room, or
               cable TV. I've had to sneak into
               this cell next to me, with some
               poor lithium zombie lying here
               like a comatose cabbage...


44B   INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - BACK TO HARRY AND JOAN           44B
      her expression shows some concern:

                             JOAN
               Maybe I better take this.
      She tries to move closer to the phone, hindered by
      Harry's weight.
                             ANDY (V.O.)
               And this is the lengths this
               assassin is willing to go to
               suppress me, because he does not
               want me to have my book.
                             JOAN
               Harry, excuse me, it's my sister.
      He moves off of her and she leans across his torso,
      pinning him to the bed as she addresses the speaker:

                             JOAN
               Andy... It's Joan.

               No, that's what I'm telling you.
               I went into the hospital first,
               for one day, just to have a simple
               bone spur...

                   I know, you told me that, but
                   where are you now?

                   else, against my knowledge, while
                   I was completely medicated...

                   Do you understand the implications
                   of this, I have no underpants on,
                   and absolutely no recourse to my
                   rights!
      Joan sits up, and in her alarm is unaware that one of her
      hands grabs hold of a swatch of hair on Harry's chest,
      causing him to wince:
                                 JOAN
                   Oh God, this is because of Red,
                   isn't it?
                                 ANDY
                   Yes, it's because of Red, isn't
                   that obvious!?
      Evidencing interest in their exchange, Harry manages to
      reach to his cigarettes on the night stand.

                                 ANDY
                   And if he and that fuckface lawyer
                   in his paid employ, think they can
                   ... Wait.
                          (whispering)
                   I think I hear someone.

      Joan turns to Harry, a stricken look on her face:
                                 JOAN
                   What am I supposed to do?

                I'm in some private cracker box in

                ... because I'm sure there's some
                simple explanation...

      She is cut short by the abrupt sound of the PHONE HANGING
      UP on the other end. Again, she turns to Harry:

                              JOAN
                What should I do? Should I call
                the police?
                             HARRY
                No.

      He reaches to an ashtray on the night stand and quickly
      douses his cigarette:

                   Let's just take a run out there.

      ON JOAN

      hesitant and fearful:

                                 JOAN
                   You mean right now?

      as Joan's car creeps along on a Saturday night Freeway,
      bottling up a line of cars behind.


45    EXT. FREEWAY/INT. JOAN'S CAR - NIGHT                       45
      Harry is none too happily confined to the passenger seat
      as Joan, white knuckling on the wheel, obsesses on Andy:
                                 JOAN
                   I told her she shouldn't do this,
                   I mean, to be so maniacally
                   obsessed with this soul of mud
                   that she'd even want to write
                   a book about him, is beyond me...
                                 HARRY
                   Well the guy must be doing
                   something right to have amassed
                   that amount of wealth.
                                 JOAN
                   But she does this, you know, she
                   just periodically drops the entire
                   weight of her life on me like a
                   ton of bricks.

                                 HARRY
                   Joan, can I make a suggestion?
                                 JOAN
                   Yes, please, anything.

                                 HARRY
                   You better try an keep up a little
                   with the flow or we're gonna get
                   cited.

46   INT. MOUNT HAVEN HOSPITAL/RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT          46
     Harry stands scowling for effect, his arm around Joan.    A
     MALE ADMISSION'S CLERK sits at a computer behind a
     counter, keying up a file, then reading if off the
     screen:
                            A.C.
              Ellerman, Antonia. She was
              admitted on the third of the month
              and was signed out at 3:45 P.M. on
              the fourth, by her personal
              physician...

                            JOAN
              How do you know he was her
              physician?

                            HARRY
              Hell, I could come in here and say
              I was a doctor an' sign somebody
              out.
                            JOAN
              And even if he was a doctor, it
              doesn't mean he was my sister's
              doctor.
                            A.C.
              According to this he was her
              doctor.
                            JOAN
              Then who was the doctor who
              operated on her foot?

                            A.C.
                     (looking at
                      screen)
              There's nothing on here about her
              foot. It says 'observation for
              clinical depression.'

                            JOAN
              That's a lie. She was in here for
              an operation, then she was drugged
              and taken out of here against her
              will.

                            A.C.
              That couldn't possibly happen, we
              have very strict regulations
              about...

                  Okay, let's stop wasting time
                  here, where is this guy, what's

                         (looking at
                          the screen)
                  His name is Dr. Monroe Park.
                         (back to them)
                  It doesn't say where he is.

                                JOAN
                  I can't believe this, you mean
                  there's no phone number or
                  address?

                                A.C.
                  I'm sorry, but I didn't type this

                  All I can do is give you the data
                  I have on here. If you want to

                  There's some public phones over
                  there. He's probably listed with
                  them.
     He turns away from them and back to the computer.

     Joan wanders anxiously around the waiting room. In the
     b.g., Harry can be seen at one of the pay phones. Seeing
     him hang up, she stops pacing and looks toward him.

     POV: He approaches, answering her expectant look with a
     shake of the head and the disheartening news:
                                 HARRY
                  Nothing.   No Dr. Monroe Park.

     Harry and Joan, moving toward the hospital parking lot:

                            JOAN
              How am I supposed to find this
              man? Maybe he used a false name,
              or maybe he isn't even a doctor...

                            HARRY
              I've got a couple of ideas here.
              First, we want to try an' connect
              with Red Layls.

                            JOAN
              No, I don't want anything to do
              with Red, I'm terrified of him.

                            HARRY
              There's nothing to be afraid of,
              believe me.
                            JOAN
              I mean, you hear all kinds of
              things, about government
              kickbacks, and Panamanian drug
              couriers and...
                            HARRY
              I know these type of guys. You
              take away their money and their
              power, and what are they.
                            JOAN
              No, really, I have to do
              something. I have to go to the
              police...
     He stops walking and takes a hold of her hand:

                            HARRY
              Just hold off a bit on that,
              honey, will you?

                            JOAN
              Oh, that's nice.

                            HARRY
              What?
                            JOAN
              You called me honey.

                            HARRY
              Well that's what you are.

                  I want to get a hold of this top

                  Harry, this isn't your problem and

     glass window, reading   the above paper. The view is
     inclusive of The House   of Bliss across the street.
     He lowers the paper as a waitress (VITA) appears with a

                  No, it's not what you think. This
                  is a very unique individual I'm
                  talking about. Plus there's a
                  mind there, as well as a body and

     Presently, the passenger door opens and L.N. MONCRIEF, a
     barely discernible presence in a suit blending in with
     the dark interior of the car, addresses him by name:
                                MONCRIEF
                  Mr. Bliss, I'd like to have word
                  with you, if I may.

     Bliss, looking at Harry and as he disappears into the
     car, she turns and goes inside the building.

     The CAMERA makes a SLOW CIRCUIT around the Continental,
     taking in an aerial protruding from the trunk, and below
     it a license plate with the word "TYPHON" on it. The                *
     MOVE CONTINUES, briefly SCANNING a driver with a nasty
     recidivist face, seated behind the wheel, and as we come
     full circle, the passenger door opens and Harry gets out.
     He slams the door and steps back, angrily glaring at the
     car. The hydraulic window opens and Moncrief looks out
     at him:
                                HARRY
                  You're talking to the wrong
                  godammed party, you know that?

                                MONCRIEF
                  I think it's in your best interest
                  to hear me out.
                                HARRY
                  No, you hear me out, friend...
     He takes note of the driver (STURGE) coming around the
     front of the car. He stops a few feet off and unbuttons
     his jacket, revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder
     holster.

     Harry steps over to the window, leans down and
     communicates in more politic tones:
                                HARRY
                  Look, I happen to have a very
                  high regard for this party. And
                  maybe I even have some feelings of
                  a personal nature here.

                                MONCRIEF
                  Well I don't want to appear to be
                  taking unfair advantage of you...

     Moncrief reaches into a briefcase, takes out a folder and
     makes reference to its contents as he speaks:

                                MONCRIEF
                  But in developing certain
                  information on you, it's come to
                  our attention that your name isn't
                  Harry Bliss. That in fact, your
                  name is Eugene Earl Axline...

                  And that both the I.R.S., and an
                  impressive number of creditors in

                  ... seem to be somewhat interested
                  in your whereabouts.
     Harry stands up, leaving the vulnerable area of his
     stomach framed in the passenger window. When he leans
     back down, a deeply conflicted expression is apparent on
     his face:
                                HARRY
                  You know, that's not necessarily
                  entirely accurate, I mean, I don't
                  know where you come up with these
                  so-called facts, but...
                         (at a loss,
                          he looks
                          off, shaking
                          his head)
                  I can't go sneaking around,
                  stealing this lady's property.

                                MONCRIEF
                  I'd like to pose that the name
                  and reputation of this very
                  decent man, is not the property
                  of Mrs. Ellerman, or her sister.                       *
     He takes a voucher from the folder and sets the file
     aside:

                  confiscate this document. And if

     He holds the voucher out to Harry who avoids looking at
     it:

                  Jesus Christ, I hardly know the
                  woman. I'm just renting a dog to

                          (looking at
                           Moncrief)
                  What kind of a person do you take
                  me for?
     Harry stands in the parking lot, watching as the Con-
     tinental drives off. He starts to move toward The House
     of Bliss, then stops and opens the voucher, braving a
     look at it.

53   EXT. STREET (PERPENDICULAR TO ANDY'S HOUSE) - DAY             53

     Joan's car pulls onto the street leading to Andy's house.
     Her gaze is drawn to a pickup parked on the street and,
     as she passes the vehicles she turns to look at:

     sits in the pickup. A pile of recently-trimmed tree
     branches litter the ground near the truck. He turns his
     head to look at her.


54   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY - DAY                             54
     Joan gets out of    the Mercedes and opens the gates. As
     she moves back to    the driver's door, she glances at
     Butch, then gets    quickly into the car. She drives in
     through the gates    and once again gets out to close them
     behind her.


     ON BUTCH
     He watches sullenly as her car disappears through the
     gates, then lifts a can of beer to his mouth and drinks.

55   INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DEN - DAY                                  55

     Joan searches through the file cabinets and not finding
     what she's looking for, goes through a similar course
     of procedure with the desk drawers.


     ANGLE - UPSTAIRS
     On an upstairs landing, she searches through some drawers
     and cupboards. Then spotting Socorro on the level below:

                                JOAN
                  Oh, Socorro...


     ANGLE PAST JOAN TO SOCORRO BELOW
                                JOAN (CONT'D)
                  Could you come in here, por favor?
     As Socorro comes to the landing, Joan indicates one of
     the open desk drawers:

                                JOAN
                  I-am-looking-for-my-sister's-book.
     Socorro steps closer and glancing into the the now
     disorderly contents of the drawer, shakes her head
     defensively:
                                 SOCORRO
                  No.   No es mi.

                   Lo siento...

      Continuing to mumble some disclaimer, she moves out into
      the hallway and disappears.


55A   INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY         55A
      Joan rifles through the drawers of a small escritoire
      against the back wall of the bedroom. Then she moves
      toward the dressing area giving off to the bathroom, and
      stops as she sees the top rung of a ladder just visible
      above the bottom ledge of a window adjacent to the shower.
      A small section of glass has been removed, just large
      enough to permit the entry of hand to the window lock.

      Harry behind his desk, irritable, avoiding eye contact
      with Joan, who is seated across from him on the window
      bench. (See Appendix for new items, visible on the crime
      collage behind Harry.)

                  I told this detective I wanted to
                  press charges against Red Layls,
                  for abducting Andy, for
                  burglarizing my apartment, for
                  breaking into her house...

                                HARRY
                  Oh come on, you're way off.
                                JOAN
                  And that he's been trying to scare
                  and intimidate me in case I might
                  have read something in her
                  manuscript that he doesn't want
                  anybody to know. And you know
                  what he said? That I haven't
                  given him probable cause to even
                  go and question Red Layls, or his
                  lawyer...
                                HARRY
                  Well, he's right, I could've told
                  you that. This is a man who goes
                  fishing with the President, honey.

                          cigarettes)
                  He's a little high up to go around
                  burglarizing people and sending
                  them nasty notes. So why don't
                  you just ease back on this thing
                  for awhile...

                  Life's too godammed short.
                                JOAN
                  I can't do that, Harry. This is
                  my sister. I can at least make
                  out a missing persons report on
                  her, and then I want to talk to
                  the private detective friend of
                  yours.

                  Well, someone abates your
                  maidenhood and suddenly feels
                  they can start ordering you
                  around.
                                HARRY
                  I'm not ordering you around. I'm
                  just giving you my opinion. And
                  maybe I get tired of hearing about

                  business, this manu-whatever, and
                  Red Layls, and your sister.

                  I'm sorry if I've overtaxed you
                  with my problems, Harry, but I
                  never asked you to consider them a

                  So why don't we speak when you're

      going out the door. Harry moves to the window, unhappily
      watching as Joan gets into the Mercedes and drives off.


      ON HARRY
      again seated at his desk. He stares out the window, in
      the throes of a moral conflict. Then making some sudden
      resolve he opens a drawer, takes out an envelope and a
      paperback book and lays them on the desk.


      CLOSEUP ON PAPERBACK
      The price sticker is still attached above the title:
      Dante's Divine Comedy - Simplified Edition. He opens the
      book, removes the Typhon voucher from between its pages
      and begins addressing the envelope with the information
      on the check. Then he puts the voucher into the envelope
      and seals it.

      the block from his building. He approaches a mailbox,
      pulls the handle on the letter drop and inserts his hand
      inside the chute. He holds it there a moment, seized by
      indecision, and then brings his hand back out, still
      holding the envelope.
      Turning around, he angrily stuffs it into his back pocket
      and heads back to the House of Bliss.

      Joan, carrying two glasses of beer, crosses to exit the
      kitchen, the ubiquitous Duke trailing after her. She
      pauses to address Socorro, at the service island,
      vigorously hacking at the pink cadaver of chicken and
      tossing the dismembered pieces into a stewing pot:

                                 JOAN

      Duke returns to the kitchen and Joan moves into an enter-
      tainment alcove off the living room. Helen is seated on
      a couch, eating a slice of pizza from a delivery box on
      the coffee table, her attention on the TV, where a talk
      show is in progress:

                   So let's give them a nice warm

      solicitous HOST addresses the     DIRECTOR. Seated beside
      him is the Actress previously     seen on the billboard and
      in the movie trailer of Blood     and Kisses.)
                                 HOST (V.O.)
                   Before we begin, why don't we show
                   the audience a clip from the movie.
                   Do you want to set it up for us?
                                 DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                   Well, it's a bit... this scene
                   involves... just go ahead and run
                   it.

      After clip:
                                 HOST (V.O.)
                          (to the Director)
                   I must say, this is a dazzling
                   piece of work and you two are a
                   dynamite wedding of talents...

      Joan hands Helen one of the glasses, then sits down
      beside her. Under the following, she picks up a pen and
      leans over the police document now resting on the coffee
      table.

                   But I hear you're a little   sensitive
                   about the criticism you've   had
                   about the amount of sexual   violence

                   Well it's absurd. In the first
                   place, I didn't invent this genre.
                   And it happens to be a tradition
                   in this kind of film that women
                   make more interesting and exciting
                   victims than men do...
                                 HOST (V.O.)
                   Well, I understand...
      She looks up from the document to the screen. Then both
      women look at each other with their mouths open:

                                 DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                   And secondly the violence directed                      *
                   at Mimi's character is an essential
                   component of the story, and is not
                   in any sense of the word,
                   gratuitous.

      ON TV SCREEN

      as the Host turns to the Actress:
                                 HOST (V.O.)
                   But, Mimi, now what about you.
                   That scene where you run nude
                   through Times Square with those
                   multiple knife wounds all over
                   your body. That must've been
                   horrendous for you.

      ON JOAN

      as she throws the pen down onto the coffee table:
                   JOAN                          ACTRESS (V.O.)

       June, lying on a studio couch with a remote control in
       her hand, looking at the Actress:

                                  ACTRESS (V.O.)
                    ... and that scene came directly
                    after the gang rape in the
                    elevator.
       Harry steps INTO VIEW, only half-listening and grumbling:

                    What's her problem.

X64   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT                             X64

      Joan and Helen enter the garage. Joan gets into the
      driver's seat and closes the door, while Helen maneuvers
      on her crutches around to the passenger side.


      ANGLE INSIDE JOAN'S CAR
      Joan turns the IGNITION ON and as she starts to buckle
      herself in, her eye catches the movement of something at
      the back of the garage.

                                                              68.

      From behind a sheet of    plywood resting against the back
      wall of the garage, and    just visible in the darkness, a
      man's hand can be seen    reaching to the handle of an ax in
      amongst other gardening    tools in an iron rack.
      Helen opens the passenger door and Joan whispers to her:

                                 JOAN
                   Helen, quick, get in the car!
      Helen leans down and looks in at her:

                                 HELEN
                   What?

      Looking in the   direction   of Joan's gaze she sees the dark
      figure of a man   wearing a   hood over his head, stepping
      out from behind   the sheet   of plywood, holding the ax in
      his hand and as   he moves   toward the front of the car, she
      screams.
      He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio-
      lently, cleaving the blade into the hood of the Mercedes.
      (From inside the house, DUKE can be heard BARKING
      furiously.)
      Joan leaps from the car and in stark terror, runs out of
      the garage toward the house. Stopped by the sounds of
      HELEN'S HYSTERIA, she turns around to see her, hampered
      by her crutches and unable to move.
      ON the hooded man's eyes, shifting their homicidal intent
      from Helen to Joan.

      Joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to
      pull Helen away from her death grip on the door handle.
      The man begins stalking around the front of the car
      toward her. She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises
      it up as if to hit him. As he steps back to the ax and
      tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at
      him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. He lifts
      an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con-
      tinues to tug at the ax handle.
                                  JOAN
                   Helen!   Help me!

                                  HELEN
                   I can't!   I can't move!!

      Raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced
      to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with
      Joan continuing to batter at him. Then in a sudden burst
      of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her
      grasp and lunges at her.

       Socorro steps into the room. The door automatically
       closes behind her. Duke, in a frenzy, leaps at her, then
       runs toward the glass doors. He hurls himself at the
       glass, then returns to Socorro. Thinking he's gone
       rabid, she screams and tries to hide behind one of the
       weight racks. The above course of procedure continues,
       with Duke trying desperately to indicate his intentions,
       chasing Socorro around and over the press benches and
       exercise paraphernalia.

       (Helen SCREAMING OVER:) The hooded man has Joan up
       against the garage wall. One of his hands is on her
       throat and the other is held over her mouth. In the
       struggle, she manages to sink her teeth into his hand.
       He pulls it free and hits her across the face. She
       reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole-axes
       him on the top of the head. It staggers him briefly and
       enables her to move out of his grasp. She immediately
       grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns
       fiercely toward him.
       Now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently
       having had enough, he begins to back away from her. When
       he reaches a safe distance, he turns and moves quickly
       off, disappearing into the dark.

       Joan, her garments soiled and disheveled from the pre-            *

       closely followed by Duke and Harry:                               *

       As they move into the living room, Helen, wearing Joan's
       chenille robe, her hair wildly askew, can be seen in the
       kitchen area, holding a bottle of liquor in one hand and
       searching through a cupboard for a glass.

                 JOAN                             HARRY
         I can't have him with me         Didn't I tell you, right
         all the time, he's killing       from the start, it's
         my mucous membranes...           very dangerous to fool
                                          around with people like
                                          Red Layls!
                                  JOAN
                    No you didn't, I said he was
                    dangerous, and you said he wasn't...

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah, but that's before he tried
                    to part your hair with an axe!
                                  JOAN
                    I don't know if it was him.   Maybe
                    it was this tree surgeon...
       She starts to move toward the bedroom and he stops her:
                                  HARRY
                    Wait a minute. How tall was he?
                    About six one? Kind of ugly?
       Helen, now with a drink in her hand, steps INTO VIEW
       behind Harry:

                                  HELEN
                    He was about your height.

                                  JOAN
                    No, he wasn't, he was much taller.
                                  HELEN
                    Well let's not quibble, for god
                    sakes. The  man is a complete
                    maniac...
                           (to Harry)
                    And excuse me for saying, but this
                    isn't a job for an amateur...

                    man who burglarized my apartment,

       mood is more subdued.

                It doesn't seem like something

      dressed in one of Andy's negligees.

      Harry stands watching Joan. She pulls the Mercedes half-
      way out of the garage and stops the car to call out to him:

      She waves to him     and pulls the rest of the way out of the

      front of the car,     its handle sharply angled up from the
      hood like a soup     ladle.

      time right now.") She blows him a kiss. Then moves down
      the driveway toward the gates.
      He stands watching until her car disappears. Then he
      moves to front door of the house and finds it locked.

      Moving around to    the side of the house, he unbuckles his
      wrist watch and    puts it in his pants pocket. Then he
      steps up to the    service porch door, sees Socorro inside
      putting clothes    into a washer and raps on the glass
      panel.

      She smiles in recognition and opens the door for him:

      to the desk and as Joan had done previously, goes through           *
      the drawers. Duke sits in the doorway, watching him.                *

      Duke follows Harry's every movement, as he engages in a
      deft, professional search of the bedroom. He goes
      through the bureau drawers, the closet shelves, a pair of
      suitcases, then crosses to one of the two nightstands.
      Finding nothing in the drawer, he moves around to its
      mate on the other side of the bed.

      CLOSE ON HARRY
      He opens the drawer, glances inside and starts to close
      it when he sees:


      POV OF DRAWER
      A gift envelope with his name on it rests on a small
      wrapped box.
      He picks it up, opens the envelope and takes out a plain
      white card with a handwritten message on it:


      CLOSE ON CARD
      "Thank you for everything you've done for me, Harry, and
      mostly, for being in my life. I love you, Joan."

      BACK TO SCENE

      Harry sits down on the bed, feeling the utter deficiency
      of heart implicit in this act of treachery and deception.
      He stares blankly into space for a moment. Then he puts
      the card back, picks up the box and without removing it
      from the drawer, gives it a little shake.

      Adele stands playing a garden hose over the lawn. Two
      pop-eyed little DOGS YAP and mill about her legs. In the
      b.g., Harry's van can be seen in the driveway, and
      presently he appears from the side of the house, carrying
      a suitcase and a few items of clothes. As he moves to
      the van and opens the door, her attention is drawn to
      him:

                   I just got a phone call, honey,
                   from a prominent entertainer up in
                   Vegas, a very well-known singer...

                                 ADELE
                   Who is it, Paul Anka?

                                 HARRY
                   He's a rock star, you probably
                   wouldn't know the name. Anyway, I
                   gotta run a couple a dogs up to
                   him...

                                 ADELE
                   You know, it's T-minus zero and
                   counting, Harry, on this whole
                   shitty deal.
                                 HARRY
                   Now Iwo, don't blow this way out
                   of proportion. You  think I want
                   to do this. I need  the extra cash
                   right now, believe me.
                                 ADELE
                   If you leave, I'm getting Top Lock
                   to come over and change the front
                   and back doors!


                HARRY                              ADELE
        Look, I'm only talking                (screaming at
        about a short period of                the dogs)
        time here.                         Ming! Tippy! Shut
                                           up!!
                                 ADELE
                   I mean it! You get in that van,
                   and I'm taking my building back
                   and putting in a Fingernail Salon!

                                 HARRY
                   Come on now, honey, don't say
                   things like that...
      He puts an arm around her, giving her a perfunctory hug:

                   it...
                          (kisses her on the
                           cheek)
                   Okay?

      Without waiting for a response, he moves back across the
      lawn toward the van and is stopped mid stride as a strong
      spray from the hose hits him squarely on the back.


73    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                        73
      They are finishing dessert and coffee by candlelight.
      Joan's hands encircle Harry's wrist with a new watch.


      ON HARRY AND JOAN
      Seated at the dining table. He is deeply morose and
      makes a half-hearted attempt to enthuse as she tries to
      secure the clasp. (The empty box and the card rest on
      the table next to the watch he used to deceive his way
      into the house.)
                                 HARRY
                   It's really very nice looking,
                   honey.
                                 JOAN
                   Do you like it?
                                   HARRY
                   Yeah.   I do.   Very much.
      She finishes securing the watch.

                                   HARRY (CONT'D)
                   Thank you.

                                 JOAN
                   You're welcome.
                                 HARRY
                   Yeah it's great and it's something
                   I really needed, so...
      He leans over and kisses her on the cheek, then picks up
      his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food.

      Joan's eyes remain on him, trying to divine his mood:
                                 JOAN
                   Is anything wrong?

                               HARRY
                  No. Nothing's wrong.   Everything's
                  fine.
     She resumes eating. Then, desirous of     drawing his atten-
     tion, she fixes her gaze on the table    top and smiles
     pensively, making the assumption that    he is looking at
     her. When no response is forthcoming,     she attempts a
     verbal solicitation:
                                JOAN
                         (without looking up)
                  You're probably wondering why I'm
                  smiling.

     He looks over at her:

                                HARRY
                  What?
                                JOAN
                  I was just thinking that I find
                  this moody side of you very
                  attractive.
                                HARRY
                  Oh, uh-huh.
                                JOAN
                  In fact, if you want to know, and
                  I can see you're dying to...
                         (reaches over and
                          caresses his back)
                  I completely adore you.
                                HARRY
                  Well, same here, honey.

                                JOAN
                  Why are you all wet?

     He lays his fork down and tries to make an awkward and
     difficult excursion into the truth:
                                HARRY
                  You know, there is something I
                  feel I gotta say here, Joan,
                  that's been preying on my mind.
                  Something I maybe should've
                  handled a bit differently with
                  you from the start, about this
                  particular situation I'm in...
                                JOAN
                  What situation?

     Socorro steps INTO VIEW, addressing Joan with great
     excitement:

               SOCORRO                            HARRY

     She motions Joan to follow and disappears into the
     kitchen.

     Joan and Harry, looking toward the television set.
     Socorro stands next to the screen, pointing at herself,
     a small figure near the front door of Andy's house. In
     the f.g. a television REPORTER addresses the camera:
                                SOCORRO
                  Mira, alli estoy.
                                REPORTER (V.O.)
                         (over the above)
                  ... Regarding an earlier press                        *
                  release announcing Mrs. Ellerman's                    *
                  intention to publish her book,                        *
                  which purportedly contains                            *
                  several explosive details concerning                  *
                  Redmon Layls' controversial business
                  dealings.

     Harry coughs loudly as Moncrief appears, standing outside
     a government office building, encircled by a picket of
     microphones attached to a number of floating hands.

                                REPORTER (V.O.)
                  Mr. Layls' lawyer, Laurence                           *
                  Moncrief, had this to say when
                  asked if he was concerned about
                  what might be revealed in the
                  Ellerman book:

                  Mrs. Ellerman's so-called book, or
                  her alleged disappearance, which
                  appears to have all the ear marks
                  of a publicity stunt.

                                JOAN
                         (to Harry, outraged)
                  Can you believe this?!

     She turns contemptuously back to   the screen. The
     Reporter now stands in the f.g.   of a three-story build-
     ing. SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, but    discernible over its
     entrance, are the words: Monroe    Park Center.

                                REPORTER (V.O.)
                  Recent reports of Layls' failing
                  health were denied by his personal
                  physician, Dr. Park. When
                  questioned in a phone interview,
                  he responded that the elusive
                  billionaire...

     As the Reporter continues, Joan moves closer to the TV.

     comes on.                                                         *

              Where's San Dimas?

     Without waiting for his answer, she strides across the
     room:
                            JOAN
              Let's call the T.V. station and
              find out.

              This is not the way you want to go
              about this, honey.
     As she moves OUT OF VIEW into the living room, he turns           *

75   INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    75
     Joan comes out of the bedroom with her purse and jacket
     and with Harry following, crosses the living room:

     They disappear out the front door.


76   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY & GARAGE - NIGHT                   76
     Joan comes out the front door, Harry moving along beside
     her, as she moves crossing briskly toward the garage:
                                HARRY
                  Dammit, Joan, these people are
                  holding all the cards. They'll
                  probably throw you into that
                  bughouse with your sister.

     She begins moving a little less purposively than before:
                                HARRY
                  You want to go there and call 'em
                  a bunch of names, throw a lot of
                  accusations at them? They don't
                  care. People with that kind of
                  money behind them, with their kind
                  of connections, they never go to
                  jail, you never see them behind
                  bars.

     They stop in front of the garage where Joan's car is
     parked:
                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  Am I getting through to you?

     She nods.

                   Alright.

      Though evidently very troubled, she nevertheless goes
      into the garage, opens the driver's door and gets into
      the car.

                                 HARRY

      The Mercedes moves along one of the surface streets with
      the ax handle still protruding from its hood.

      Joan, staring grimly out the windshield as she snails
      along in the right-hand lane. Harry begins shifting
      fitfully around, grumbling:
                                 HARRY
                   This is just nuts, what you're
                   doing.
                                 JOAN
                   Will you stop trying to undermine
                   me every inch of the way.

                   Anyway, I didn't ask you to drag
                   along with me.
                                 HARRY
                   You're the one that's dragging
                   along.
                          (gesturing at a semi

                  Don't tell me what to do.

                                HARRY
                  Okay, just let me drive the
                  goddamned car, that's all I ask.

                                JOAN
                  Why should I let you drive?
                                HARRY
                  Why? I'll tell you why, because
                  you're a terrible driver, that's
                  why.

                                JOAN
                  Oh, now all the ugly little truths
                  are coming out.
                                HARRY
                  You operate this vehicle like it
                  was a cane with a red tip painted
                  on the end of it.

                                JOAN
                  Don't talk to me, Harry. I mean
                  it, just don't say another word to
                  me!

     He angrily folds his arms across his chest, assuming a
     sullen silence for a moment. The traffic has come to a
     grid-lock stop, raising their anxiety levels:
                                JOAN (CONT'D)
                  I was doing just fine until you
                  started in on me...

                  And now look at me.   I've got
                  purpose tremors...

     He suddenly opens the door, gets out and moves to the ax
     handle. Joan watches as he makes several unsuccessful
     attempts to pull the ax out of the hood of the car.

     He gives up and moves back to the passenger door, passing
     a man in an adjacent car, looking curiously from the ax
     handle to him:
                             HARRY
               Is something the fuck bothering
               you, pal?

     He gets into the Mercedes and slams the door.

     Joan moves quickly through the parking lot and onto a
     walkway leading to the hospital entrance. Harry,
     trailing behind, calls up to her:
                             HARRY
               Can I at least offer some advice?
                               JOAN
               No.
                              HARRY
               Good. Just barge into  the place,
               honey, and play the big hero.
                      (pauses for a
                        response)
               When he tells you your sister's
               not there, what're you going to
               do, cry?
     She stops walking and as he moves up beside her, looks
     defiantly at him:

                               JOAN
               Okay.   What?


     REMOTE ANGLE ON HARRY AND JOAN
     He takes her by the hand and leads the way over the
     grounds toward the rear quarters of the hospital.

      They step inside a narrow hallway leading to one of the
      main corridors of the hospital. As they edge past a
      laundry cart outside a utility room, Harry releases her
      hand. She moves ahead, then experiencing a sudden loss
      of nerve, stops and looks back to see Harry rummaging
      through the dirty laundry.


84    INT. M.P. CENTER/HALLWAY - NIGHT                             84
      Harry, in a white doctor's jacket, with Joan at his side,
      move through a corridor. As she glances nervously about,
      then at him:
                                JOAN
                  This isn't going to work.   You
                  look like a busboy.
      They approach a nurses' station and Harry steps forward
      to address one of TWO NURSES behind the counter:
                                HARRY
                  Excuse me, Nurse...

      and Harry move in the direction indicated.

                  I hope you know what you're doing.

                  Don't worry.   Just do what I told
                  you.
      They approach room 206. (In the hallway outside the
      adjacent room, an old man in a hospital gown is seated in
      a wheelchair. He wears a stingy-brim hat on his head and
      reads a pamphlet entitled "Colostomy and You.")

      and is about to follow, when:

      Approaching up the hallway.

      He takes a few steps towards her, assuming his all-purpose
      scowl:

                   What's the problem, dear?

                   Park, just to be sure he's
                   authorized you to examine Mrs.

                   have to follow certain...
                                   HARRY
                   I understand.    You're doing your
                   job.
                                 NURSE ONE

                           around him)
                   Where did your assistant...?
                              HARRY
                She had to step inside for a
                moment, to relieve herself.

85   INT. M.P. CENTER/ANDY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT                    85
     Joan is now wearing Andy's hospital gown, while Andy is
     hastily buttoning herself into Joan's blouse:

                            ANDY
              And if this little kinglet of
              corporate shit thinks he can get
              away with this, he's greatly
              mistaken. Just wait 'til he hears
              what I'm going to come out with
              now.

     Joan thrusts her skirt at Andy:
                             JOAN
              Put this on.

                            ANDY
              Remember when he passed me off as
              staff and I was put on official
              government payroll all through
              Maui and the Yucatan Mission?
                             JOAN
              No, I don't.   And hurry up, will
              you.
     And as Andy steps into the skirt, Joan takes over the
     uncompleted buttoning chores:

                            ANDY
              Yes you do, remember, when I
              almost died of the vomito negro?
              Well that's when he was doing all
              that illegal oil drilling off the
              Mexican Gulf...
     She turns to look critically at her face in the mirror:

                            ANDY
              Have you got any lipstick?

              I assume you're a fairly recent
              associate of the doctor's?

                            HARRY
              That's very correct.

                                HARRY
                  I'd say female troubles, mainly.

                                NURSE ONE
                  Oh, so Dr. Park feels there's a
                  gynecological involvement here.

                                HARRY
                  Sometimes he does, yes.
                         (a beat)
                  By the way, did anyone ever tell
                  you what attractive eyebrows you
                  have?

                  Oh, well, no, they haven't...
     Her attention is diverted to a SECOND NURSE entering the
     wing, calling out to her and making a summoning gesture:

                  Excuse me a minute, Doctor.
     Harry watches as she moves away, and while the two Nurses
     engage in an exchange some distance down the hall, he
     steps back to the door, opens it and sticks his head
     inside:

                  Administrative Lounge until we can
                  get a hold of him. Would that be
                  alright?
                               HARRY
                  Certainly.
     He moves to the door, opens it, blocking the Nurse's view
     into it with his body.


     HIS POV OF JOAN
     Looking frightened at her imminent abandonment.

                                HARRY (O.S.)
                  Don't worry Mrs. Ellerman, we'll
                  be right back.
     Andy, wearing dark glasses and with her hair hidden up
     under the stingy-brim hat, steps out into the hallway.


     BACK TO SCENE
     Harry takes her by the arm and looks amiably toward the
     Nurse.

                               HARRY
                  Which way?

                                NURSE ONE                           *
                         (gesturing a direction)
                  That way, Doctor, and thank you
                  very much for your patience.

                             HARRY
               Don't mention it.
     The Nurse watches briefly as they move away, then
     extracting a key from her pocket, she steps over to the
     door and locks it.

                                                            91.

87   EXT. M.P. CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT                         87
     Harry, outside the Mercedes, glancing around furtively,
     while inside the car, Andy continues to perseverate about
     Red Layls as she struggles out of Joan's clothes:
                            ANDY
              And this man, who wouldn't know
              the truth if it came up and spit
              him in the eye, is accusing me of
              lying...
     She hands him the skirt out through the window:

                            ANDY
              You know what that prick had his
              lawyer say to me?

     Harry lays the skirt on the hood of the car and begins
     getting out of the doctor's jacket.
                              ANDY
              That I   was a pretty, grudge-
              bearing   little malcontent, grasping
              at some   splinter of celebrity for
              myself   at his expense. Can you
              believe   that?
     She hands him out the blouse and he turns politely away
     from her semi-nudity as he hands her the doctor's jacket.

                            HARRY
              Here, put this on.
                            ANDY
              I mean, the arrogance...
                     (getting into the
                      jacket)
              What did she say your name was?

                             HARRY
              Harry.

                            ANDY
                     (flirtatiously)
              Have you got a cigarette, Harry?

     He takes a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from his
     shirt pocket and hands them to her:
                            HARRY
              Stay in the car. Don't talk to
              anybody, and I'll be right back.

     He immediately moves off, rolling Joan's clothes into a
     bundle and heading back to the hospital grounds.

     Harry, hurrying across the grounds to the rear of  the
     hospital. (In the distant b.g. beyond him, the
     Continental can be seen pulling up and parking on  a
     street bordering the hospital. Moncrief, carrying   a
     briefcase, and his chauffeur (Sturge), get out and   move
     onto a walkway leading to the hospital entrance)


89   EXT. M.P. CENTER - REAR - NIGHT                              89
     Harry rounds the corner of the hospital building and
     stops:
     Two male hospital employees are smoking and conversing
     outside the door he had previously entered with Joan.

                               HARRY
               Fuck!
     He turns and moves OUT OF SIGHT.

90   INT. M.P. CENTER/ANDY'S ROOM - NIGHT                         90

     Joan, in a state of extreme nervousness, paces about the
     room. Her perambulations bring her near the door to the
     hallway. She reaches to the doorknob, tests it and finds
     she is locked in.

                               JOAN
               Christ.
     A soft WHISTLE comes from the vicinity of the windows
     behind her, followed by Harry's voice, whispering:
                              HARRY (O.S.)
               Joan?   Are you there?

     She crosses quickly to the windows, looking out through the
     thick wire mesh at Harry:


     HER POV
     He stands several feet below, looking up at the window.

                               HARRY
               Is that you?

     BACK TO SCENE

                               JOAN

                                HARRY
                  I'm having a little trouble getting
                  back in.
                                JOAN
                  Oh great, Harry. What have you
                  got me into?

                                JOAN
                  Don't worry, honey...

                                JOAN
                  You have to get me out of here!
                                HARRY
                  Everything's under control, just
                  hang on a few more minutes and
                  I'll be right back, okay?
     As he moves out of sight, her attention is drawn to the
     sound of MUFFLED VOICES in the hallway. In a panic, she
     starts toward the bathroom, changes her mind, moves to
     the bed and gets into it. As the door begins to open,
     she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head
     with it.

     ON MONCRIEF AND STURGE

     Being let into the room by a male nurse. He closes the
     door after them and the two men look toward the bed:
                                 MONCRIEF
                  Andy?   It's Larry Moncrief.

                  minute? I'd like to talk to you.

91   EXT. MONROE PARK CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT                    91

     ON Andy in the driver's seat of the Mercedes. The window
     is rolled up and she puffs impatiently on a cigarette.
     Presently, she catches sight of something out the
     driver's window and turns to look:

     A sleek black car with opaque'd windows pulls into a
     parking slot several yards away. A faded male beauty,
     somewhere in his 50s, gets out of the rear passenger door
     and as he moves to the walkway leading to the hospital
     grounds:

     She quickly rolls down the window and angrily addresses
     him:
                                ANDY
                  You son of a bitch!

     RED LAYLS looks toward the Mercedes and as he approaches,
     we can see a medical beeper attached to his belt.


     HIS POV OF ANDY
     Her hair still hidden under the stingy-brim, her eyes
     unrecognizable behind the dark glasses.

     BACK TO SCENE

     He comes up to the car, peering closely at its occupant:
                                RED
                  Who is it?

                                ANDY
                  Who the hell do you think it is?!
                                 RED
                  Sweetheart?   Is that you?
     She pulls the dark glasses off...

                                ANDY
                  No thanks to you, it's me.
     ... and throws them onto the dashboard.

92   EXT. M.P. CENTER/GROUNDS - NIGHT                            92

     Harry hastens back along the walkway to the parking lot.
     Once again he halts abruptly in his tracks:
                                HARRY
                  Aw, Jesus.

     HIS POV - RED LAYLS

     Opening the driver's door and reaching in to take hold of
     Andy's arm. (As she steps out of the car, we see that
     below the doctor's jacket Harry had intended to retrieve,
     she is bare-legged and wears Joan's high heels.)


     BACK TO SCENE
     Harry turns and strides back toward the hospital.

93   INT. M.P. PARK CENTER/ANDY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT             93

     Moncrief places a briefcase on a nightstand next to the
     bed. As he opens it and searches through its contents:
                                MONCRIEF
                  Before he arrives, I'd like you to take a
                  look at a list of certain deletions and
                  expurgations, which if agreed to...
     He removes several typed pages, stapled together and
     looks down at the pillow covering Joan's face:
                                MONCRIEF
                  ... Red is, very generously, I
                  think, prepared to offer his
                  sanction to a sanitized version of
                  your book.
     No response. Moncrief glances over at Sturge, standing
     near the door, then back at the figure on the bed.
                                MONCRIEF
                  I think you should know, that if
                  you push this too far, you run the
                  risk of having him withdraw his
                  consent to your well-being.
                         (pauses, then)
                  I don't think we want that, do we,
                  Andy?
     He reaches down and removes the pillow.    Joan looks fear-
     fully up at him:

                             JOAN
               Andy's not here.

                             MONCRIEF
               I can see that, Miss Spruance.
               Would you care to tell me where
               she is?

     She sits up, glancing uneasily at Sturge, then attempts
     to assert herself boldly to Moncrief:

                                JOAN
                  As a matter of fact, she happens
                  to be on her way to the police
                  right now, accompanied by a close
                  friend of mine...
     Her bluff is immediately belied by:

                                  HARRY (O.S.)
                  Honey?    It's me again.
     Moncrief and Joan look toward the window:

                                HARRY (O.S.)
                  I have to tell you something.
     Joan jumps from the bed and moves to address Harry:
                                JOAN
                  Don't say a word, Harry!       I'm not
                  alone!
     Moncrief looks at the chauffeur, gesturing toward the
     door.
                                 MONCRIEF
                  Sturge.

     wheeled along the main walkway by a hospital orderly.

                  See? I never cashed the fucking
                  thing!

     He tears the envelope in half and as he throws it on the
     ground, a hand the size of a large dictionary reaches
     INTO FRAME and grabs him roughly by the back of his shirt
     collar.

97   INT. M.P. PARK CENTER/ANDY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - JOAN'S            97
     POV - HARRY AND STURGE - NIGHT
     lurching about in a grappler's waltz below the window.
     In the b.g. the old man can be seen leaning down to the
     walkway, picking up the stingy-brim hat and returning it
     to his head.
     She turns from the window to see a subdued Andy entering,
     her eyes showing signs of recent weeping. Behind her in
     the hall, Moncrief can be seen greeting Red Layls.

     Joan moves over to her...
                                JOAN
                  Are you alright?
     ... And in response to Andy's stoical nod:

                                JOAN
                  No you're not.
                         (embracing her)
                  What did that bastard do to you?

                                ANDY
                  I need a Kleenex.
     She moves toward the nightstand with Joan following:

                                JOAN
                  You know what they're trying to do,
                  don't you? To force you into
                  signing some kind of agreement
                  that...

                                ANDY
                  Wait, I want to tell you what he
                  said to me...
     She extracts a tissue from a dispenser on the nightstand:

                                ANDY (CONT'D)
                  He said I was the only woman he's
                  ever really cared for...

                               JOAN
                  What?!
                                ANDY
                  And when he said it...
                         (blowing her nose)
                  ... he had a tear in his eye...

     Joan's jaw goes slack in disbelief.

     ON RED

     Glancing sourly at the two women, as he and Moncrief
     enter.
                                MONCRIEF
                  Well this moves to the top of the
                  list, Red, as one of your more
                  stunning achievements.

                                RED
                         (irritably)
                  Get me something cold to drink,
                  will you?

                               MONCRIEF
                  Certainly.

     ON SISTERS

     Speaking in hushed, and in Joan's case, urgent tones,
     while, in the b.g., Moncrief exits to the hallway.

                                JOAN
                  Andy, you don't know what you're
                  saying. You're suffering from
                  hostage syndrome or something.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

97   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             97
                                ANDY
                  Well, after all I do love him.

                                JOAN
                  You 'love' him?!

                                ANDY
                  Yes, he's been a very important
                  man in my life, you know that.
                                JOAN
                         (raising her voice)
                  Oh, now he's not a fecal-faced,
                  great white shark!

     Andy looks over at RED, now seated in one of the two
     chairs in the room. Moncrief can be seen re-entering
     and joining him.
                                ANDY
                  I don't know where she got that.
                         (back to Joan)
                  Will you please keep your voice
                  down. He's very sensitive to what
                  people say.
                                JOAN
                  'Sensitive'? Have you lost all
                  your beads?! This man had you
                  kidnapped and kept in a drugged
                  stupor for the last three weeks,
                  and now he's...


     ON HARRY
     Stepping into the doorway, holding Struge in a painful
     armlock:
                                HARRY
                  Alright, what the hell's going on
                  in here?
                                RED
                  Who's this?

                                MONCRIEF
                  That's the dog trainer.
                                RED
                  I thought he was working for us.

                                MONCRIEF
                  Well there seems to be a little
                  grey area there, Red.
                                RED
                         (to Harry)
                  Come over here, I want to talk to
                  you.
     Harry releases Sturge and moves over to Layls, offering
     his hand and trying to maintain his gruff manner:

                                 HARRY
                  Mr. Layls...

     Joan looks with dismay at Harry's apostasy as he shakes
     "the great man's" hand, then quickly returns her atten-
     tion to Andy:
                                JOAN
                  Will you listen to me! This man
                  is not only a bastard, he's a
                  scummy, soul-less little thug and
                  a criminal!
                                ANDY
                  Are you implying that I have
                  defective judgement in men, Joanie?

     Red and Harry, as before. In the b.g., a hospital
     employee wheels a cart holding several glasses of iced
     tea. Moncrief moves over to the cart and the employee
     exits.

                                 HARRY
                  I just  want a say, that though
                  you're  someone in a category I
                  admire,  you've gone to some
                  lengths  on this thing here, that
                  I don't  entirely agree with...

                                RED
                  Sit down. I have a neck condition
                  and it aggravates me to have to
                  look up at you.

                                 HARRY
                  Okay.   No problem.
     As he seats himself in the other chair, Red reaches up
     and takes a glass of tea offered by Moncrief:

                                HARRY (CONT'D)
                  But I want to go on and finish my
                  thought on this, because...

                  You know, I'm not in the best of
                  health right now, and I've been
                  advised to avoid excitement...
     Harry takes a second glass from Moncrief:

                                RED (CONT'D)
                  So if you intend to do that...
                         (after a sip of tea)
                  I might just have to have my shock
                  troops blow your brains out.
                                HARRY
                  Oh, uh huh.

                                RED
                         (holds the glass up
                          to Moncrief)
                  More sugar.

                                JOAN
                  And furthermore, this 'sensitive'
                  man's lawyer more than implied
                  they were willing to put your feet,
                  as well as probably mine, into a

                           Moncrief)
                  Would somebody please get me my
                  clothes!

     (In the b.g., Sturge exits on another flunky errand.)
                                RED
                  Just put yourself, Harry, for a
                  moment, in the shoes of a man
                  whose sole intention is to leave
                  the world a better place than he
                  found it, only to discover those
                  intentions have been painfully
                  slandered by someone he'd given
                  both his heart and his economic
                  support to, not to mention his
                  trust...

     looking over at Harry, protesting loudly:

                                JOAN
                  Harry, I can't believe you're
                  sitting there nodding your head
                  and having a tea party with these
                  crooks!

                  I'm not nodding my head, honey,
                  I'm just listening to the man.

                  Who is this guy, anyway? Isn't he
                  a little sleazy, Joanie, a bit
                  infra dig? I mean Lewie's a bit
                  of a stiff, but...

                                JOAN
                  You're going to talk to me about
                  sleaze, when you consorted with
                  some maniac tree surgeon, who was
                  flicking his tongue out at me like
                  some rutting iguana, and groping
                  at his naturalia at three in the
                  morning?!

                                ANDY
                  Oh, 'him.'

     She looks to the chauffeur, re-entering with her clothes.
                                 JOAN
                  Oh 'him'?!   He came at me with an
                  ax!

                                ANDY
                  Well, he's very immature.

     Before Joan can respond, she crosses to take her
     belongings from Sturge, and as she moves toward the
     bathroom:

     of the beleaguered maiden she hoped to rescue, pausing on
     her way, to lean down and kiss the cheek of the dragon
     she meant to slay.


     ON JOAN
     As Moncrief steps up to her, offering a glass of tea:

                  No, thank you.

                  Excuse me!

                  I don't know what    kind of spell
                  you've cast on my    sister, but it
                  doesn't extend to    me...

       He's got a bad neck...            I'm not afraid of these
                                         snakes!!

     She looks defiantly from Harry to Moncrief, then back to
     Red, who regards her coldly for a moment, then:
                                RED
                  I never much cared for you, young
                  lady. And I find your display of
                  anger both unattractive and
                  unfeminine.
                                HARRY
                         (to Red)
                  Now wait a minute...

                                JOAN
                         (overlapping)
                  I'm not here to beg your good
                  opinion...

     Under the following, Red's BEEPER begins SIGNALING:

               HARRY                             JOAN (CONT'D)
       ... Red Layls or not, you         ... or to find out
       don't insult this party in        the right amount of
       my presence.                      attractiveness and
                                         likability I'm supposed
                                         to render up!
     Without removing his eyes from Joan's, he raises the
     beeper to his mouth and presses the speaker button:

                                RED
                  What is it?

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                  Doctor Park is trying to reach
                  you.
                                RED
                  Tell him to hold on.
                         (then, to Joan)
                  First, you assume far more interest
                  in you on my part than exists. I
                  had nothing whatsoever to do with
                  your supposed misfortunes...

                  And as regards Andy's house, I'd
                  have no need to break into Andy's
                  house, because I own Andy's house.
                                JOAN
                  I don't care whose house you own,
                  you're nothing but a slimy, mean-                      *

     ON ANDY

     Partially dressed, stepping into the doorway and combing
     her hair as she addresses Joan:
                                ANDY
                  Will you please stop interfering
                  in my personal life, Joanie.

     Red lifts the beeper to his mouth again:

               RED                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
       Go ahead.                           I just want to go out
                                           to the yacht and get a
               PARK (V.O.)                 little color back, for
       Red? I've got good news.            god sakes...
       We've found one for you.

                                JOAN
                  Andy, you know something?

     As she moves over to Andy, Red gets up, paces around with
     the beeper and his and Parks' VOICES are MUFFLED in b.g.
                                JOAN (CONT'D)
                  The kind of woman you are is a
                  danger to the kind of woman I am,
                  so the next time you and your
                  boyfriend have a domestic spat,
                  don't call me!

                                ANDY
                  Well if you're going to take this
                  kind of grumpy attitude, I
                  certainly won't.

     And as she goes back into the bathroom, Joan turns to
     Harry:

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Harry, where are my clothes?

                                 HARRY
                  Uh...

     He stands up and Red steps INTO FRAME beside him, a
     distressed look on his face as he listens to Park (V.O.):

                HARRY                            PARK (V.O.)
       I think they must be              I'm over at Poly-
       outside.                          Medical. How soon can
                                         you get over here?
               JOAN
       Will you go get them                      RED (V.O.)
       please, I'd like to leave.        Wait a minute, don't
                                         rush me on this,
                                         Monroe.
     Harry moves around Red and steps up to Joan:


               HARRY                             PARK (V.O.)
       Can I just talk to you for        I'm not rushing you,
       one minute first?                 but we don't have the
                                         luxury of waiting too
               JOAN                      long either.
       There's nothing for you to
       say, Harry, it's very clear               RED (V.O.)
       what your priorities are.         Well, I want a hell of
                                         a lot more information
               HARRY                     before you start
       Honey, all I've been trying       carving me up.
       to do, from day one, is
       look out for you...                       PARK (V.O.)
            (pauses)                     I can tell you this
       Don't you believe that?           much, Red, I've taken a
                                         look at it and I'm very
                                         excited.

                                 JOAN
                  No, I don't.
                                RED
                  Will you people be quiet, I can't
                  hear this.
                       (to the beeper)
                  Go ahead.

     Joan and Harry are forced to listen to the following
     exchange:
                                PARK (V.O.)
                  It's as sound a muscular bag as
                  I've ever seen and the pericordium
                  is a gorgeous color.

                  I don't have any specific data,
                  but the host was around 35 and she
                  was obviously very healthy.

                  Godammit, Monroe!

     He begins pacing anxiously again, the CAMERA FOLLOWING
     him:

                                RED (CONT'D)
                  I told you I don't want a woman's
                  heart!
                                PARK (V.O.)
                  Don't worry, it's not going to
                  change you in any way.
                                RED
                  How do you know?!   You don't know

                  Look, let's just get it done.
     As Red paces toward the open bathroom door, Harry and Joan
     resume their discord:


               HARRY                             PARK (V.O.)
       In other words, you don't         And later if you find

                  Would you please get me my clothes.
     Moncrief steps in beside Joan:

     Andy pauses in her application of mascara, shifting her

     behind her:

               You can't tell me what kind of a

     Harry suddenly grabs Moncrief roughly by the arm:
                             HARRY
               Never mind that shit.   Tell her...
     He shakes him, causing him to spill his iced tea onto the
     front of his jacket:

                             HARRY (CONT'D)
               Did I spend your money! Did I
               give you any services for it.
               Tell this woman the truth, you
               son of a bitch!
     Harry releases him and under the following, Moncrief
     takes out a handkerchief and dabs at his jacket:

               Well, shall we start with the fact

                   Wait a minute, honey...
      As she disappears inside, Red re-enters, and covering the

                   Westside Slasher! And this is the
                   doctor you recommended to me!

                   You're killing me, Monroe! You

      Joan moves quickly down the hall, putting the doctor's
      jacket on over her hospital smock, with Harry following,
      trying desperately to explain:

                Honey,   there's a simple explanation
                to all   of this, if you want me to
                go into   it... I was trying to tell
                you at   dinner...
      She disappears into an intersecting hallway.

                Will you just stop for one minute
                and let me talk to you... It's

      He disappears into the same hallway.

                   weighing on you at the time, and
                   because you don't think the right
                   person is ever going to come along.
                                 JOAN
                   I would never have knowingly become
                   involved with a married man.
                                 HARRY
                   I know that, that's why I was
                   trying to come out and tell you...

                                  JOAN
                   Please, I don't want to discuss it
                   anymore.
                          (after a brief
                            silence)
                   I bet you never read Dante, either.

                                 HARRY
                   Now there you're 75 percent wrong.
                                 JOAN
                   I mean, I can't believe it, that
                   you'd lie to me about this...
                                 HARRY
                   Okay, I lied. Didn't you ever
                   tell a lie? If not let me kiss
                   your high heel.
                                 JOAN
                   I'm going in the house.

                   Wait. Can I call you tomorrow,
                   just to see how you're feeling?
                   Or how things are going?
                                 JOAN
                   I have a dress rehearsal tomorrow
                   and a concert on Friday. That's
                   all I care about right now.
      She reaches to the door handle, then very emotionally:

                                 JOAN (CONT'D)
                   And I don't want to see you

                                 HARRY
                   Don't say that, please. I'm
                   asking you to just give me the
                   chance to clear up all these
                   things in my life, because...
                                 JOAN
                   No. I didn't extricate myself
                   from the infidelities of one man,
                   just to fall into the arms of the
                   prince of prevaricators...
                                 HARRY
                   Well, I may be all kinds of a son
                   of a bitch, and the prince of
                   whatever, but that doesn't mean I
                   wouldn't, when it comes down to
                   it, stand up and take the bullet
                   for you.
      She finally looks over at him, her eyes brimming with
      tears:
                                 JOAN
                   That's not what I observed, Harry.

      She opens the door and gets out.

      steps to the front door and disappears inside.

       BACK TO SCENE

       He remains seated for a moment, glancing briefly down at
       the watch on his wrist. Then his eyes raise expectantly
       as:


       POV - DUKE
       comes out the door and lopes across the driveway toward
       the Mercedes.

101    EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                         101

       Harry lays a hand on Duke's head, half-heartedly acknow-
       ledging the dog's devoted greeting, then he moves with
       him toward the van. On his way, he glances somberly
       over his shoulder at the house. In so doing his gaze
       falls on the ax embedded in the hood of the Mercedes. He
       stops and walks back to the car.
       Once again, he takes hold of the ax handle and makes
       several attempts to dislodge it. In a final Arthurian
       effort, the blade yields and he pulls the ax free. He
       suddenly steps back away from the car, as a steamy spray
       of hot radiator water spurts up from the gash in the top
       of the hood. Then he glances guiltily toward the house,
       and moves to his van with Duke following.


101A   EXT. HOUSE OF BLISS/INSIDE HARRY'S VAN - DAY               101A
       Harry, his suitcase and clothes in the front seat and
       Duke in bed of the van, parks in front of the House of

101B   EXT. HOUSE OF BLISS/REAR APARTMENT - DAY                   101B

       Harry knocks on the door of the apartment, waits for a
       response and getting none, steps over to one of the
       windows and looks inside:
                                  LEE (O.S.)
                    Harry, I want my dog.

       He turns around to see his ex-partner, Lee MacGreevy
       standing on the pathway.

                                  HARRY
                    Hey, Lee, how are you.
                           (moves toward him)
                    I just this minute got back from
                    Vegas. I was dealing a couple of
                    dogs to Paul Anka.
                           (shakes his hand)
                    I was about to give you a call.
                                  LEE
                    Don't embarrass us both, man.
                    Just give me the dog back, and
                    let's preserve the friendship.

       ON HARRY AND LEE

       as they move over to Lee's van:
                                  HARRY
                    Lee, I'm in the neighborhood of
                    getting my hands on the money.
                    I'm about to close a business deal
                    with Vark Zulethian of Zulethian
                    Carpets, you've probably heard of
                    him...
                                  LEE
                    Come on, I know these dodges
                    backwards and forwards. I need
                    the dog. He's up for a TV series.
       They stop beside the van. Harry glances at the printing
       on the side panel: Lee MacGreevy - Trainer of "Duke," -
       The World's Smartest Dog.
                                  LEE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           (over the above)
                    I don't even want the ten thousand
                    now, compared to what he might
                    appreciate to.

       ON HARRY

       as Lee opens his van and takes out a leash.

                                  HARRY
                    Look, our agreement was I could
                    buy the dog back. He's  the only
                    thing I got to prove to people
                    what I can do, and all I'm asking
                    you, Lee, is...

                                  LEE
                    Don't make me have to get legal
                    with you, Harry. You sold me the
                    animal, then as a personal favor,
                    I let you borrow him, to demo to
                    some V.I.P.. that probably don't
                    even exist. You haven't been
                    straight with me, man.
                           (hands him the leash)
                    Just go get the dog.


       ON DUKE AND HARRY
       as they come across the parking lot to Lee's van.    Harry
       hands him the leash and Lee addresses Duke:

                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                    Get in.
       He ignores the command and looks at Harry:
                                  HARRY
                    Duke, geh im wagen.
       Duke jumps into the back of the van. Inside is a large
       wire travel kennel with another German shepherd inside.
       Lee removes the leash from Duke and gestures at the other
       dog:
                                  LEE
                    Why don't you take this dog, Harry.
                    He's green, but maybe you could do
                    something with him.
       He opens the cage and clips the leash to the dog's
       collar.

                                  HARRY
                    No, I don't want the dog.

       The shepherd jumps out to the ground, wagging his tail:
                                   LEE
                            (giving him the
                             leash)
                    Go ahead, man. Take him. If you
                    don't want him, pick up some
                    change.
                            (closing the van)
                    Sell him for a pet.

       As Lee starts to walk past him, Harry detains him, indi-
       cating the words on the side panel of the van:

                    Do me one favor, will you? Say
                    'owner' if you want to, but don't
                    say 'trainer.' I trained that dog.
                                  LEE
                           (claps him on the
                            shoulder)
                    Let me think about that, okay?
       He moves past him and OUT OF FRAME.

       Harry, watching Lee's van pull away. In the rear window
       Duke's face can be seen, looking back at him.

                    What do you want, Harry?

       Without responding, he looks across to the House of

                    You want the Meatloaf Special?

       No response.

                                  VITA (CONT'D)
                    Do you want anything?
       He finally answers, but from some place deeply felt and
       unrelated to the day's specials:
                                 HARRY
                    Yeah.

                    I can take her home.
                                  HELEN
                    Good, because I don't want you to
                    be alone. Alright?
                           (blows her a kiss)

                 I'd like to move to a small town,
                 where it's friendly, and everybody
                 knows each other, and there are no
                 bars on the windows...
                                  EDDY

                                    JOAN
                    Thanks, Eddy.

       He laughs, then:
                                  EDDY
                    Well, it's true. It doesn't matter
                    where you live. Shit happens.
                                  JOAN
                    Are you in a bad mood or something?

                                  EDDY
                    No. I'm not in a bad mood.   Not as
                    bad as yours.

       After a moment, he begins softly singing the words to a
       popular song.

       HIS POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

       A sports car is in between the van and Eddy's Jeep. From
       the higher vantage point of the van, he has a clear view
       through the rear window of Eddy's Jeep and just before it
       makes a right-hand turn onto a northbound street, Joan
       can be seen leaning over to Eddy, placing her face close
       to his.

       Stunned and disturbed by the implications of what he's
       seen.

       Joan, singing the same song as above, her head inclined
       toward Eddy's, harmonizing her voice with his as the Jeep
       turns onto a street leading up into the Hollywood Hills.

       Further up the winding road a car passes him, obscuring
       his view of Eddy's Jeep.

       Eddy and Joan are now midway above the city. They drive
       in silence for a while, then he begins what seems to be a
       casual reminiscence.

                                  EDDY
                    Remember when we were on tour in
                    Japan, in '86?

       She looks over at him.

                                 JOAN
                   That was witty of me.
                                 EDDY
                   But you weren't. Because an hour
                   later, you went into Lewie's room
                   and you didn't come out.
                                 JOAN

      She sighs impatiently, then:                                     *

                    Somebody did.

       He returns his hand to the steering wheel. She looks at

       The Jeep pitches about on its shocks as it moves up an
       incline graded slightly higher than the one already
       giving Harry trouble. Eddy shifts into four-wheel.
       Joan, jostled about by the uneven surface beneath them,
       looks over at him:

                               JOAN
                 I didn't deserve it. I've always
                 thought of you and treated you as
                 one of my closest and dearest
                 friends...

                 I use to think very highly of you,
                 too, but now I don't like what I
                 see. In fact, it's been very
                 disturbing to me, Joan.
                        (pauses, then)
                 Very disillusioning. To see that
                 before you've even gotten rid of
                 Lewie, you've started up with some
                 other man.

       looks up toward the taillights of Eddy's Jeep, disap-
       pearing in the hazy distance. He looks for a rock and
       finding one large enough, wedges it under one of the rear

       down to something lying out of sight to the left of the
       driver's seat:

                 You know, there's so  many things
                 about me you have no  idea of. You

                 down to...

       She breaks off as she catches sight of a knife held in
       his left hand.

                 feelings I have, that Lewie or
                 anyone else in your life, are not
                 capable of...
       She suddenly reaches frantically to the door handle and
       tries to get out. He grabs hold of her arm and pulls her
       back into the seat:

                 See? You're not genuinely

                 Don't you think I know that, better
                 than anybody?
       He takes her arm and places it around his neck.

       Eddy and Harry, the latter finding himself engaged in a
       violent scuffle with a man larger than himself and
       possessed of the prodigious strength of the psychotic.

       Joan hurries around   the car. Harry, his cheek cut, is
       trying to force the   knife out of Eddy's hand. She looks
       toward Harry's van,   parked several yards behind Eddy's
       car and immediately   runs over to it.


       ON VAN
       She pulls open the door and addressing the dog inside,
       points toward Harry and Eddy:

                                   JOAN
                    Duke, fasse!

       The shepherd jumps out of the car, runs past her to the
       nearest bush and lifts his leg on it.

                                 JOAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh shit...

       She runs back to the two men and hurls herself at them,
       causing all three of them to land in the brush on an
       incline at the side of road.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                  125.

       A frantic free-for-all takes place on the precarious
       footing of the hillside, with Joan alternately pulling at
       one and pushing at the other. The intensity and violence
       of their struggle is such that she is knocked further
       down the incline. Harry, quickly glances down the hill
       to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow
       by Eddy, who breaks free and runs to his car.

       Harry pursues him, catching him as he tries to get into
       the car. He pushes him against the door and they begin
       battering each other with a series of punches.

       The SHEPHERD, wanting to join in the excitement, leaps
       about them, BARKING joyously. Then finding Eddy's
       sleeve, he takes it in his mouth and begins shaking it
       vigorously.

       Joan, her hair fretted   with twigs, climbs up over the
       edge of the hill. In    the b.g. behind her, a HELICOPTER
       APPROACHES. She looks    toward Harry and Eddy trading
       blows, then climbs up   the rest of the way, and as she
       gets to her feet, she   picks up a stone and throws it at
       them, yelling:

                                  JOAN
                    You bastards!!
       The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is
       bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing
       a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a
       series of invectives, at the lights of the city below,
       her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS.
       The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and
       an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above:
                                  VOICE
                           (from above)
                    What are you people doing down
                    there?

       Joan turns back to Harry. He holds the now unconscious
       Eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations,
       starts to move toward Joan:

                                  HARRY
                    Are you crazy?! What are you
                    doing, running around with a guy
                    like this!!

       She raises her arm, ready to hurl the last stone:

                                    JOAN
                    You maniacs!!    You liars!!   You
                    shits!!

                    What are you yelling at me for?!
                    This son of a bitch is probably
                    the Westside Slasher!

124    INT. HELICOPTER - VIEW OUT WINDOW - NIGHT                     124

       of the circling HELICOPTER: A man, holding onto a life-
       less body, seems to be stalking toward a woman in a
       defensive stance, standing on the edge of the hill with
       a stone in her hand.
                                  MAN
                    It looks like a domestic quarrel.
                    Let's get a car up here quick.


       BACK TO HARRY AND JOAN
       She is yelling at him:
                                  JOAN
                    I'm finished wagging my tail and
                    leaving little puddles on the

                                  HARRY

                                  JOAN
                    And smiling on command, because I
                    don't give a damn whether any of
                    you like me or not!!!
                                  VOICE
                           (from above)

                           (yelling up at the
                            copter)
                    Yeah, she's alright!! I've got
                    him!!
                           (gesturing at Eddy)
                    The Westside Slasher, I got him!!

                                  JOAN
                    He's not the Westside Slasher!!

                   Ma'am, is this guy bothering you?

      They both yell up into the blinding light of the search
      beam:


                JOAN                                HARRY
        Will you shut up!!                  I'm not bothering her,
                                            godammit, I love her!!
      Harry lets go of Eddy and leans down to pick up the
      knife, gesturing it at the helicopter:
                                 HARRY
                   Look, you assholes! The guy was
                   holding a knife at her throat!!

                          (from above)
                   Okay, put the knife down, fellow.
      Then to Joan again, taking a step toward her:
                                 HARRY
                   What were you doing, kissing this
                   guy!?

                                 JOAN
                   I wasn't kissing him!!
                                 VOICE
                          (from above)
                   Stand where you are, and put down
                   the knife.


      ON JOAN
      Perceiving the danger to Harry:

                                 JOAN
                   Put the knife down, Harry!

      She grabs the knife out of his hand, throws it away, then
      places her arms around him, desperately pantomiming to
      the helicopter:

                   See? He's not hurting me! He's

       MUSIC OVER: Adele in her shorts and halter top, attends
       the barbecue, a spatula in her hand. As though someone
       had just addressed her by her rightful name, she suddenly
       turns to look IN the CAMERA, and happy to be noticed, she
       lays the spatula down and begins to do a hula dance.

       MUSIC OVER: Sturge lights a cigarette, then raises his
       eyes to see:
       Duke, leaping up onto the hood of Eugene's van. He lies
       down and lowers his head to rest on his paws. Then look-
       ing across at Sturge, he raises his lips in a soundless,
       disdainful growl.

       Eugene, arriving late. He moves    down the aisle searching
       for a seat. He has forgotten to    remove the training
       leash from his belt loop and the   tip of it hangs an inch
       or so below the hem of his sport   jacket.

      aisle and seats himself.

      searching for him again and finding him, she smiles.

      He returns her smile. His eyes shine and glisten with
      emotion and an expression of undissembled and openly
      childlike delight takes shape upon his face.

          Hang on, I got this--
          Someone O.S. starts CLINKING a fork against a wine glass. Is

          sitting at the main table, In silhouette, seen from behind,
          lit only by the votives sprinkled along the table: JOHN
          GROGAN and his bride of two hours, JENNY. In response to the
          crowd, they kiss.
          Standing right by them is SEBASTIAN -- tall, good looking,
          rugged type --John's best man.

          Ordering a bunch of guys around, telling who to go where, as

          All right, I'm zooming in. Whoa. Not
          a flosser.

                         JOHN
          Turn it off.
          And as he REACHES for it - WHAM'. He hits another car! The
          camera goes flying. Fumbles. SCREAMS. YELLS.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ!

                         SEBASTIAN
          They're okay! They're getting out.
          Sebastian manages to right the CAMERA and unsteadily films
          John getting out of the car, heading towards the car he hit.
          The passenger door opens and Jenny comes out. She's covered
          in frosting and the remains of a birthday cake which she was
          carrying in her lap. The damaged car is full of balloons.

                         JENNY
          Are you a complete idiot?!

          SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
          And so one of the truly great love
          affairs of the late eighties began.
          In the home video, Jenny advances on John, hurls the rest of
          the cake at him, starts flailing at him with her hands.

          You know you got this.

          I'm John Grogan.

          Wrong. You're John Friggin Grogan
          who's about to get a job.
          She leans over and gives him a big, long kiss.

                         JOHN
          Um, okay, see now I don't wanna get out
          of the car.

          He nods, starts to get out, then pauses.

          Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were
          in college together, and he was always
          talking about South Florida... mostly
          about the women of South Florida, but
          anyway, after my wife and I got married
          we thought it might be nice to come

                         ARNIE

          Your wife's Jenny Havens, right?

                         JOHN
          Well, she does features. I'm more a
          straight news writer. This is a better
          paper for that.

                         ARNIE
          Straight news writer, huh. Meaning you
          think you're a reporter?

                         JOHN
          Meaning I know I am.

                         ARNIE
          And the six other sweaty-palmed college
          grads I'm interviewing today, you think
          you're better than them?

                         JOHN
          No, sir. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm
          not. But I do know that I always seem
          to surprise myself. Ten years ago, I
          was doing bong hits and playing Donkey
          Kong, never dreamed I'd get into
          college. But I did, and I graduated
          with honors. Two years ago, my buddies
          told me that the most Jenny Havens
          would ever say to me was, You're sweet,
          but I don't like you in that way.. But
          she did like me in that way-- and my
          buddies can suck it because I married
          her. I certainly never thought I'd win
          some award with a dumbass name--

          Exactly sir. But i surprised myself
          and I won it. And if you give me the
          chance, I'm pretty sure I'll surprise
          you, too.
          Arnie considers him a moment.

                         ARNIE
          That's quite a speech, son. You

          YOU GOT THE JOB!
          She gets out of the car and the two embrace right there on
          the street. She takes out her notebook, crosses something
          off on her "list."

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          okay... "Jobs." Done.

          Forget it. It's good, John. It's got
          facts, some color. It's a solid piece.

          Yeah, you and I once talked about doing
          something like that. We were gonna call
          it, "From Plant to Pusher." Remember?

                         SEBASTIAN
          Not really.

                         ARNIE

                         HEY-- GORGAN--

                         (JOHN LOOKS)
          --there was another fire at the county
          dump. Some kinda methane leak.

                         JOHN
          Actually, it's Grogan--

                         ARNIE
          I want two paragraphs for the blotter.

          John nods, looks off at Sebastian who now sits down at his
          cluttered desk, pulls a DUFFLE BAG from under his desk. John
          watches with envy as Sebastian starts stuffing cameras,
          recorders, a bowie knife, into the duffle...

                         JOHN
          So uh, what kind of puppy?
          Sebastian looks up at him.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          To, y'know, cut the wire.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Get her a lab. They're supposed to be
          just like little kids. But easier to
          train.

          As John and Jenny get out of the car. She looks at the house.

                         JENNY
          This isn't the ihop...

                         JOHN
          A little surprise first...

                         20

          20 INT. DOG BREEDER'S HOUSE - DAY

          John is leading Jenny, her eyes closed, through a house
          towards the kitchen. LORI, 55, leathery and smoking, is
          going in front.

                         LORI
          Sorry about the smell.

                         JENNY
          When can I look?

                         JOHN
          Just hang on...
          Lori opens a door to a laundry room.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Okay. Now.
          Jenny opens her eyes and sees a utility room. Nine yellow
          yipping Lab puppies tumble out of a cardboard box towards
          John and Jenny.

          Happy Birthday.

                         JENNY
          Oh my God... they're adorable...

                         (THEN)
          Wait a minute, my birthday's a month
          from now.

                         LORI
          That's okay, they can't leave for
          another three weeks anyway.

                         JENNY
          John, we never even talked about this.

                         JOHN
          You're right. Let's go.
          He's kidding. And besides, Jenny's already on the floor,
          letting the puppies climb all over her.

                         JENNY
          Look at you guys...

                         LORI
          I got papers on the mom and the dad, so
          you can register these.

                         JOHN
          Is the father here too?

                         LORI

                         (HESITATING BRIEFLY)
          Oh, yeah, somewhere. Anyway, girls are
          $400, boys are $375. Except this
          little guy here.

                          AND
          She points to one male puppy, who is clearly the goofiest
          most excited.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
          You can have him for $325.

                         JENNY
          How sweet. He's on clearance...

                         LORI
          Well, he's a little too stocky for the
          breed, so he probably won't show.

                         JENNY
          He's so sweet...

          John, I don't know if I'm ready for a

                         PUPPY--

                         LORI
          You have to wait three weeks for the
          litter to get weaned, before you can
          bring 'em home anyway.

                         JOHN
          Plenty of time to get ready.

                         JENNY
          I won't even be here. I'm gonna be with
          my sister then...

                         JOHN
          No problem. I can take him. Be good
          bonding time. Get him all trained in
          time for you to come home.
          A chuckle from Lori.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Let's give 'em all the scare test.

                         LORI

                         (STOPS CHUCKLING)
          The what?

                         JOHN
          I hear the best dog in the litter is
          the one who doesn't spook easily. They
          turn out to be the most people-
          centered.

                         LORI

                         (SLIGHTLY WORRIED)
          Uh, how are you gonna--
          John turns away, and then suddenly turns back with a loud
          step and a "BOO"! All of the puppies scatter. Lily barks.
          But Clearance Puppy just leaps onto his shoes, his tail
          wagging.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
          Well, that's your guy.
          John scoops him up. Clearance Puppy licks his face. John
          hands him to Jenny. She lets him lick her face...

                         JOHN
          Meant to be.
          He watches her cuddle the puppy and knows he's done the right
          thing.

          21 EXT. LORI'S HOUSE -- DAY 21

          Lori waves goodbye, check in her hand, as John and Jenny walk
          to the car. Jenny carries a Polaroid of Clearance Puppy.

                         JENNY
          You really sure about this? I mean, a
          puppy's a lot of work.

                         JOHN
          How hard could it be?
          We hear A COMMOTION is coming from the woods, something
          crashing through the brush, breathing heavily. They both
          freeze as the sound comes their way.

                         JENNY
          What's that?
          Just then they are nearly knocked off their feet by a huge,
          rampaging Labrador, soaking wet, covered with mud and burrs.
          It circles them, barking WILDLY, a crazed look in its eye. It
          jumps up on John, muddies his shirt, then barrels past Lori
          into the house, knocking over a chair on the porch as it
          goes. A beat.

                         JOHN
          I think we just met the dad.

          22 EXT. AIRPORT - DAY 22

          John kissing Jenny good-bye. They finally part...

                         JENNY
          Call me as soon as you get him home.
          Oh, hey, we need a name.

                         JOHN
          How 'bout I just call him "Clearance
          Puppy" until you get back. I only hope
          he doesn't say his first word without
          you.

          23 EXT. LORI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John steps out of his car and the puppy, now twice the size
          he was three weeks ago, bounds over to him. A harried Lori
          follows, a rope leash and instruction. sheet in hand.

                         JOHN
          Whoa! He got big... This is the right
          one, right?

                         LORI
          You should see him pack away the puppy
          chow.

                         JOHN
          So, what if I run into any problems?

                         LORI

                         (BACKING AWAY)
          Oh. Sure, call me. All sales are
          final, though. Not just for him. I
          tell that to everyone.

                         (QUICKLY)
          You want help getting him in the car?

                         JOHN
          No, that's okay, I'll just...
          John opens the door, indicates that Marley should jump in.
          Instead, the puppy runs around the car, barking, jumping up
          on the bumpers. John finally catches him, lifts him up, puts
          him on the front passenger seat atop some towels.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          There we go.

                         (TURNS)
          Well, anyway, thanks for--
          But Lori's already inside her house, the door closed.

          24 INT. JOHN'S CAR - NIGHT 24

          John and the puppy on the drive home. The puppy atop a pile
          of towels. John looks at him.

                         JOHN
          Hey... guy.
          The dog just stares at him quizzically. Uncomfortable alone
          with the dog, John turns on the radio. BOB MARLEY plays and
          the puppy THUMPS HIS TAIL.

          You like Bob Marley?
          The dog THUMPS HIS TAIL AGAIN. John turns up the music.
          THUMP. THUMP. THUMP faster this time.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                         GOOD BOY--

          Marley.

          THUMP THUMP THUMP.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Marley. Okay-- Marley. Cool.
          But now the pup starts wriggling towards John, John tries to
          put him back...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          No-- stay boy... stay.
          (the dog crawls into his lap)
          Okay, not really safe, bud--
          Marley gets stuck with half his body draped over the console.
          He remains like this, his tail thumping... John gives up.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           Alright, fine, but just this time.

           THUMP. THUMP.

          This is our house...
          The dog immediately pees on the ground.

          This one's water. This one's food.

          C'mon, man, you've already had kibble
          and half a seat belt.
          (moment, relents)
          All right. Special treat. But just
          today...
          He opens the bag and Marley tackles it. Several cupfuls
          spill onto the floor. John goes to the pantry to get the
          dustpan and brush. When he returns, he finds Marley has
          eaten the food in the bowl AND every last scrap of spilled
          food. And now he's squatting to pee again...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          No, no, no!
          He picks up the puppy and rushes him outside.

          As John sets him down on the ground, steps back.

          Okay, now. Pee.
          He motions with his zipper.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          C'mon, man, do your thing.
          (Marley just stares)
          Alright, I'm gonna show you this one
          time...
          From behind, we see John peeing.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Except you gotta lift your leg.
          (lifts his leg)
          See, this is how you guys do it...
          Marley looks at him, squats and pees...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Or you could do it like that. Just not
          in front of other guy dogs.

          Jenny's on the phone. Her young NIECE and NEPHEW wait for
          her, a board game on the floor between them. She motions
          that she'll just be a second...

          John's on the phone, talking to Jenny as he follows Marley
          around the room, trying to keep shoes and socks and cords out
          of his mouth...

                         JOHN
          Oh, yeah, he's pooped.
          Marley lets out a SQUEAK as he tugs at a couch cushion...

                         JENNY

                         (HEARS IT)
          Oh, he sounds so sweet!

                         JOHN
          Yeah...
          (snapping his fingers at the
          dog, shaking his head "no")
          He's very cute. Just like a little kid
          only furrier.

                         JENNY
          Put the phone by his ear...
          John chases after the dog who burrows under the couch, his
          tail sticking out so that John can't get him...

                         JOHN
          Uh, okay, he's listening.
          John just holds the phone awkwardly as Jenny coos baby talk.

                         JENNY
          (into the phone)
          Hey, Marley! Who's my good boy?!
          Mommy can't wait to meet you...

                         JOHN
          Anyway, don't worry, he's doing great.
          Like he's lived here his whole life.
          All eight weeks of it. And you know
          what else? I think he's going to be
          pretty easy to train. I mean, he's
          curious which means he's smart, right?

                         JENNY
          Of course he is. I can't wait to see
          him.

                         JOHN
          Just him?

                         JENNY
          Jealous?

                         JOHN
          I'm not the one sleeping in a box.

                         JENNY
          I love you. I'll see you Friday.

          30 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 30

          John, dressed to go out, is setting down Marley in his wooden
          box on the garage floor.

                         JOHN
          I'll see you in the morning, okay?
          Marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression. John
          hesitates.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Aw, come on, don't. You'll be fine,
          alright. And tomorrow, we're gonna
          tear it up. I'm thinking kibble, park,
          chew toy, the whole nine yards. Okay?
          we good?
          Marley doesn't-look so good, looks kind of sad. John turns
          and gets out of there.

          31 EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 31

          John gets into his car. He can hear WHIMPERING.

                         JOHN
          Big day tomorrow! Rest up, pal!
          He listens a beat; Marley quiets down. He gets in his car.

                         

                         

                         

                         
             25.

          32 INT. BAR - NIGHT 32

          Journalist hang out.'John and Sebastian at the bar. Many know
          Sebastian, he's constantly nodding at people throughout:

                         SEBASTIAN
          So I'm there in this cave, right?
          Blindfolded. And I can feel the
          machine guns, there's like nine of 'em
          around me... and they tie me to a chair
          and then Escobar comes in and says--
          are you ready?

                         (SPANISH ACCENT)
          I read your piece on Kadahfi, And I
          think you captured his narcissism just
          right.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Can you believe that?

                         JOHN
          Some of it.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Man, I wish you could've been there.

                         JOHN
          Yeah, but then I wouldn't have been
          able to do the piece on the water main
          break at the library. That would have
          sucked.

                         SEBASTIAN
          (hand on John's shoulder)
          Your time will come, amigo.

                         JOHN
          I'll drink to that--
          They toast with their beers, Sebastian clocks John looking at
          his watch.

                         SEBASTIAN
          You gotta be somewhere?

                         JOHN
          Oh. No, it's the puppy. It's his first

                         NIGHT ALONE--

                         SEBASTIAN
          You got adoc?



                         

                         

                         

                         
            26.

                         32 CONTINUED:

                         JOHN
          Marley. A little lab. Like you said.
          Remember? The bomb...

                         SEBASTIAN
          Oh, right. Smart move. You'll see.
          (slaps him on the back)
          You've just preserved your quiet way of
          life for at least another two years.

                         33

          33 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD -- NIGHT

          John pulls up, gets out of his car. Halfway down the block,
          we see a POLICE CAR, lights flashing, two OFFICERS talking to
          a COUPLE. Another NEIGHBOR, in his robe, stands in the
          street watching...

                         NEIGHBOR
          Millers got robbed again.
          (then, turns to John)
          And that mutt of yours hasn't shut up
          since you left.
          John looks towards the garage where we hear WHIMPERING.

          34 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - GARAGE - NIGHT 34

          The door opens and the puppy gets excited--

                         JOHN
          No no... I just wanted you to know I'm
          back.
          The puppy whimpers and he goes over to him, reaches into the
          box and pets him...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Buddy, you really gotta chill, okay?
          Yeah, I know, good to see you, too.
          But I'm just inside the house, I'll see
          you in the morning. Big day tomorrow.
          Get some sleep.

          35 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - NIGHT 35

          John gulps orange juice from the bottle. Leaves a quarter-
          inch, puts it back in the fridge. And now we hear BARKING
          from the Garage.

                         

                         

                         

                         
             27.

          36 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BATHROOM - NIGHT 36

          Water running. John swallows some preventative aspirin,
          picks some nachos off his shirt. He turns off the water.
          And we hear WAILING and KEENING coming from the garage.

          37 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT 37

          John has his head buried under the pillows AS THE WAILING AND
          KEENING GO ON. AND ON. AND ON. Finally, John can't take it
          anymore. He sits up, pulls earplugs out of his ears.

                         38

          38 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

          As the light comes on and Marley's head appears over the top
          of the box. John sighs, comes over and scoops him up...

          39 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT 39

          John gets Marley settled in the box, now by the side of the
          bed.

                         JOHN
          Just this one time.
          John climbs into bed, shuts off the light. Marley whimpers
          and John rolls onto his stomach, reaches into the box and
          strokes his back, the puppy lays down, still whimpers...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Oh, come on...

                         (THEN)
          Hey. Remember this?
          (half drunk, sings badly)
          One love, one heart...

                         (MARLEY QUIETS)
          Let's get together and feel alright...
          John nods off, one arm hanging over the side of the bed into
          the box, his hand resting on Marley's back as the puppy now
          snoozes peacefully and we then...

          FADE OUT.

          AN ALARM CLOCK SOUNDS.

          40 FADE IN: CLOSE-UP OF MARLEY'S FACE 40
          Tail rising in the b.g., wagging.

          REVEAL: BEDROOM - MORNING

                         40 CONTINUED:
          As John opens his eyes to see Marley snuggled up against his
          face. Marley's eyes looking into his. John reaches over the
          puppy and shuts off the alarm.

                         JOHN
          She comes home today.
          Hung over, he sits up, looks around the messy room, half due
          to John's bachelor housekeeping habits, half due to Marley.
          Not only has everything has been chewed, but some time during
          the night Marley discovered how much fun toilet paper is.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          We should probably clean up.

          41 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 41

          John vacuums, struggles to empty the bag, puts a broken vase
          in the trash, does the dishes, etc. Marley follows him, tail
          wreaking havoc, knocking over everything that isn't nailed
          down. John picks up the HUGE CHEW TOY he'd just bought and
          examines it as Marley runs into the bathroom...

                         JOHN
          Huh.
          It's already completely gnawed up. John looks at Marley who
          emerges dragging a roll of toilet paper, rams right into the
          screen door, bounces back.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Marley, it's a screen, you're not gonna

                         GET THROUGH--
          Meanwhile, Marley backs up a few steps, gets a head of steam,
          then rams into it again, this time goes right through it.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          --there.

          42 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 42

          John gets drenched as he gives Marley a bath.

          43 INT. GARAGE - DAY 43

          John drags Marley into the garage.

                         JOHN
          I'll be back in an hour. Be good.

                         44

          44 EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

          A bit of THUNDER as John comes out with a bag of groceries
          and a bunch of flowers. He gets to the car just as the rain
          hits.

                         45

          45 EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

          As John and Jenny kiss outside the terminal. She holds a
          stuffed "Pluto."

                         JENNY
          How's my puppy?

                         JOHN
          I'm okay. A little tired, but

                         OTHERWISE--
          She nudges him. He gives her another kiss.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          He's waiting for you.

          46 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - DRIVEWAY - DAY 46

          John and Jenny get out of the car. We hear WHIMPERING in the
          garage.

                         JENNY
          Marley!
          She takes off for the side door of the garage.

          47 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - GARAGE - DAY 47

          They open the door and freeze.

                         JENNY
          Oh my God.
          It's a mess. It's almost incredible that it's all due to a
          single puppy. The box is in shreds; so are the blankets. A
          puddle of urine on the floor. A large piece of dry wall has
          been chewed off near the big garage door. The garbage cans
          are overturned. Marley is whimpering in the corner.

                         JOHN
          Wow. Okay, this is not how I left it.

                         JENNY
          How long has he been in here?

          An hour, at the most.
          (looks around, then)
          Jeez... he Alg drywall. That's just not
          right.

                         JENNY
          (she picks him up)
          Look. He's shaking--
          Another bit of THUNDER and the puppy whimpers louder.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          Does thunder scare you, Mister? Hm?
          He licks her face, snuggles into her. She gives him the
          Pluto stuffed animal. She hugs him...

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          Look at us.
          She looks up at John and smiles. He returns the smile.
          Mission accomplished.

          48 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 48

          As Marley bursts out of the back bedroom with one of Jenny's
          bras in his mouth.

                         JENNY
          Marley, no!
          Jenny chases him into the kitchen, past John who holds up the
          newspaper...

                         JOHN
          He gave me an extra paragraph...
          Marley bursts through the back screen door...

          49 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - DAY 49

          A seemingly continuous shot, except that it's now A SIX MONTH
          OLD MARLEY who comes through the screen into the backyard now
          clutching a set of curtains in his mouth, still attached to
          the rod, and it's now JOHN who stumbles through the broken
          wire mesh to chase after him...

                         JOHN
          Marley, no!
          John chases him across the backyard. Marley goes under the
          fence and John starts to go over into...

          And now it's a NINE MONTH OLD MARLEY who comes up from under
          the fence clutching a THANKSGIVING TURKEY in his mouth. And
          now it's Jenny AND John who go over the fence chasing him...

                         JOHN
          Marley, no!
          They wave to the NEIGHBOR standing on his patio watching.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Hi, Tom-- Sorry...

                         JENNY
          Happy Thanksgiving...
          Marley goes through a hedge and out onto...

          51 EXT. STREET - DAY 51

          Where Marley emerges into FRAME a FULL GROWN DOG, rapidly
          pulling Jenny by the leash along the intercoastal waterway.
          We track with him until a WOMAN WALKING A POODLE IS NOW IN
          FRAME and Marley gets the two women entangled as he starts
          humping the smaller dog...

                         JENNY
          Marley, no!

                         52

          52 INT. SUN-SENTINEL - ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

          John sits across from Arnie. He looks thrown:

                         JOHN
          I don't understand, why me?

                         ARNIE
          I'm in a bind, John.

                         JOHN
          But I'm a reporter, not a columnist.

                         ARNIE
          It's a step up.

                         JOHN
          Yeah, but it's a step away from what I
          wanna do.

                         ARNIE
          It's also better pay, you set your own
          hours, pick your own topics...

                         (MORE)

          and it's only temporary, just until I
          find someone permanent.

                         JOHN
          What happened to Jerry?

                         ARNIE
          You may have noticed that in every
          other column, he went on about The Pie
          Palace?

                         JOHN
          I really haven't read his--

                         ARNIE
          Turns out he's been getting free meals
          in exchange for mentioning the joint.
          It's also why he became such a fat ass.
          John nods. Oh.

                         ARNIE (CONT'D)
          Anyway, it's twice a week. And like I
          said, it's only until I can find
          someone else to replace him. Then
          you're back on, uh... whatever beat you
          were on.

          53 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 53


                         17-
          John pulls up, gets out of the car. His neighbors, The
          year-old GIRL -- short blue hair, pierced eyebrow -- and her
          MOM -- in a nurses uniform -- unload groceries from the car.

                         GIRL
          Your dog's funny.

                         JOHN

                         (PAUSES)
          Uh, thanks.

                         GIRL
          He tried to eat one of our tires.

                         JOHN
          Yeah, well, dogs need rubber. Little
          known fact, helps the digestive
          tract...

                         GIRL
          Right. Along with the occasional black
          Converse high top which I'd still love
          to get back by the way.



                         

                         

                         

                         
            33.

                         53

                         53 CONTINUED:

                         JOHN
          I'll do what I can.

                         GIRL
          'Preciate that.

                         54

          54 INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          John sits at the table scribbling on a legal pad. He tears
          off the sheet and crumples it up, throws it across the room.
          Marley bounds into the room, Jenny behind him, sweating.

                         JENNY
          I think he dislocated my shoulder. He
          doesn't heel-- hell, he doesn't even
          walk, he sprints, and I had to pull him
          off three dogs...

                         JOHN
          Poodle?

                         JENNY
          Yeah, among others. There was a
          Yorkie, a Dalmatian and a bichon frise
          that may never be right again.
          (sees the legal pad)
          What're you doing?

                         JOHN
          Arnie gave me a column.

                         JENNY
          You're kidding? Congratulations!

                         JOHN
          Oh, yeah, it's a big honor. I get to
          write about zoning laws and yard sales.

                         JENNY
          I bet you make something out of it.

                         JOHN
          It's only temporary until he finds
          someone else. I'm just trying to get
          something down for Tuesday.
          She gives him a kiss, starts out of the room

                         JENNY
          You'll think of something. And John,
          I'm serious abut Marley. He wreaks
          havoc everywhere he goes. We gotta do
          something...

                         

                         

                         

                         
            34.

                         55

          55 EXT. PARK - DAY

          MS. KORNBLUT, weathered and stern, is studying John. Behind
          John, eight puppies and their owners are chatting before the
          class begins.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          Incorrigible? I don't believe in that.
          All dogs want to learn. But they can't
          when their owners are weak-willed.

                         JOHN
          I'm very strong-willed.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          And where is your animal?

                         JOHN
          He's over there. With my wife. He was
          a little excited. He usually needs a
          little time to calm down.
          Ms. Kornblut looks at Jenny as she struggles up with Marley.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          I see. He calls the shots. Which of
          you will be the trainer?

                         JENNY
          we thought we both would, since we want
          him to listen to both of us at home -

          MS. KORNBLUT
          A dog can only answer to one master.
          Which one of you has the most natural
          authority in your own relationship?

                         JOHN

                         (BEAT)
          I'll watch.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          I thought so. We begin.

          56 EXT. PARK - LATER 56

          As Ms. Kornblut gestures, demonstrates the command:

          MS. KORNBLUT
          Sit!



                         

                         

                         

                         
            35.

                         56

                         56 CONTINUED:
          The students order their dogs to sit, and most of them do.
          The ones that don't require only a little effort to get the
          idea. Whereas:
          Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her
          and puts his paws on her shoulders. She presses his butt to
          the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub. She tries to
          tug him into place and he grabs the leash in his teeth,
          shaking it playfully.

          MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
          That, class, is an example of a dog
          that has been foolishly allowed to
          believe he is the alpha male of his
          pack. And therefore he cannot be a
          happy animal.

                         JOHN
          (from the sidelines)
          Yeah, he looks really bummed.
          Kornblut hears him, death stares John.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          You. Joker. Rotate in.
          John looks at Jenny who shrugs, holds up the leash for him to
          take.

          57 CUT TO: A HEAVY CHOKE CHAIN 57
          As Ms. Kornblut demonstrates on her wrist.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          The choke chain. When your animal
          walks properly by your side, there'll
          be slack. If he pulls, it tightens
          around his neck like a noose and
          loosens as soon as he stops pulling.

                         JOHN
          Does it hurt them?

          MS. KORNBLUT
          Well, it's not called a hug chain. But
          they learn to like it. Go on, collar
          your dogs.
          Everyone else quickly, easily gets the choke chain around
          their dogs' necks. Of course. Meanwhile:
          John kneels down and struggles to put it. around Marley's
          neck. Marley, liking its shiny jingling, tries to eat it.



                         

                         

                         

                         
             36.

                         57 CONTINUED: 57
          Much tussling, and John finally gets it around Marley's neck -
          but Marley still manages to grab it in his teeth.

                         JOHN
          He likes it.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          That's because he's eating it... Get it
          out of his mouth. Class? Give your
          dogs the sit command.
          All the dogs sit; John forces Marley's butt down.

          MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
          The leash is held in two places. Loop
          around your right hand, left hand at
          waist level. Dog always on your left,
          of course.

                         JOHN
          That means us, pal.
          He rearranges Marley so he's on John's left.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          Now, when you give the heel command,
          step off with your left foot - I don't
          want to see any right foot first
          steppers - and walk. If your dog gets
          ahead, administer a correction by
          forcefully bring your left hand down
          and towards the right, and he'll
          respond. Shall we? One, two, three -
          now!
          Just as the dogs and owners prepare to step off, Marley
          lurches ahead of the pack...

                         JOHN
          Marley, heel!
          Marley takes off like a fighter jet, dragging John behind.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          Correct him!
          John gives a mighty yank on the leash. Marley coughs,
          hesitates. John loosens the leash - and Marley explodes
          forward again. John yanks, Marley stops, John releases,
          Marley explodes forward.



                         

                         

                         

                         
             37.

                         57 CONTINUED: (2) 57

          MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
          Rein in that dog! All right, everyone,
          line up again. Demonstration. Mr.
          Grogan? Pay attention.
          She takes the leash from John and efficiently guides him into
          line with the other dogs.

          MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
          It's a simple question of confidence in
          one's own authority. Shall I
          demonstrate a simple walk?

                         JOHN
          Be my guest.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          Class? Even an unruly dog wants to
          obey his leader. Marley? Heel.
          And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more
          confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back
          on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward.
          Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park.
          She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process
          begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her
          face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but
          Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a
          walking tug-of-war.
          With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to
          John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping
          her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down,
          and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee.
          John and Jenny rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps
          up Mrs. Kornblut. She's livid.

          MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
          That's it! He's out!

                         JOHN
          He usually just does this with poodles.
          (looking at her bad perm)
          Maybe it's the hair.

          MS. KORNBLUT
          He's a bad influence on the others.
          Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes
          hold in a group - he has to go!

          58 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY

          As they follow Marley back into the house.

                         JOHN
          Well, that was fun.
          (to the dog)
          Congratulations, Marley. You flunked
          obedience school.

                         JENNY
          You know, John, there is something else
          we can do--

                         JOHN
          (looks at her)
          No, no, I'm not doing that to him.

                         JENNY
          It's painless. And he'll be a lot more
          comfortable. It'll calm him down.

                         JOHN
          Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer?
          Because he'll have nothing to look
          forward to.

                         JENNY
          What're you talking about? There are
          plenty of other things that'll make him

                         HAPPY--

                         JOHN
          That's where you're wrong. Trust me,
          Jen: I know. I'm a guy. And yeah,
          lots of things make us happy, but the
          only thing we really look forward to is
          sex. Runner up: the possibility of
          sex.

                         JENNY
          Oh, Please. Every book says he'll live

                         LONGER--

                         JOHN
          It'll just feel longer.

                         JENNY
          John, he's out of control. It's the
          right thing to do.
          John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed
          "goofy" that Jenny gave him as a puppy.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            39.

                         59

          59 INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY

          Jenny at the wheel. John in the passenger seat. Marley in the
          back, his front paws balanced on the center console.

                         JOHN
          It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see.
          Sex is overrated.
          Marley looks-at him.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know
          that... so maybe the best thing is to
          just not talk about it.
          Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Poor son-of-a-bitch.
          A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins
          listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff
          of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto John's lap...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here...
          Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to
          catch the fresh air

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Least I can do.
          John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Here you go...
          John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole
          head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like
          he's drunk.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          He's so happy. He has no idea what's
          about to happen to him.
          Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open
          window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of
          the car.

                         JENNY
          He's making me nervous.

          He's fine. He just wants a little

                         FRESH--
          Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out the window until
          his front armpits are resting on the glass.

                         JENNY
          John, grab him!
          Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and
          scrambling out the window of the moving car.

                         JOHN
          He's onto our evil plan, and he's
          making a break for it!
          But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing for
          a foothold...

                         60

          60 EXT. INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY BRIDGE - SAME

          As Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the
          window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand
          so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his
          tail... He trots along the pavement with his front paws...

                         61

          61 INT. CAR - SANE

          Jenny gets the car stopped, HORNS HONKING BEHIND THEM.

                         JOHN
          Uh, little help here...
          John's stuck. He can't pull the dog back in the window and he
          can't open the door. He can't let go as angry drivers behind
          them are now starting to swerve around them. John hangs on
          for dear life...

                         JENNY
          I got him!

                         62

          62 EXT. BRIDGE - SAME

          As Jenny puts on the flashers and gets out of the car, runs
          around to the passenger side... a group of cars drive slowly
          by in the other direction, all watching and laughing...

                         JOHN

                         (SHOUTING)
          What are you looking at?! He's losing
          his balls today! Cut the guy some
          slack!

          John sits at his desk, tries to write a column. Sebastian, in
          a flak jacket, pauses at his desk...

          You up for a beer?

                         JOHN
          Can't, I gotta finish the column.
          Maybe tomorrow?

                         SEBASTIAN
          Can't, I'll be in L.A. Part of that
          drug piece I'm doing--

                         JOHN
          Right. Another time then.
          John watches him move off, a secretary giving Sebastian a big
          smile as he passes. John sits there another moment, looks at
          his desk. A photo of him and Jenny. One of Marley with a flip
          flop in his mouth.
          John chuckles to himself, then deletes the column, starts
          typing a new one.

          64 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - LATER 64

          John sits anxiously across from Arnie who sits at his desk
          reading. The editor's expression is grim as he looks up at
          John.

                         JOHN
          I'm really sorry, I'll go back and do
          the zoning piece--

                         ARNIE
          The hell you sorry for? It's
          hilarious.
          John sits back down, looks at Arnie. See, the thing is,
          Arnie's face doesn't say "hilarious," but...

          "Great Escape," all of it. Hysterical.
          Again, Arnie's face remains dead serious as he passes the
          paper back to John.

                         ARNIE (CONT'D)
          Run it. As is.

                         JOHN

          John starts out of the office.

          Hey, Gorgan...

                         (THEN)
          Tell him not to feel bad. Sooner or

          Live music, a sexy vibe. John and Jenny sit outside in the
          hot Florida night. Dinner over, John raises his glass...

          Good, though, right?

                         JENNY
          Really good.
          He lifts out of his chair and kisses her, a long one.

                         JOHN
          So. What's next?

                         JENNY
          I was thinking desert.

          Yeah.

                         JENNY
          well, it was between a new roof and a
          baby.
          He studies her for a long moment, then...

                         JOHN
          I can probably live with a few leaks.

                         JENNY
          Really? Because a leak can turn into
          something bigger... and that can be a
          big responsibility.

                         JOHN
          I know.

                         JENNY
          I was just thinking that we might want
          everything fixed before we went to the
          next step.

                         JOHN
          Well, we've already fixed Marley.

          Okay. Maybe, instead of tying to have
          a baby, we should stop trying to not
          have one.

          You said I could push the button!

                         FATHER
          Alright, okay, I'll just--
          He tries to pick her up without leaning over...

                         GIRL
          Ow! You're hurting me!

                         FATHER
          Okay, you know what? Never mind, no
          button!
          A very uncomfortable John now steps forward...

                         JOHN
          You want me to give her a hand?

                         FATHER
          Oh-- would you mind?
          John lifts the girl up to the panel. She runs her hands,
          from top to button, down the panel, pressing every single
          button.

                         FATHER (CONT'D)
          Sarah! Goddammit--

          And now the little girl starts bawling in concert with the
          baby, while a trapped John backs up into the corner.

                         71

          71 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY

          John gets out of the car. The young Girl next door gives him
          a wave as she starts down the sidewalk with her boyfriend.

                         JOHN
          Hi.

                          GIRL
           Hi.
           John watches the young couple go, arms around each other.

                          72

          72 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY

          John enters and is greeted as usual by Marley who jumps on
          him.

                         JOHN
          Hey, boy.

                         (LOOKS AROUND)
          Jenny?

                         JENNY
          Out in a sec!
          John stands there, Marley looking at him.

                         JOHN
          (to the dog)
          So. This is us not trying.
          The bathroom door opens and Jenny walks out in a tiny, silky
          two-piece thing...

                         JENNY
          Hey, Sailor.
          She walks into the bedroom. John looks back at Marley as he
          follows her into the bedroom.

                         JOHN
          Catch you later, buddy.
          And closes the door on the dog.

          John and Sebastian sit at the bar.

          So the puppy wasn't enough?

                         JOHN
          Well, technically, we're not trying.
          But you know Jenny.

                         SEBASTIAN
          But things are good right now, just as
          they are, right?

                         JOHN
          Yeah, things are really good.

                         SEBASTIAN
          So why change it up with a kid? I
          mean, have you already forgotten my
          little cautionary tale...

                         JOHN
          The bomb, right?

                         SEBASTIAN
          Yes. The bomb. And just so we're
          clear, the countdown sequence has been
          reactivated. By you.

                         JOHN
          Well, it's been a few months and
          nothing's happened. Which actually
          makes me wonder if--

                         BARTENDER
          Mr. Grogan?
          The BARTENDER sets a PHONE down in front of John.

                         BARTENDER (CONT'D)
          Phone call. I loved that thing you did
          on your dog watching you and your wife
          have sex? Really funny stuff...

                         JOHN

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Thanks...

                         BARTENDER
          Seriously, man, your stuff is classic.

                         JOHN
          Well, it's just temporary, but thanks.
          John cuts a look at Sebastian, picks up the phone.

          Hello.

                         JENNY (PHONE)
          I just wanted to let you know that
          there's a naked blonde in your bed.

                         JOHN
          Oh. Why don't you two get started and
          I'll be there as soon as I can.

                         JENNY
          Very funny. Can you come home? I'll
          make it worth your while.

                         JOHN
          Oh. Alright then. I'll see what I can
          do.
          He hangs up. Looks at Sebastian.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Uh, I'm sorry, man, but I gotta jam. I
          forgot, I had this thing, I gotta deal

                         WITH--

                         SEBASTIAN
          She's calling you home, isn't she?

                         JOHN
          Yeah. See you later.
          John starts out of the bar. Sebastian calls after him.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Tick tick tick!

          74 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT

          Romantic Music on the stereo. John comes in, wearily,
          absently pets Marley. He goes into the bedroom. The
          bathroom door is open. John sits down on the bed.

                         JOHN
          You know, this baby thing. I been
          thinking maybe we should take a break.
          You know? Obviously, it's not
          happening. Maybe that's nature's way
          of saying it's not good timing.
          No sound from Jenny. He struggles on.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
          Maybe this is a sign that we're not
          ready for this. I mean, have we really
          thought this through? Because--

                         BEHIND
          He looks up to see Jenny at the bathroom door. From
          her back she brings out a home pregnancy test strip.

                         JENNY
          I'm pregnant.

                         JOHN
          (PAUSE, then)
          Great. Wow, that's... great.

                         JENNY
          But you just said

                         JOHN
          Yeah, no, I mean-- okay, this is
          definitely awkward now, but...

                         JENNY
          You wanna start over?

                         JOHN
          Can I?

                         JENNY
          By all means.

                         JOHN
          Thank you. Okay, well... I gotta be
          honest, I'm a little panicked.

                         JENNY
          Are you panicking because I'm
          pregnant... or because you're afraid
          I'm going to hit you?

                         JOHN
          Both. It's a twofer thing.

                         JENNY
          Are you scared?

                         JOHN
          No. No. Not at all.
          (then, looks at her)
          Yeah, yeah I'm pretty scared.

                         (THEN)
          Look at me...

                         JOHN
          That's probably the last one about
          Marley for a while. But in about nine
          months, I'm gonna have a new subject,
          might be just as fun. Jenny's
          pregnant.

          I'm very happy for you. Have you

                         JOHN
          What?

                         ARNIE
          A gift, John. She's carrying a child.
          Your child. Don't you think that's
          worth something?

                         JOHN
          Uhhh...

                         ARNIE
          You don't wanna make the mistake I did.
          Listen to me. There's gonna come a
          time, she's fat, she's nauseous, her
          ankles are swollen, and she's gonna
          look at you, and this is what that look
          will mean: "You bastard. You did this
          to me. You dick, you ruined me." But

          Oh, John, it's beautiful...
          She sets it down on the coffee table, then moves close to

                         JENNY
          That is so sweet.

                         JOHN
          Put it on...

          Where'd it go? It was right here.

          Marley stands a few feet away, looking strangely gleeful. A
          glint of Gold in the moonlight dangles from his mouth. They
          both get up, start to move towards him...

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          Hey, boy. Come here. Look what I got
          for you.

          We don't want any trouble...

          Yeah, here's a little something--
          (imaginary) treat. Marley
          She reaches into her pocket for an moves
          looks at her. Is this a trick? He considers. Then he
          closer. John tiptoes up behind him, ever so slowly.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          I just want to give you a treat and a
          big kiss. That's a boy...
          Inch by inch, Marley approaches her. But then, behind
          Marley, John knocks against a table. Marley freezes.

                         JOHN
          He made me! Go!
          Jenny lurches for Marley, going for his collar, and John
          leaps at him from behind. Marley skitters away. Ah, a game!
          He wags his tail, prances, sticks his rear in the air and his
          puts his head to the ground. John feints, tries to maneuver
          Marley back into Jenny.
          Jenny finally grabs him from behind. John pries open his
          mouth. Nothing. He reaches inside, looks up at Jenny.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           Uh-oh.


          77 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - MORNING

          John grimaces in the morning sun as he watches Marley poop.
          He takes a hose and squirts at the deposit until it runs into
          the lawn. Nothing.

          John hoses through Marley's huge orange iridescent poops.

          Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes.

                         (A SIGH)
          You know, years ago, when I pictured my
          life, somehow standing in my backyard
          hosing down dog crap in search of my
          bride's swallowed and recycled ass-
          kissing gift just didn't spring to
          mind.

          filled with bleach.

                         JENNY
          I think it's shinier than before.
          Amazing.

                         JOHN
          Yeah. He did us a favor. And I only
          threw up eight times.

                         JENNY
          My hero.

          The NURSE arranges the gown on Jenny.

          How's that crazy dog of yours?
          (smiles at John)
          I'm a big fan.

                         JOHN
          Thank you.

                         NURSE
          The heartbeat'll be very fast, like a
          little train. That's normal.

          Is it too soon to tell the sex? Not
          that I care. He can be any sex he
          wants. Male, female, we don't care.
          Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our
          druthers, but whatever...

                         NURSE
          Shhhhh... hang on...
          She listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up
          to a speaker. Nothing.

                         NURSE (CONT'D)
          Sometimes you,can't hear it, depending
          on how the baby is lying.- You're ten
          weeks, right?

                         JENNY
          Next Monday, yes.

                         NURSE
          Might be a little early for that.
          Let's go right to the sonogram. Did
          you bring your blank tape?

                         JOHN
          (waving it, smiling)
          Ready to roll.

                         NURSE
          Let's get a good picture first. It'll
          be on the monitor there.
          The Nurse begins running the instrument around Jenny's
          stomach. John and Jenny peer at the computer screen.

                         NURSE (CONT'D)

                         (NEUTRAL)
          Hmmm. This one doesn't seem to be
          picking up anything. Excuse me, I'll
          be just a minute...
          She leaves. Jenny and John smile at each other, but inside
          each of them, a small pinpoint of fear starts to expand. We
          wait for a few moments. A pressured silence. And then...
          smiles down at
          DR. SHERMAN comes in, followed by the nurse,
          Jenny.

          DR. SHERMAN
          Hi, guys. Let's have a look at your
          baby, shall we?

          (he takes the instrument)
          All right, there we go. Good. Now,
          look over there. Much better
          resolution, right?
          Jenny and John, holding hands, look at the computer screen.
          They see a sac, which, with a click of the mouse, Dr. Sherman
          expands and expands. But it's empty. Jenny tries to smile.

                         JENNY
          Is there anything in there?

          DR. SHERMAN
          Not what you'd expect to see at ten
          weeks.

                         JENNY
          Not quite ten weeks.
          Dr. Sherman looks at them directly. Kindly:

          DR. SHERMAN
          Jenny, I'm sorry, but there's no
          heartbeat.
          John and Jenny are still, silent.

          DR. SHERMAN (CONT'D)
          One in six pregnancies ends this way.
          it just happens sometimes, that's all.
          I'm very sorry. But you're young and
          healthy and in a couple of months, you
          can try again.

                         (THEN)
          Why don't you come by my office on your
          way out and we can talk some more.
          He exits. John is still holding the blank videotape. He
          tries to hide it from Jenny. He leaves. Jenny and John look
          at each other.

                         JENNY
          How could this happen? What'd I do
          wrong?

                         JOHN
          You didn't do anything--

                         JENNY
          I must have. Otherwise, how could I
          lose it?

          Jenny, it's not something you have any
          control over. It's like the doctor
          said, it just happens--

                         JENNY
          Not to me... I did something wrong. I
          know it... I did something wrong. I'm
          sorry, John...

                         JOHN
          Don't say that--

                         JENNY
          But I am-- I'm sorry--

                         JOHN
          I don't need sorry. You didn't do
          anything!
          She turns away and begins to cry. John just sits there,
          staring at the videotape in his hands.
          Outside in the hall, the door to another examining room opens
          and they hear a couple laughing, talking excitedly.
          Jenny and John look away from each other, their pain made
          even worse.

          John is driving Jenny home.

                         JOHN
          In a couple of months, we can try
          again. Okay?
           Jenny just looks out the window.

          John helps Jenny through the kitchen door. Marley follows
          them, circles them wildly, then stops, puzzled, as he looks
          at them. Jenny goes into the living room; Marley follows
          her.

                         JOHN
          You want some tea?

                         (NO ANSWER)
          Hey, you know what I was thinking? We
          still have those tickets from your
          parents for the honeymoon in Ireland.
          We can finally do that.

          Take some time off. It'll be fun,
          clear our heads, right?

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          Jenny?
          No answer. He goes into the living room and stops cold:

          JOHN'S POV - JENNY & MARLEY
          Jenny sits on the couch. Marley stands at her feet, with his
          shoulders between her knees, his big head resting in her lap.
          His tail hangs flat between his legs. His eyes are turned up
          at her, and he whimpers softly.
          Jenny strokes his head a few times and then, with no warning,
          buries her face in the thick fur of his neck and begins
          sobbing. They stay like that for a moment, Marley statue-
          still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll.
          John stands there, watching Marley take care of her. No
          words, just being there. A lesson here. Her head down,
          Jenny raises one arm up towards John and John goes to the
          couch and wraps his arms around both of them. We then...

          FADE OUT.

          DEBBY (V.O.)
          Oh. He's... big.

          83 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - LIVING ROOM - DAY 83

          With difficulty, John holds back Marley to protect DEBBY ---
          19, glasses, bookish, the house sitter -- from his affection.

                         JOHN
          Yeah. Close to a hundred pounds.
          (re: the leash struggle)
          He just wants to say hi. He won't hurt
          you. Just stand still and be calm.
          You're a dog person, right?

                         DEBBY
          well, actually -

                         JOHN
          - Ready?

                         DEBBY
          okay?
          John releases Marley who springs on Debby, knocking her back.

          He's not supposed to do that. You have
          to knee him. Anyway, it won't happen
          the whole time. Just maybe when you
          come home.
          (handing her a binder)
           This is everything you need to know.

          84 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY

          John and Jenny lug their suitcases across the front lawn to
          the car, Marley running around them. Debby's glancing
          through the binder.

                         JENNY'S VOICE
          Debby. Welcome to our home! Marley is
          a spirited dog who loves interaction.
          We've never left him before but we're
          sure he'll behave just as he does when
          we're at home.
          They kiss him goodbye. Get in the cab and go. Debby runs to
          Marley, grabs his leash and struggles with all her might to
          hold on to Marley.

          with a child. She smiles. No tears.

                         JENNY'S VOICE
          There are just a few things about
          Marley you need to know. He eats three
          times a day. If he looks starved, feed
          him again. Of course all this food has
          to go somewhere.

          their car. Jenny leans out, laughing, and takes a picture.

                         JENNY'S VOICE
          Marley's ears get a lot of wax buildup.
          Once or twice while we're gone, please
          use cotton balls and the blue ear-
          cleaning stuff to clean them out. Wear

          Debby is throwing up in her mouth a little as she cleans
          Marley's ears. Marley loves it.

                         JENNY'S VOICE
          Marley is an excellent watchdog. And
          in this neighborhood, that's a good
          thing. You can rest easy at night,
          knowing he's on the job.

          John and Jenny stop at a bed-and-breakfast for the night.
          It's raining softly.

                         JENNY'S VOICE
          Thunderstorms are his weak point.
          Well, one of his weak points. You can
          give him sedatives if you think a storm
          is arriving. He doesn't like them, so
          push them down into his throat as far
          as they go.

          Debby is showering - and then starts SCREAMING. Marley has
          stuck his head through the shower curtain and is licking the
          water. Debby splashes water at him to make him go away.
          Marley, thinking she's playing, scrambles into the tub with
          her. She grabs the curtain, and it pops off the curtain
          rings one by one as in ",Psycho."

                         JOHN'S VOICE
          - actually, you might want to keep the
          bathroom door closed in general.

          Debby has run out of the bathroom, a towel hastily wrapped

          earth with the towel in his mouth. Debby SCREAMS.

          Debby is standing on a coffee table, nude, swatting at an

          Other than that, enjoy him! Thanks so

          HUGE framed picture of Pope John XXIII.

          MRS. BUTTERLY
          And if you need anything during the
          night, I'm right next door. The
          blankets are wool. Good heat in them.

          Oh, they're electric?

          MRS. BUTTERLY
          No, not in this house. My brother died
          in a fire, God rest him.

          In this room, actually. It's been re-
          papered. Good night. God bless.
          Jenny sits on the bed. The CREAKING is terrible.

                         JENNY
          Look, I know we haven't had sex
          since... you know. But there's no way
          we're breaking the streak tonight.

                         JOHN
          No kidding. 'Cause it's not just God
          watching. God, his mother...
          (indicating next door)
          .and apparently his best friend.

                         97

          97 INT. IRISH BEDROOM - LATER

          They are in separate beds, staring at the crucifix.

                         JOHN
          It's July, but I think I can see my
          breath.

                         JENNY
          I can't feel my toes.
          John gets out of his bed and into Jenny's. Much SQUEAKING.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          My God. Shhh.

                         JOHN
          It's not the mattress. It's the
          shrieks of over-sexed souls in hell.

                         JENNY
          You wanna join them?
          He looks at her.

                         JOHN
          Are you sure, because we don't have
          to...

                         JENNY
          I can't help myself. Knowing it hasn't
          happened in this house in 50 years is a
          turn-on.
          They roll into each others' arms, the bed squeaking.

          Maybe she's deaf...

          98 INT. IRISH B & B - DAY 98

          The next morning. John and Jenny, looking flushed and
          relaxed, and slightly abashed, come downstairs. Mrs.
          Butterly looks at them sourly. So do the other guests.

                         JENNY

                         (TO JOHN)
          They heard us.

                         JOHN
          No...
          He jumps as Mrs. Butterly slams the teapot on the table.

          MRS. BUTTERLY
          Tea?
          (looks him in the eye)
          I'm off to Mass.
          Mrs. Butterly leaves. John and Jenny look at the other
          guests. They smile bravely.

                         JOHN
          Wow. Any of you hear her bed squeaking
          last night? I hope she hits confession
          before Mass, that's all I can say.

          99 INT. ANOTHER B & B - DAY 99

          Another widow, another room, another collection of religious
          artifacts. John smiles.

          100 INT. A THIRD B & B - NIGHT 100

          Jenny sits on the bed, smiles at the NOISE, starts taking off
          her shoes. John ushers the Owner out of the room.

          101 EXT. CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 101

          John and Jenny pull into the driveway. They see Debby, the
          house sitter, on the front steps with her bag packed. She's
          tired-looking, beat. She reaches for a pair of crutches.
          John gets out of his car, a smile on his face.

                         JOHN
          Hey, Debby. So how was--
          -Debby hurls the binder of instructions at him.



                         

                         

                         

                         
            65.

                         101 CONTINUED:

                         DEBBY
          There were eleven thunderstorms while
          you were away. Eleven! And you were
          right. He doesn't like thunderstorms!

                         JENNY
          Okay, yeah, wow. Eleven, huh? That is
          a lot.

                         DEBBY
          And those goddamned dog tranquilizers
          don't work!

                         JOHN
          Did you give him four at a time?

                         DEBBY
          I mean on humans!
          She hobbles to the car, tries to get in with her crutches.
          They frustrate her and she ends up beating the ground with
          them until she throws them down. She's losing it.

                         DEBBY (CONT'D)
          (as she gets in the car)
          And just so you know, I am a dog
          person. But that's not a dog! That's
          evil with a dog face! That's also
          humping your leg! Lose my number!!
          And she gets into her car and guns it, splintering the
          crutches as she peels out. John and Jenny, watch her go,
          turn and look at the front door. Marley's face in the little
          square window at the top, peeking out at them.

          102 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 102

          A THUNDERSTORM outside. John sits at his desk, tries to work
          while Marley walks in circles. John looks at him...

                         JOHN
          It's only thunder...
          John goes back to work. We hear more THUNDER, and Marley
          starts howling, knocks over a floor lamp... John looks off
          towards the bedroom...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Jenny?! Can you help me out here? I
          got twenty minutes to file this column!
          We follow John as he gets up from his desk, heads towards the
          back bedroom...

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
          Jenny?
          We follow him into the room, an anxious Marley close at his
          heels. She's not here, he turns around just as she steps out
          of the bathroom, smiling...

                         JENNY
          Luck of the Irish...
          She holds up a pregnancy test with a clear BLUE line, her
          exuberant face lit up by a FLASH OF LIGHTNING. John goes to
          hug her, as Marley HOWLS in the b.g., we then...

          FADE OUT.
          SUPER: "Nine Months Later."

          103 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT 103

          John and Jenny are asleep. Marley goes through his nighttime

                         ROUTINE:
          He chews through a sock. He drinks out of the toilet. He
          works on chewing through the plastic dog food tub. Another
          night and he'll be in. He chases a fly.
          Finally he goes to his bed on the floor of the bedroom. He
          settles himself down to sleep. He yawns, he scratches, he
          closes his eyes. He snores. And then -
          He wakes up, suddenly alert. He looks over at Jenny. He
          gets up, sits by her side of the bed, and waits.
          Suddenly Jenny sits up, rests a hand on her stomach.

                         JENNY

                         WHOA--
          She catches her breath, leans over to John.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          John. John, wake up.

                         JOHN
          What?

                         JENNY
          I think it's time.

                         104

          104 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Jenny has finished dressing. Suddenly she yelps in pain,
          doubles over. John takes her in his arms.

                         JOHN
          It's okay.

                         JENNY
          Ow!
          Suddenly, A GROWL. They turn to see Marley glaring at John.

                         JOHN
          It's okay. I'm not hurting her.
          Jenny MOANS again and now Marley's eyes narrow. He takes a
          step towards John.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Please don't scream, honey. He'll kill
          me.

                         JENNY
          You put the car seat in this weekend,
          right? They won't let us take the baby
          home without the car seat installed.

                         JOHN
          Like I'd forget that.

          105 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 105

          Panicking, John is struggling to get the car seat he forgot
          out of the box. He starts beating at the Styrofoam. Marley
          barks excitedly. John gets an idea, hands him one end of the
          box.

                         JOHN
          Come on, Marley. Help me out here. Do
          what you do best...
          Unsure, Marley licks the box.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          No, don't lick it, eat it! Destroy it!
          You can chew through drywall, man! I
          know you can do this!
          Marley catches on. He starts shredding the box.

                         

                         

                         

                         
             68.

          106 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 106

          John hurls a suitcase and the partially-assembled, partially-
          destroyed car seat into the back seat. He yells:

                         JOHN
          Car seat's in!

          107 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - NIGHT 107

          Jenny is tottering down the walk as John pulls out of the
          garage, gets her into the passenger seat.

          108 INT. CAR - NIGHT (STATIONARY) 108


                         JOHN
          Ready?

                         JENNY
          Yeah. You?
          Marley barks from the back seat. They both turn and look at
          him. What's he doing here?

          109 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - NIGHT 109

          John opens the front door, drags Marley in. John gives him a

          GIANT BONE-SHAPED CHEW TOY...

                         JOHN
          Okay. Here... Stay. Be good. Please,
          God. No storms. Stay.

          110 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - MORNING 110

          The chew toy now almost completely gone. Marley sleeps
          beside it as we hear A KEY IN THE LOCK and he gets to his
          feet, greets John as he comes through the door.

                         JOHN
          Hey, boy.

          111 EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING 111

          As John let's Marley out.

          112 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 112

          As John sets down a bowl of food, crouches down as Marley
          starts to eat.

                         JOHN
          Here's the thing: in a couple of hours,
          we're gonna bring the baby home. And
          you'd be doing me a really big favor if
          you didn't freak out.
          (stands, sighs)
          I'm gonna try and do the same thing.

                         113 OMITTED 113-

          As the sun now streams in through the front windows down onto 
          Marley, who is sound asleep. We hear A CAR DOOR CLOSE and he
          raises his head...
          A moment later, THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and John comes in and
          Marley greets him, jumps up on his chest.

                         JOHN
          Hey, boy... let's go outside...

          115 EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING 115

          As Marley relieves himself, John yawning in the b.g.

          116 INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 116

          As Jenny unpacks her suitcase. Marley bounds into the room
          and greets her.

                         JENNY
          Hello, Marley...
          She crouches down, gives him a kiss, rubs his back. And
          that's when we hear a small, birdlike chirp and the dog
          freezes. Where'd that come from?
          We hear the coo again and this time Marley lifts one paw in
          the air like a bird dog, and points in the direction of the
          car seat that we now see sitting on the bed...

                         JOHN
          You know what I think would be a
          bummer? If he ate the baby...

                         116 CONTINUED:
          She moves to the car seat and turns it around so that now we
          see the baby for the first time. She smiles at Marley...

                         JENNY
          This is Patrick, Marley.
          Jenny unbuckles Patrick from the car seat and crouches down
          beside Marley and lets the dog sniff the baby's toes, then up
          his legs, finally his diaper which puts Marley into a Pampers
          stupor, the Holy Grail of aromas and Marley's eyes glaze...

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          See, he's not gonna hurt him.

                         JOHN
          No, but I'm gonna have to put a lock on
          the diaper pail.

          117 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 117

          Garbage day, and the trash piled outside the Grogan house
          testifies to the change inside. Empty cartons of diapers,
          the packaging from a crib, a stroller, the car seats, the
          Pack'n'Play...

          118 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 118

          Jenny tries to watch the baby, now crawling around on the
          floor and file her column over the phone at the same time.

                         JENNY
          I have the quote right here--
          Patrick crawls over Marley, who's supremely patient as
          Patrick takes a fistful of his eye.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          Well, have legal call them again and
          get a release for it. They told me it
          was on the record-- Marley-- Patrick,
          that's his eye-- No, not you, Karla,
          just get the release. I'll call you
          back.

                         (HANGS UP)
          Be gentle, Patrick!
          Jenny leans back in her chair, rubs her face. Then...

          Expect in the First Year." He takes a breath, looks up,
          watches a COUPLE make out on a blanket.

                         120

          120 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          The baby in his high chair. Jenny sets a few cheerios on the
          tray. Patrick picks them up and drops them, we follow them
          down...

                         THE FLOOR
          To where Marley waits, eagerly vacuuming up the cereal. It
          continues to RAIN CHEERIOS and we then BOOM BACK UP and see
          that Patrick is now eight months old, laughing as he throws
          the cereal onto the floor...

          121 EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT 121

          John stands there letting Marley out. He looks back at the
          house, watches Jenny through the window as she sets Patrick
          down in his crib, shuts the light out.

          122 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT 122

          They're both working at their desks. Jenny looks up from her
          computer.

                         JENNY
          I need to go in tomorrow for a few
          hours, see my editor. Think you can
          watch the baby for me?

                         JOHN
          Sure.
          John looks around the room. The place is a disaster area.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Remember us?

                         JENNY
          You mean, those younger, skinnier
          better looking people? Yeah, I think I
          remember them. Vaguely.

                         JOHN
          Well, I miss them.
          He turns back to his work. She looks at him, sets her pad
          aside, comes up behind him, puts her arms around him.



                         

                         

                         

                         
             72.

                         122 CONTINUED: 122

                         JENNY
          They're still here.
          He looks up at their reflection in the window, not so sure.

          123 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 123

          John and Jenny now asleep on opposite sides of the bed. On
          the floor beside John, Marley lifts his head and GROWLS. We
          then hear a piercing SCREAM coming from outside. The dog is
          already out of the room.
          John sits up, immediately starts to get out of bed...

                         JOHN

                         MARLEY-

                         JENNY
          Honey, don't go out there.

                         JOHN
          Stay here. Call the police.

          124 INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 124

          Marley's at the door growling as John, in his boxer shorts,
          grabs the dog by the choke chain and opens the door. We hear
          another SCREAM coming from a couple houses down and Marley
          breaks through the screen, pulling John with him...

          125 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - SPA 125

          As other lights come on, NEIGHBORS start to come out onto the
          street. John runs to where we see THE TEENAGE GIRL NEXT DOOR
          bent over, sobbing, in her driveway beside her car, driver's
          door still open. John lets go of Marley and hurries to her.

                         GIRL
          He said not to scream or he'd stab me,
          but I screamed...
          And John sees the blood on her shirt. He takes hold of her.

                         JOHN
          Okay okay okay, I've got you...

                         (THEN)
          Where's your mom?

                         GIRL
          At work...

                         JOHN
          Jenny'll call her...



                         

                         

                         

                         
            73.

                         125

                         125 CONTINUED:
          Marley sniffs at the ground, growling more and more
          intensely. We hear SHOUTING, "He went that way" as several
          neighbors take off running. Marley lifts his head and he,
          too, bolts into the night---

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Marley! NO!
          But he's gone and John has to stay with the girl. We hear
          SIRENS as she slides down the car and sits down on the
          ground. John sits down beside her, holding onto her...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          All this time we've been living here, I
          never got your name.

                         GIRL
          Lisa.

                         JOHN
          Well, you're gonna be alright, Lisa,
          the police are on the way...
          John looks off, wondering where Marley is...

          126 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - LATER 126

          A crime scene. Jenny, clutching the baby, stands on the porch
          watching as an AMBULANCE pulls away. John, now in shorts and
          a T-shirt, comes jogging up the walk.

                         JOHN
          I can't find him anywhere.

                         JENNY
          Maybe we should get in the car, drive
          around.

                         JOHN
          I'll get the keys...
          John's coming into the house when a police cruiser pulls to
          the curb in front of the house. A POLICEMAN gets out of the
          driver's side, then opens the back and leads Marley out. He
          bounds up the walk to the two of them who greet him...

                         JENNY
          Marley!

                         JOHN
          Where were you?

                         126 CONTINUED: 126

                         OFFICER
          We found him outside the 76 station on
          Radford. He had the guy cornered in the
          men's room.

                         JENNY
          So you caught the guy?

                         OFFICER

                         NO--

                         (INDICATES MARLEY)
          jig caught the guy. He also gnawed the
          barrel of my shotgun, and ate half my
          radio mic.
          They look at Marley wagging his tail, panting.

                         OFFICER (CONT'D)
          Anyway, the neighbors all said he
          belonged here, but none of them wanted
          to drive him, so...

                         JOHN
          Thanks for bringing him home.

                         OFFICER
          Helluva dog.
          John nods as The Officer heads back to his car. Jenny
          crouches down and gives Marley a big hug and a back rub...

                         JENNY
          My hero.

          127 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY 127

          An upscale, newer money neighborhood. An OPEN HOUSE sign out
          front. John pulls up. He opens the door, holds up a hand to
          Marley who sits in the back--

                         JOHN
          Stay.
          --and starts to unhook Patrick from his car seat. Marley
          bolts out of the car and heads straight for the house...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Marley!

                         

                         

                         

                         
             75.

          128 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY 128

          A REALTOR is showing a COUPLE around the large, empty, new
          house. She points out the designer kitchen that looks out
          onto the patio and pool, a huge yellow lab now leaping in.
          A moment later, we see John, clutching Patrick, enter the
          backyard, try to haul Marley out of the pool. He gives up,
          heads for the house, opens the back door and peers inside.

                         JOHN
          Hi.
          The Realtor smiles awkwardly at him.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Can I see a set-up, please?

                         REALTOR
          Certainly.
          (looks at the baby)
          First home?

                         JOHN
          No, we live up in West Palm, over on
          Churchill?

                         REALTOR
          Ooooh. Well, I think you'd find this
          neighborhood to be quite a pleasant
          change.
          And now Marley bolts past him into the house, tracking wet
          footprints all over the floor, jumps up onto the REALTOR.

                         REALTOR (CONT'D)
          Oh... my... hello...

                         JOHN
          Hey, who's dog is that?

          129 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 129

          John enters, carrying Patrick, supplies to fix the screen.

                         JOHN
          Jenny?
          A wet Marley bounds into the house, heads for the back. John
          follows.

          Jenny is crouched on the floor when John appears in
          doorway.

                         JOHN
          Hey. You alright?
          She stands up, smiles the best she can.

                         JENNY
          I'm fine. Where you guys been?

                         JOHN
          I wanna show you something.

                         JENNY
          What?

                         JOHN
          (hands her the set up)
          A house.
          (before she can react)
          It's a little pricey, but I think we
          can do it.

                         JENNY
          John, I know we've talked about it, but
          I'm not sure this is the right time.

                         JOHN
          And when would the right time be, Jen?
          After one of us gets stabbed in the
          driveway?

                         JENNY

                         JOHN--

                         JOHN
          C'mon, honey, we're cramped in here.
          This was supposed to be our three-year
          house, remember?

                         JENNY
          I know, but we can't afford to buy a
          new one.

                         JOHN
          Sure, we can. With both our salaries--

                         JENNY
          Yeah, about that... I don't think I'm
          gonna be able to keep working.

          I'm pregnant.

                         JOHN
          What? Are you sure?
          She steps away, revealing the counter where FOUR PREGNANCY
          TESTS are lined up, all with the same result: Positive.

                         JENNY
          Very.

          131 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY 131

          John sits with Sebastian at his desk.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Already? I mean, how old's the one you
          got?

                         JOHN
          About eight months.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Jesus. Haven't you heard of birth
          control?

                         JOHN
          Yeah, well, sometimes it doesn't work.
          You know what else doesn't work? The
          one about how "A dog will stop your
          wife's biological clock."

                         SEBASTIAN
          Hey, I'm not the one, keeps getting her
          pregnant.
          John gives him a look, sees Arnie heading into his office,
          takes a breath and gets to his feet.

                         JOHN
          Wish me luck.

                         SEBASTIAN
          I'm sure he'll give you the raise.

                         JOHN
          How do you know?

                         SEBASTIAN
          He always gives me one.
          John just shakes his head, starts for Arnie's office.

          Why should I do this, why are you worth
          it?

                         JOHN
          Because I'm doing a good job?

          Are you asking me?

                         JOHN
          Well, since I took over, the column has
          doubled in readership...

                         ARNIE
          So you are doing a good job.

                         JOHN
          Yes, sir.

                         ARNIE
          So why not make it permanent?

                         JOHN
          You mean, like forever?

                         ARNIE
          That's what the word "forever" means.
          Yes.

                         (THEN)
          John, you know how many yo yo's in the
          other room would kill to have their own
          column? You took a piece of crap About
          Towner and turned it into something
          fresh.

                         (SITS BACK)
          I hate to break it to you, son, but
          you're a good columnist.

                         JOHN
          I just had this idea about myself, you
          know, that I was a reporter.

                         ARNIE
          Yeah, well sometimes life comes up with
          a better idea. Tell you what. You
          make it a daily column and I'll double
          your salary. How's that?

          A MOVING VAN is parked out front. Marley runs back and forth
          as the MOVERS load up the truck, John and and a very pregnant
          Jenny supervising. John sees LISA, the girl next door, as she
          comes out of her house. She walks over to him.

                         JOHN
          Hey, Lisa.

                         LISA
          Hi.

                         (THEN)
          You're leaving.

                         JOHN
          Yeah.

                         LISA
          well, I don't blame you. I just
          thought I'd come over and say--
          But Marley comes running over and she crouches down to greet
          him. She hugs him a while...

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna miss you.
          John watches as she holds on to him a bit longer, thanking
          him as well. John turns away, starts back for the van to
          give her a moment. She stands up.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          Where you moving to?

                         JOHN
          Boca.

                         LISA
          Huh.

                         JOHN
          Huh... what?

                         LISA
          Nothing. I just... never pictured, you
          know, a guy like you moving to Boca.

                         JOHN
          A guy like me?

                         LISA
          Yeah, you know, young, cool, whatever.



                         

                         

                         

                         
             80.

                         133 CONTINUED: 133

                         JOHN
          So you think I'm young and cool. And
          you're not just saying that because I
          saved your life?

                         LISA
          Actually, a paramedic named Josh saved
          my life.

                         JOHN
          Right. Well, take care, Lisa. Oh,

                         WAIT--
          He reaches into a moving box, pulls out a chewed-up black
          Converse.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          I believe this belongs to you.

                         LISA
          Thanks. I'll have to chew up the other
          one to make it match.
          (extends her hand)
          Have fun down there.

                         JOHN
          Yeah. It's gonna be great.

          134 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - NIGHT 134

           Still beautiful, but now we hear the sound of a BABY WAILING

          OVER...

          135 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - NIGHT 135

           This is the elegant kitchen we saw, bare and uninhabited,
           several scenes ago. Now it's full of the clutter of the
           Grogans' life. The new baby, CONOR is screaming. We follow
          Jenny through the new house asshetries to soothe him.

                         JENNY
          Shhh, honey. Come on.
          John follows now...

                         JOHN
          Is he wet?

                         JENNY
          No. And I can't get a burp out of him.
          I think it's colic.



                         

                         

                         

                         
             81.

                         135 CONTINUED: 135

                         JOHN
          Want me to drive him?

                         JENNY
          We can't do that every night.
          From the other room, we HEAR Patrick CRYING, "Mommy!"

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          Oh, Jesus.

                         JOHN
          I'll do the washer.

          136 INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT 136

          John sitting on the washer with his WAILING BABY. Not fun.
          John looks to where Marley lies in the corner, watching.

                         JOHN
          Any ideas?

          137 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 137

          John is opening the cupboards, getting cereal and yogurt into
          a bowl for Patrick. Jenny enters with a fussing Conor on her
          shoulder...

                         JENNY
          Can you take him? I just need a minute
          to myself.
          John takes the baby and instantly Conor starts crying louder.

                         JOHN
          Happens every time.

                         JENNY
          You just need to spend more time with
          him.

          138 INT. CONOR'S BEDROOM - DAY 138

          John puts Conor on the changing table, unbuttons his onesie,
          checks his diaper. It's wet; he starts changing him. Conor
          cries throughout. Jenny enters.

                         JENNY
          It's okay, I'll do it.



                         

                         

                         

                         
            82.

                         138

                         138 CONTINUED:

                         JOHN
          I'm doing it! It's fine! You tell me
          to spend more time with him, I do it,
          and then you take over because I'm not
          doing it right.

                         JENNY
          I don't want you changing him when
          you're mad.

                         JOHN
          I'm not mad!
          He hears himself, lets her change the baby. She takes him,
          sits down with him in a rocking chair, tries to nurse him...

                         JENNY
          Conor, come on... Conor, please...
          She finally stops trying, rocks the chair, looks helplessly
          at John.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          I don't know what's wrong with me.
          Mothers are supposed to be able to give
          their baby everything.

                         JOHN
          He's just colicky, Jen. He'll grow out
          of it.

                         JENNY
          Okay, here's an idea, you stay here and
          I'll go to work while he grows out of
          it.
          He holds up his hands, what does he say to that. She looks
          up at him a moment.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          I'm just tired, alright? Go on.
          She then resumes trying to nurse the baby. He walks out of
          the room. She rocks back and forth, looks up with a dark
          expression as she hears his CAR START.

          ARNIE (V.0.)
          It's post partum depression...

                         

                         

                         

                         
             83.

          139 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY 139

          John sits on a stool in front of'a portable SCREEN while a
          pretty female PHOTOGRAPHER adjusts her lights. Arnie sits
          nearby on a desk watching the portrait...

                         ARNIE
          Her hormones are all on tilt and she's
          depressed. It happens. After my
          fourth kid was born, I'd wake up, find
          my wife just staring at me with a
          mallet in her hand. I thought she was
          gonna kill me in my sleep. I still
          do...

                         (THEN)
          Did you get her the gift?

                         JOHN
          Yeah.

                         ARNIE
          Huh. That usually works.
          Arnie gets off the desk, says to the Photographer:

                         ARNIE (CONT'D)
          Alright, Janice, make him look pretty.
          The man's an official columnist now.
          Arnie moves off and the photographer looks up from her camera
          and smiles at John. He smiles back. She keeps smiling... so
          does he... she finally indicates his hair...

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
          You have a Barney sticker in your--

                         JOHN
          Oh-- thanks.
          He rakes his fingers through his hair, grabs the offending
          sticker, looks at her...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          I must look like hell... I don't think
          I've had a full night sleep in two
          months.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
          Stress?



                         

                         

                         

                         
             84.

                         139 CONTINUED: 139

                         JOHN
          Kids. I got one with colic, and
          another, can't make it through the
          night without coming into my room every
          two hours.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
          Well, I think you're holding up great.
          You look cute.

                         JOHN
          Really?

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
          Yeah, like a cute, exhausted Dad. It's
          adorable.
          John just nods stupidly, the dagger so deep in his heart,
          he'll never reach it. She smiles at him.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
          You certainly look a lot better than
          Jerry ever looked. I tried to get him
          to take a new picture, but he liked the
          one they took the day he started the
          column, nineteen years ago.

                         JOHN
          Nineteen years, huh...
          And just when he thought one dagger was brutal enough, his
          expression goes really pensive. And on that look, we see a
          FLASH as she takes his picture and go right to:

          140 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - NIGHT 140

          John pulls into his driveway, turns off the car and just sits
          there.

          141 INT. JOHN'S CAR - SAME 141

          As John looks at the house... the windows all lit up. Inside
          Jenny moves about with the baby over her shoulder as Patrick
          chases Marley around the room. John sits in the car, unable
          to move, just watching the chaos in the window.
          Marley jumps up against the glass, stands on his hind legs,
          paws to the window and looks out. He barks and now Jenny
          comes up behind him, hauls him off the window and now sees
          John sitting in the car. She gives him a look that says
          "What're you doing? Get in here!"
          John quickly gets out of the car...

                         

                         

                         

                         
             85.

          142 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 142

          John and Jenny eat dinner in exhausted silence. Patrick
          throws his food on the floor where a happy Marley waits.
          Conor starts crying O.S. and Jenny gets up like a robot.

                         JOHN
          I'll get him.
          John leaves the room. Jenny sits there.

          143 INT. JOHN & JENNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 143

          John and Jenny are in bed asleep. Patrick comes into their
          room.

                         PATRICK
          Mommy?
          Jenny wakes up on autopilot.

                         JENNY
          Okay, honey, let's go back to bed.
          She leads him out of the room. And a second later Conor
          starts crying. John lies there a moment, then gets up.

          144 INT. CONOR'S ROOM - NIGHT 144

          Through the doorway, Jenny, her back to us, gently bounces
          Conor on her shoulder. John moves into FRAME...

                         JOHN
          Jen, you okay?

          REVERSE - ON JENNY
          She's crying, her back to John who's now in the b.g. A
          moment, then...

                         JENNY
          I'm fine.

          145 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 145

          John comes into the kitchen just as Jenny takes a chewed copy
          of "Good-night, Moon" from Marley's mouth...

                         JENNY
          You ruined it! Bad dog!
          She leaves the room and John looks at the dog.



                         

                         

                         

                         
            86.

                         145

                         145 CONTINUED:

                         JOHN
          You just had to eat the book? What,
          have you got some kind of death wish?
          I'm telling you, you better chill, or
          she'll kill you. Right after she kills
          me.

                         146

          146 EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

          As Jenny loads up the back of the car with bags of groceries.
          Patrick, sitting in the cart, looks off and points--

                         PATRICK
          Look!
          Jenny turns and sees A BUS, with John's picture on the side,
          an advertisement for his column. She watches it pass.

                         PATRICK (CONT'D)
          Daddy!

                         JENNY
          Uh-huh. I see him.
          And she goes back to loading the car.

                         147

          147 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - CONOR'S ROOM - DAY

           As Jenny gently sets a sleeping Conor in his crib. She
          quietly backs out of the room and shuts the door.

          148 INT. HALLWAY - SAME 148

          As she peers in on Patrick, also napping in his room.

          149 INT. JOHN & JENNY'S BEDROOM - DAY 149

          As Jenny comes in, Marley following and sits down heavily on
          the bed. She looks at Marley as he lays down beside the bed.

                         JENNY
          Stay.
          She now lays down and closes her eyes. A moment of peace.
          And then, somewhere in the distance we hear a faint BEEP BEEP
          BEEP as some truck backs up. Marley lifts his head, perks up
          his ears and listens. Please don't bark, dog. Please don't
          bark. BEEP BEEP- And Marley BARKS, bolts out of the room...
          Jenny opens her eyes with a start as Marley runs barking
          through the house, we hear something CRASH and break O.S.



                         

                         

                         

                         
             87.

                          149

                         149 CONTINUED:
           And now Conor's crying.

                          150

          150 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          As Marley jumps up against the window and peers out. Jenny
          comes into the room, sees a lamp on its side, a cushion torn
          open where Marley now stands. she grabs him by the collar--

                         JENNY
          Why do you do this?! Why do you wreck
          everything! Why?!!
          She hauls her hand back to hit him, but hesitates, and just
          shoves him away from her and storms into the other room for
          Conor.

                         151

          151 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - EVENING

          As John pulls up, gets out of his car. We hear Marley
          barking in the garage.

                         152

          152 INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

          As John comes in, sees Jenny sitting there on the couch.

                         JOHN
          Why's Marley out in the--

                         JENNY
          I want that dog out of here.

                         JOHN
          Okay. I'll take him out.
          She looks up at him.

                         JENNY
          I want you to get him out of here and
          keep him out of here.

                         JOHN
          What'd he do--

                         JENNY
          I mean it, John. I want him gone. I
          want him gone for good.

          John watches the guy walk off, scribbles a new
          it up. This one reads "E F D TO GOOD HOME."
          comes up to John.

                         SEBASTIAN
          You giving up the dog? i thought yo u
          loved that thing.

                         JOHN
          Jenny wants him out.

                         SEBASTIAN
          That's harsh, man.

                         JOHN
          I don't know what else to do. She's
          really unhappy. Maybe the dog is just
          one too many things.

                         SEBASTIAN
          They're all unhappy. Trust me.
          Well... who knows? Maybe you'll get
          lucky and nobody'll want him.
          John just nods, thinks about that. Sebastian glances around,
          then takes John aside.

                         SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Listen, there's something I gotta tell
          you.

                         (THEN)
          I'm leaving the paper.

          What?

                         SEBASTIAN
          I just gave Arnie my notice.
          John looks over at Arnie's office, the door's closed.

                         SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          He's not too happy about it. He called
          me an ungrateful quizzling and threw a
          stapler at me.

                         JOHN

          I know who you're talking about.

                         SEBASTIAN
          You don't seem happy for me.

                         JOHN
          I am. I'm just in shock. I mean, I'm
          in Florida because of you. Woodward
          and Bernstein. Remember? That was the
          idea.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Yeah, that was the idea before you
          decided to be the Andy Rooney of South
          Florida.

                         JOHN
          I didn't decide to be anything--

                         SEBASTIAN
          Exactly.
          Boom. That hurts John. They stand there a moment,
          considering each other, then.

                         SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Look, man, you're happy doing your
          thing and I'm not trying to piss on
          that. I mean it, you're good at it. I
          just wanted you to be the first to

          John is working at his desk when Arnie drops a few stacks of
          letters down.

                         ARNIE
          These are all responses to the column
          you wrote last week.
          John thinks a moment...

                         ARNIE (CONT'D)
          One where you said you may have to give
          the dog away.

                         JOHN
          (looks at the letters)
          Oh. I assume they all want me to keep
          him.

                         ARNIE
          No. They're all saying they'd take
          him.
          Arnie moves on and John stares at the letters.

          John walks around the yard picking up Marley's various toys,
          putting them into a box.

           Marley follows, jumping up, trying to get the toys back out
           of the box. John grabs a frisbee, looks at the dog.

                          JOHN 
           You can't lo any more of these, ok ay?
           Because they s e 're not gonna keep getting
           you more, and I won't be there to look
           for them...
          He looks at Marley standing there wagging his tail.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          You're gonna be fine, alright. I'll
          just be different. Maybe e
          it'll, b better, nobody poking your

          Jenny's been watching. She stands there thoughtfully as John
          puts the frisbee in the box and resumes the hunt for the rest
          of Marley's stuff, the dog following him.

          160 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 60

          Jenny's sitting on the bed waiting as John comes in.

                         JOHN
          He's all packed up. Patrick will want
          to say good-bye, but Conor's too young

          I know, but you can't do it. I won't
          let you. You can't give away Marley.

                         JOHN
          Okay, wait. I'm lost. You told me you
          didn't want him around. What's
          happened?

                         JENNY
          The fact that you would have done
          something like that, for me, that you

          one tells you how hard it's gonna

          Which part?

                         JENNY
          All of it. Marriage. Being a parent.
          It's the hardest thing in the world and
          no one prepares you for that. No one
          tells you how much you have to give up.

                         (THEN)
          me.
          I gave up so much of what makes me
          But I'm not allowed to say that.
          People think you're a bad person if you
          say that. But it's how I feel
          sometimes, and I need you to know that.

          It's not your fault. It's just
          something I have to figure out. But
          Marley going, that won't fix anything.

                         JOHN

          John and Jenny and Marley and the two boys stroll. Feels
          good to be out as a family again. Marley wants to greet all
          the Boca mini-dogs as they are being walked or carried by
          their owners. Jenny leans up against John.

                         JOHN
          I made reservations at Sunny's.
          Thought we could all sit outside.

          Thank you.

          162 EXT. SIDEWALK CAPE - DAY 162

          They are seated at an outside table, shaded by a large round
          umbrella. John hooks Marley's leash to two of the table legs
          as a waiter brings drinks. Jenny holds up her beer.

                         JENNY
          To a perfect day with my boys.

                         BEHIND THEM
          A blonde Boca Trophy wife, with a poodle on a jeweled leash,
          shrieks excitedly as she meets up with another woman, same
          type, with another small fluffy'dog. The little dogs yip.
          CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to underneath the table to Marley who has
          spotted the poodles and is now locked and loaded.

          ON JOHN AND JENNY
          As suddenly their table suddenly leaps away from them and
          starts moving down the sidewalk, crashing into other tables,
          banging-into waiters with trays, making a terrible NOISE as
          it scrapes over the faux Italian paving stones.
          The four Grogans sit facing each other across, their drinks
          suddenly in their laps.
          Marley is pulling the table, like a dog with a sled, towards
          the now-terrified small dogs. He is chugging forward with
          every ounce of rippling muscle he has.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          Marley!
          John hurries after the dog; Jenny stays with the boys.

          As Marley-with-table approaches the small dogs, they break
          free of their leashes and run. Several innocent bystanders
          are knocked off their feet.
          There's a florist kiosk in the center of the plaza; Marley-
          and-table take out most of the merchandise.
          Security guards look around wildly. It's pandemonium, but
          Marley is in heaven. He makes a circuit of the entire plaz a,
          one poor poodle runs for her life.
          Finally, back where Marley started, the terrified toy poodle
          leaps into Jenny's arms. Marley tries to brake -

                         JOHN
          Marley, no!
          - and suddenly, he is jerked back. John has tackled the
          table Marley's dragging. Marley YELPS and lands on his bac k,
          then quickly rights himself, tail wagging, the happiest dog
          in the world.
          Everyone surrounding them on the plaza has frozen silent.
          They all stare at Marley and the Grogans. The poodle jumps
          out of her arms and runs to its distraught owner. Jenny's
          head is in her hands, her shoulders heaving...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Jen, you okay?

                         (NO ANSWER)
          Jenny?
          And she slowly looks up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, her whole
          body racking, tears in her eyes. Her LAUGHTER BECOMES--

          Sphynx, the baby, colleen in a portable bassinet beside him.

          Who was on the phone?

                         JOHN
          Philadelphia Inquirer.
          She looks at him.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          They're offering me a job.

                         (THEN)
          As a reporter. I guess the editor was
          down here on vacation, read my stuff.

                         JENNY
          What'd you say?

                         JOHN
          I said thank you very much, but I'm
          happy where I am. I mean, it's a big
          change, Florida to Pennsylvania.

                         JENNY
          Yes, it is.

                         JOHN
          Anyway.
          John smiles at her, then goes to his sons...

          She watches as he kneels down beside the boys, resumes
          digging alongside them.

          What's wrong?

                         JOHN
          I don't know. Maybe it's turning 40
          next week, or maybe...

          Maybe what?

          reading "HAPPY 40TH."
          Jenny is standing there, holding Colleen. Conor, aged 5 and

          Jenny squats down with the cake, and John and his kids start
          to blow out the candles.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           One, two -
           And then Marley jumps the gun, takes a huge bite of the cake,

          The guests have gone. John sits in a lounge chair, holding
          out a fork so that Marley can lick the cake off of it. Most
          of the floating lights have gone out. Jenny comes out.

                         JENNY
          Okay, tell the truth, were you really
          surprised?

          Yeah. Thanks, Jen.
          She sits down on his lap...

          I called the editor last week. They'd
          still like to meet you.

                         JOHN
          Jenny, I couldn't do that, uproot us.
          We've got our friends, the schools...

                         JENNY
          First of all, you don't even have the
          job yet, it's just an interview.
          Second of all, you don't have that many
          friends.

                         JOHN
          Thank you. What I was trying to say,
          is that our life is here.

                         JENNY
          Baby, I got news for you, our life is
          wherever we are. And you're not happy
          here anymore, doing that column.
          You're restless, John. I feel it. I
          feel it when you read Sebastian's
          articles every day. And I feel it when
          you sit out in the driveway an extra
          five minutes before you come in.

                         (THEN)
          Maybe it's time for a change.

                         JOHN
          I'm forty, Jen. Seems kinda late for
          that.

                         JENNY
          Not so late.
          She stands up in the dark, lifts her dress over her head.

                         JOHN
          What're you doing?

                         JENNY
          We're not old, John. We can still
          surprise ourselves.
          He sits there stunned as she now dives into the pool. She
          surfaces and smiles at him.

          We're not old.
          And then we hear ANOTHER splash.

                         JOHN
          Uh-oh...
          And a moment later Marley's head goes bobbing by.

          John smiles to himself, walks over.

                         ARNIE (CONT'D)
          I just wanted to say good luck up
          there.

          Thank you, sir.

                         ARNIE
          Also, there's a good chance that every
          piece of advice I ever gave you, may in
          fact be total crap.

                         JOHN
          I appreciate it just the same.
          They stand there a moment, awkward. Then...

                         ARNIE
          This would be where a mushier guy would
          tell you he's proud of you, give you a
          hug, and send you on your way.

                         JOHN
          Really glad you're not that guy, sir.
          Arnie nods, goes back into his office and shuts the door.

          Look. There's Marley!
          THROUGH THE WINDOW they can see Marley's crate arriving at
          the plane on a luggage truck. Marley is asleep, heavily
          drugged. Conor starts banging on the window.

                         CONOR
          Hey, Marley! We're up here!

                         PATRICK

          going.

                         JOHN
          (aside to Jenny)
          Not to mention the tranquilizers. I
          think he's already reached his cruising
          altitude.

          The engines ROAR up and the stewardess begins her pre-flight
          safety demonstration. John watches her, smiling, relieved
          they made it this far, when he freezes.
          A MUFFLED MOAN is coming from beneath his feet. Clearly it's
          Marley. Passengers near them frown.

                         PASSENGER
          is that a dog?

                         JOHN
          Maybe, I don't know.

                         PATRICK
          Marley's Sad. Marley's our dog. He's
          with the suitcases.
          John smiles weakly at the Passenger.

                         JOHN
          What an imagination, huh?

                         (MOUTHING IT:)
          We don't have a dog.
          He makes the crazy sign with his finger, gesturing at
          Patrick. The MOANING gets worse. John just smiles tightly.

          Fall foliage. Beautiful, picture-perfect countryside. The
          Grogan family car winds along the roads. Marley has his head
          out the window, tongue wagging...

          177 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY 177

          A two-story country house, no neighbors visible. Trees,
          land, woodpile, the whole country living thing. The Grogans
          pile out of the car, look at the house. Marley takes off
          running...

                         JOHN
          Marley!
          Marley jumps into a pile of leaves, scatters them everywhere,
          rolls over onto his back and knocks over a rake, which falls
          and breaks a basement window.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          And... we're home.

          As John is introduced to fellow staff and reporters, most of
          them at least ten years younger than he is. He's shown his
          desk. John sits down at his cubicle, stares out the window
          at the city. His EDITOR, black, John's age, approaches with
          a much younger REPORTER...

                         EDITOR
          Hey, John. Settling in okay?

                         JOHN
          I'm fine, thanks.

                         EDITOR
          Good. I want you to meet Billy...
          He indicates the twenty-something guy beside him. John and
          Billy shake hands.

                         EDITOR (CONT'D)
          Billy's gonna show you the ropes.

          Well, some of them were, but--

          179 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

          January. John wakes up. Marley is whimpering at him.

                         JOHN
          What?
          And then Conor and Patrick burst into the room.

                         PATRICK
           It's here!

                          180

          180 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

          White everywhere. The family and Marley trudge into the
          snow, unused to their boots and snowsuits. Marley jumps
          around, barks like he's a puppy again.

                         181

          181 EXT. HILL - DAY

          The kids slide down the hill in a toboggan. John is at the
          bottom to catch them. Up at the house, Jenny calls...

                         JENNY
          Okay, time for lunch!

                         JOHN
          I'll bring this in. Go on up.
          The kids and Marley head up to the house. John drags the
          toboggan up the hill. He pauses at the top and looks down at
          the toboggan run. He gets on the toboggan.

                         JENNY
          Honey, what're you doing?

                         JOHN
          I can't remember the last time I rode
          on a toboggan..

                         JENNY
          Exactly.
          He starts sliding down the hill. Marley runs for him as he
          builds up speed...

                         JOHN
          Marley, no!



                         

                         

                         

                         
             104.

                         181 CONTINUED: 181
          But Marley jumps onto John's lap as they get going...

          ON THE TOBOGGAN
          Flying down the hill. Marley is much heavier than the kids,
          and they sail past the place where the kids stopped, through
          the woods, barely missing trees and low-hanging branches,

                         TOWARDS:

                         JENNY
          John! The creek!
          The toboggan bumps over the crest of a small hill and sails
          through the air, landing with a crash on the iced-over creek.
          John and Marley tumble into a snow bank on the opposite side.
          A moment. But then Marley jumps up and wriggles in delight.
          John painfully unfolds himself, checks for injuries. Marley
          comes up and romps with him.

                         JOHN
          Hey... wanna do it again?

                         JENNY
          John!

          182 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT 182

          John shuts off all of the lights, heads upstairs. We follow
          him up the stairs. He stops near the top, peers through the
          bannister into...

          183 PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 183
          From the low angle of the stairs, Patrick lies on his side,
          sleeping. And then we see Marley's head rise and reveal
          itself as Marley lifts it to look at John standing there.
          He'd been laying there on the bed behind Patrick. He looks
          at John, knows he's not supposed to be there, but...

                         JOHN
          That's alright, pal. I won't tell.

                         (THEN)
          We kicked ass down that hill, didn't
          we?
          John smiles at him and continues up to bed.

          184 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON 184

          Early Spring. The snow has melted. Marley, still as a
          statue, sits at the side of the road, waiting. Suddenly, he
          stands up and starts to wag his tail.



                         

                         

                         

                         
            105.

                         184

                         184 CONTINUED:
          A moment later, a yellow dot appears on the horizon. As it
          gets closer, Marley gets more and more excited as we now see
          that the dot is a SCHOOL BUS. It pulls to a stop beside
          Marley. Conor and Patrick get off and are greeted by Marley.

                         PATRICK
          Hey, boy.
          We HOLD WIDE ON THEIR BACKS as the boys start up the road
          towards home, Marley bounding between them, nipping at
          Patrick's backpack.

                         185

          185 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DUSK

          John pulls up as the boys now throw a football back and forth
          while Marley leaps into the air, trying to intercept it. John
          gets out of the car, claps his hands, holds them up...

                         JOHN
          Hit me, I'm open!
          Patrick throws the ball to John who catches it, mocks stiff-
          arms his way to the front steps with the boys now hanging off
          him as he gives the play-by-play...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          My God, look at Grogan-- two three-
          hundred pound linemen literally hanging
          off him, but he won't be denied!
          And now Marley jumps on them.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Ohhh, out of nowhere, a brutal hit from
          the Strong Safety and the unthinkable
          happens... GROGAN GOES DOWN...
          And he collapses with the boys at the foot of the. steps,
          Marley all over them, licking whatever faces he can get.
          Colleen comes out the front door, stands at the top of the
          steps...

                         COLLEEN
          Mommy says dinner and take off your
          shoes.

                         JOHN
          Alright... c'mon guys...
          They all get up, start up the steps. Marley follows, takes
          one step when his hind legs buckle. John looks back at him.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
          You okay, boy? C'mon...
          Marley tries the second step and again his legs give out. He
          looks up at them...

                         CONOR
          What's wrong with him, Daddy?

                         PATRICK

                         (QUICKLY)
          Nothing's wrong. He's just tired.
          Right, Dad?
          John sees the way Patrick is looking at him, knows he's
          protecting his little brother.

                         JOHN
          That's right. Football just took it
          out of him. C'mon, let's give him a
          hand.
          And now the three of them go to Marley, help him up the
          stairs.

          186 INT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER - EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY

          John sits across from the editor.

                         JOHN
          Too much color.

                         EDITOR
          Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's
          a good piece, but... you're reporting
          now, John. I want you to tell the
          story, I don't want you to be in the

                         STORY--

                         JOHN
          I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself--

                         EDITOR
          The point is, I still feel you in
          there.
          John sits there, thinking about that.

                         EDITOR (CONT'D)
          All I'm saying is: less you, more
          facts.

          Marley snores on the floor while John, Jenny and the kids all
          watch a movie together. Suddenly, they all take a whiff, then
          wince at once...

                         CONOR
          Marley!
          They all begin waving their hands in front of their faces.

                         JENNY
          I think someone needs to go out.

                         JOHN

                         (GETS UP)
          Come on, boy...
          Marley gets to his feet, follows John to the front door.

           He grabs his slicker and heads back out...

          As John returns, steps outside, but Marley is nowhere to be
          seen. John, claps his hand and whistles...

                         JOHN
          Marley!
          Now Jenny appears in the front door.

                         JENNY
          What's wrong?

                         JOHN
          He's not coming.

                         JENNY
          Marley!
          John starts off into the dark...

          He's just out exploring. You know how
          much he likes the woods.

                         PATRICK
          Bobby says dogs, when they're going to
          die, they go away to do it. That's
          what his beagle did.

                         JOHN
          And that's true... for beagles. But
          not labs like Marley. He's just out
          there making trouble somewhere. Don't

          John and Jenny run to'a tree at the edge of the property.
          Marley lies on the ground, in a hollow, hidden from view from
          the hill above. His belly is swollen, his face drawn. It's
          clear he's very ill.

                         JOHN
          It's okay, boy, it's okay...

                         197

          197 INT. VETERINARY TREATMENT ROOM - NIGHT

          John stands with DR. PLATT, a female vet. Marley lies on the
          floor in a dog bed, an IV is going into his paw.

          DR. PLATT
          He's on an IV for fluids and a
          sedative.

                         JOHN
          So what happened?

          DR. PLATT
          His stomach twisted. He ate or drank
          something quickly, took in a lot of air
          and his stomach flipped. I got a tube
          down which let out some of the gas. I
          think i untwisted it.

                         JOHN
          So he's okay...

          DR. PLATT
          For now. But once this happens, it
          almost always happens again. And if it
          does, there's not gonna be anything I
          can do. He's too old for that kind of
          surgery.

                         JOHN
          What if it doesn't happen again?

          DR. PLATT
          More than likely, it will.

                         JOHN
          But what if it doesn't?

          DR. PLATT
          I just think you should prepare
          yourself that he might not make it
          through the night.

          One percent? What's that number based

          Mr. Grogan--

                         JOHN
          I'll tell you what it's based on:
          regular dogs.
          (getting worked up)
          Lady, we are so far from 'regular", you
          have no idea.

                         (INDICATES MARLEY)
          My guy here... He once ate an entire
          answering machine, and digested it.
          Then went back and ate the phone for
          dessert. So don't give me numbers like
          "one percent," because you don't know
          him. But I do, and I'll see him in the
          morning.
          We TRACK WITH JOHN as he storms out of the exam room, walks
          down the hall, goes through waiting room, then he PASSES US
          as he goes out into the dark parking lot, walks to his car
          and stops.
          We stay BEHIND HIM as he leans with one hand on his car, and
          doesn't move.

                         198

          198 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Jenny's sitting at the table looking through a thick album
          when John comes in. She looks up at him expectantly.

                         JOHN
          We're just gonna have to wait and see.
          If he makes it through the night, I
          think we'll be alright.
          He notices the album.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          What're you looking at?

                         JENNY
          Your old columns. He's in a lot of
          'em.

          John rotates the album for a better look.

                         JOHN
          You saved these?

                         JENNY
          Every one.
          He looks up at her.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          Even on the crappiest day, when the
          boys were driving me nuts and the
          laundry wasn't done and a hundred other
          things were hard, I knew I had this.
          (taps the book)
          Five minutes of you. Sometimes they
          were funny and sometimes they were sad,
          or silly or whatever, but they were all
          you. And for those five minutes, you
          made me feel better.
          She gets up, comes over to him, leans down and kisses his
          head. Then, as she starts out...

                          JENNY (CONT'D)
           You should read them. They're pretty
           great.

          199 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAWN

           The sun just coming up. We hear A PHONE RING OVER.

                          200

          200 INT. KITCHEN - SANE

          As John, his head on the table, asleep, pops up at the sound
          of the ring and grabs the phone.

                         JOHN
          Hello?
          (listens, then)
          Alright. Thank you.
          He hangs up, sees Jenny now standing in the doorway, tying
          her robe, looking at him anxiously.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           He's coming home.

          201 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - EVENING

          As John pulls up. He gets out of the SUV, walks around and
          opens the back window and now Marley sits up into view.

           COLLEEN (O.S.)
          Marley's back!
          John opens the tail gate just as the kids come rushing onto
          the porch, Marley's tail wagging as he's lifted out of the
          car and set on the ground, the kids now surrounding him...

          202 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

          Loft. Downtown. Full of unpacked boxes. A mattress on the
          floor. Expensive electronics sit atop their cartons. John
          follows Sebastian on a "tour."

                         JOHN
          Nice place. How long you been here?

                         SEBASTIAN
          Two years, little more.
          Sebastian sees John looking at all of the unpacked boxes.

                         SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          I'm in and out of town so much I really
          haven't had a chance to settle in. I
          hired a decorator, but she and I got
          into a thing and it got messy--

                         JOHN
          Right.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Beer?

                         JOHN
          I can't, I still got one more interview
          to do.

                         A
          Sebastian opens the fridge revealing nothing but beer and
          hunk of Parmesan.

                         SEBASTIAN
          What's the piece again?

                         JOHN

          U.N.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Right, you told me that. So you're
          down in Philly now, huh?

                         JOHN
          Just outside. More space for the kids.

          Whatta you got, five now?

                         JOHN
          Three. Here's a picture of
          everybody...
          John pulls a photo from his wallet, hands it to Sebastian.

                         SEBASTIAN

                         (NODS)
          Jenny's holding up.

                         JOHN
          (ignores the callowness)
          Yeah, she's great. And that's Colleen
          our youngest...

                         SEBASTIAN
          What's with the ladybug get-up?

                         JOHN
          (smiling at the memory)
          Oh, yeah, that's a funny story. She
          had done this pageant at her preschool
          two weeks before, but she didn't wanna
          take off the costume, plus Marley went
          ballistic for the antenna which is why
          it looks like he's trying to eat her
          head.

                         SEBASTIAN

                         (FLAT)
          Yeah, that is funny.
          (returns the photo)
          So I was thinking later on maybe Thai?
          There's this new place in the meat
          Packing District. How's that sound? Be
          just like old times.
          John stands there a moment, feeling the distance between
          them.

                         JOHN
          Uh, well, actually I'm headed back home
          later today.

                         SEBASTIAN
          Oh.

                         JOHN
          In fact, I should probably get going...

                          SEBASTIAN
           Alright.
          (awkward Man-pat hug)
          Good seeing you, man.

                         JOHN
          For sure.

                         SEBASTIAN
          (walking him out)
          Oh, hey, be sure to check out the
          Delegates Lounge at the U.N... Great
          Mojitos, really hot interpreters.

                         JOHN
          Thanks for the tip.
          And John goes out the door. Sebastian takes out his
          blackberry, dials...

                         SEBASTIAN
          Hey, it's Sea-bass. What're you up to
          tonight?

                         (THEN)
          Oh. No, that's cool. Another time
          then.
          He hangs up, stands there in the middle of his big, empty
          apartment a moment. He then dials another number.

                         SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Hey, it's Sea-bass. What's going on?

          As a cab pulls away and John carries his suitcase up onto the
          porch.

                         204

          204 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

           John enters the house, sets down his suitcase.

                          JOHN
           Hello? Anybody home?
          He sees a note ("PICKING UP THE KIDS. J"), and peers into:

                         THE KITCHEN
          Where Marley is up on his hind legs, eating something off the
          counter. John puts his keys down, but Marley doesn't react.
          John sneaks up behind him. Marley keeps eating the grilled
          cheese sandwich off the plate...

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
          Marley? Hey, boy.
          Marley looks up briefly as if he heard something, but then
          returns to eating. John is right behind him. John reaches
          out and touches Marley, and Marley jumps, totally guilty.
          Then he turns and greets John.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          What's the matter, boy? You didn't
          hear me? Huh?
          He looks at the dog a moment, thoughtful, then...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Let's go for a walk.

                         205

          205 EXT. HILL - DAY

          As John walks Marley off leash up a hill. At one point, John
          has to stop and wait for Marley to catch up.

                         JOHN
          Come on, boy, just a little further to
          the top...
          Marley comes up, panting, eyes wet and happy. John looks at
          him, can see how tired he is.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          You know what, this is a good spot
          right here.
          John looks out at the valley below, settles down onto the
          damp earth beside Marley.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Let's just sit for a while.
          The two of them sit there, looking out at the beautiful
          countryside below. John strokes Marley for a moment. Looks
          at the grey hair, the tired eyes that now look back at him.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Hey. So... you're gonna tell me,
          right? When it's time? Because I
          don't wanna make that decision on my
          own. So you just let me know when
          you're ready, okay?
          Marley rests his chin on John's arm.

          Marley?
          (turns to John)
          Have you seen him?

                         JOHN
           He's not up here.

                          207

          John and Jenny find Marley lying peacefully in front of the
          dying fire.

                         JOHN
          I guess I could move his bed down here.
          John sits down beside Marley.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Man. He's always slept with us. Now
          he can't even make it upstairs.

                         JENNY
          He looks pretty comfortable to me.

                         (THEN)
          I'll go get his bed.

                         JOHN
          Hey Jen? why don't you grab a blanket
          for me, too.
          She nods, starts back up the stairs. John grabs a pillow
          from the couch and lays down beside Marley.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          This is a good spot. I may never sleep
          upstairs again.

          JENNY (O.S.)
          Hey. Scooch over.
          He looks up and see that Jenny's brought a blanket. She lies
          down with them. John puts his arm around them both.
          Marley's tail begins gently pounding the floor.

          It'd be twice a week. Six hundred
          words.

                         EDITOR
          And what's the subject?

                         JOHN
          Everyday stuff. The stuff we all go
          through. But funnier.

                         EDITOR
          I don't get it. I thought you came
          here to be a reporter.

                         JOHN
          I did, but I think we both know that
          isn't me. I'm a columnist. A good
          one.
          A SECRETARY sticks her head in the office...

                         SECRETARY
          John-- your wife's on the phone. She
          says it's important...

                         JOHN
          I'll be right there.

          Jenny and Patrick are sitting on the floor. Marley is lying
          on the dining room floor, breathing heavily.

                         JENNY
          Patrick came home and we got him here.
          Dr. Platt said if he's comfortable,
          leave him here for a while and see.
          But he's no better.
          John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag
          his tail or lick his hand. He runs his hand over his coat -
          then over his stomach, the dog flinches.

                         JOHN
          I'm taking him in.
          The kids all come into the room, Colleen carrying a stuffed
          sheep.

                         COLLEEN
          Is he sick again?

                         JOHN
          Yeah, he is, honey. But I'm going to
          take him to the hospital and they'll
          try to make him better.
          Conor bends down, nuzzles Marley's face.

                         CONOR
          Get better, Mar.

                         COLLEEN
          You can take Lamby, okay?
          (she puts the stuffed animal
          next to him)
          But don't chew her other ear off.
          Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers right in

                         HIS EAR:

                         PATRICK
          Goodbye.
          When he looks up at his father, John can see that Patrick's
          crying, that he knows what the other two don't.

          212 EXT. VET'S - NIGHT 212

          John lifts Marley out of the car. Marley seems a little more
          alert.



                         

                         

                         

                         

            119.
           

                          212

                         212 CONTINUED:

                         JOHN
          You wanna walk?
          He sets him down gingerly. Hesitantly, Marley walks over to
          the tree that countless dogs have peed on, sniffs it, then
          looks around. John looks around, too. It's a crisp spring
          night in Pennsylvania. Takes a breath...

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Nice night, huh?
          Marley looks around, then looks at John. There's something
          in his expression. John nods, knows what he's saying.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Okay, boy.
          (as Marley moves close)
          Okay.
          John, his heart breaking, bends down to carry Marley up the
          front steps of the clinic.

                         213

          213 INT. VET WAITING ROOM - LATER

          John stands as Dr. Platt comes out...

          DR. PLATT
          I did everything that worked before.
          But no luck. There's still surgery,

                         BUT HE'S--

                         JOHN
          --not strong enough.

          DR. PLATT
          There's blood in his stomach. The
          lining might be compromised. I don't
          know what we'll find if we go in there
          anyway.

                         JOHN
          Can you give me a minute? I need to...
          I need to call my wife.

                         214

          214 EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          John's on his cell phone...

                         JOHN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          It's me. It's the stomach thing again.
          Nothing's working. They could do
          surgery, but...

          Jenny listens to John on the phone.

                         JENNY
          I know.
          Jenny nods as tears come. They stay on the phone, quiet,
          just being with each other. Finally:

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          I love you, John.

                         216

                         217

          217 INT. EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT

          John enters. Marley is on the table, zonked out. Dr. Platt
          has put a blanket on the cold metal table so Marley is warm.

          DR. PLATT
          I'll give you some time.
          She goes. John stares down at Marley. Takes the stuffed
          lamb out of his pocket, places it under a paw. When John
          puts a hand on his flank, Marley's eyes flutter open. His
          tail THUMPS gently.

                         JOHN
          Hey, buddy.
          He pets Marley's head, runs his hands all over Marley's body.
          His coat, still shedding. His tail. He takes up each paw,
          each ear, remembering and memorizing at the same time. He
          leans down, puts his nose on Marley's neck and breathes him
          in. Then he goes around, squats down so he's on Marley's
          level. He looks into Marley's eyes.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)
          Listen, you know all that stuff we
          always said about you? What a total
          pain you are? The world's worst dog?
          Well, don't you believe it. Don't
          believe it for a minute. You loved us,
          every day, no matter what. And that's
          a pretty amazing thing.
          (he leans in)

                          JOHN (CONT'D)
          Look, I don't know where you're going
          from here, but you remember this:
          You're a great dog, Marley. You are a
          great dog.

          218 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 218

          In the BEDROOM, Jenny sits on the bed, the phone in her hand,
          waiting, we BEGIN PULLING AWAY DOWN THE HALLWAY.

          219 INT. CLINIC - NIGHT 219

          Dr. Platt is in the room now. John, his hand on one of
          Marley's paws, kneels on the ground, looking at Marley,
          Marley lays on the table, looking right back at him.

          DR. PLATT
          He won't feel a thing. He'll just slip
          away. Are you ready?

                         JOHN
          (looking at Marley)
          We're ready.
          Dr. Platt inserts the needle into the I.V. and presses the
          plunger.

          220 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT 220

          As a pajama-clad Patrick slips a tape into the VCR...

          221 INT. CLINIC - NIGHT 221

          As we now HOLD ON MARLEY'S EYES, slowly beginning to close.

          222 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 222

          As Jenny sits vigil by the phone, we CONTINUE PULLING BACK.

          223 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT 223

          As Patrick sits alone in the dark living room, his face
          illuminated by the TV, as he watches SILENT IMAGES from
          Grogan family home videos:
          TWO-YEAR-OLD PATRICK rides on Marley's back through the house
          at 345 Churchill, young Marley's tail knocking over
          everything within range, toddler and dog both joyous.

                         224

          224 INT. CLINIC - NIGHT

          As Marley's eyes finally close. The CAMERA drifts to John's
          hand, stroking Marley's side. Dr. Platt listens to Marley's
          heart and says:

          DR. PLATT
          He's gone.
          FROM ABOVE, the dog on the table, the doctor discreetly going
          to the side, and John laying his head next to Marley and
          putting his arms around him as we now...

                         225

          225 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

          As the five Grogans walk across the-property. Colleen sits
          on John's shoulders. They reach a clearing where we see a
          small grave has been dug. John sets Colleen down...

                         COLLEEN
          He's wrapped in his blanket...

                         JOHN
          So he'll be warm.

                         JENNY
          You guys want to read your letters?

                         COLLEEN
          Mine is a picture. Of me and Marley.
          And grasshoppers. And ice cream.
          Mommy wrote what I said. "Dear Marley.
          I will never forget you, forever." And
          those are kisses.

                         JOHN
          It's beautiful, honey. He'll like it.
          Drop it in. Conor?
          Conor reads his piece of paper.

                         CONOR
          "Dear Marley. I loved you all my life.
          I hope you like heaven and that there's
          lots to chew on. Your brother, Conor
          Richard Grogan."
          John puts his hand on Conor's shoulder as Conor drops in the
          letter into the grave.

                         JENNY
          Patrick? Do you want to say anything?



                         

                         

                         

                         


                          225

                         225 CONTINUED:

                         PATRICK
          He knows.

                         JENNY
          I'd like to give him something.
          Jenny reaches behind her neck and unclasps the gold necklace
          John gave Jenny when she first got pregnant.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
          This little necklace has been on quite
          a journey.
          John smiles at her, remembering. So much shared history.

                         JOHN
          Your dad gave this to me to celebrate
          the beginning of our family. But you
          know what? Our family had already
          begun.
          She looks into the grave, gently sets the necklace atop the
          blanket, lets her hand rest there a moment, then stands up.

                         JENNY
          Good-bye, Clearance Puppy.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          226 EXT. GRAVE SITE - LATER 226

          John puts few big stones on top of the tamped-down earth. He
          sits on his haunches beside the grave, looks up at the house
          across the yard.

          JOHN'S POV - THE HOUSE
          All lit up. We see the kids sitting by the fire while Jenny
          moves about the kitchen getting dinner ready.
          John sits there watching them. watching his family. The
          family that both he and Marley grew up in.
          He gives the fresh dirt a final, loving pat and then, as the
          last bit of sun goes down, he stands up, and heads for home.

                                           1955

                

               NEW YORK CITY, 187TH STREET. A SUMMER DAY

               FADE IN:

               Just east of Webster Avenue in the North Bronx, 187th Street 
               is a predominantly Italian community and the commercial avenue 
               of the neighborhood. Fruit and vegetable stands, pizzerias, 
               butcher shops, bakeries, cleaners and dyers and bars flourish. 
               It is Saturday morning around eleven o'clock -- a market 
               day.

               WOMEN, dark, gesticulative, with bulging cloth shopping bags, 
               baby carriages. MERCHANTS at their improvised street stands, 
               hawking their wares, disputing with their CUSTOMERS, roaring 
               salutations to PASSERSBY.

               In the midst of all this, CAMERA HOMES IN on a typical 
               neighborhood...

               BUTCHER SHOP.

               Delicatessens hang on the walls, wreathed with garlands of 
               garlic. PATSY, the boss, a swarthy man of sixty, is flopping 
               a chunk of beef onto the scale for the benefit of a forty-
               year-old MATRON. There are three or four other WOMEN in the 
               shop, all talking to one another. A four-year-old BOY lazily 
               chases a cat.

               The white refrigerator room door opens, and a second butcher, 
               MARTY PILLETTI, comes out carrying a large leg of lamb. Marty 
               is a mildmannered, short, stout, balding man of thirty-four. 
               His charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor. He 
               drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block, reaches up 
               for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the 
               block and makes quick incisive cuts into the leg of lamb. He 
               sets the cleaver aside, picks up the saw to finish the cuts 
               as he chats with his customer, MRS. FUSARI.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         Your kid brother got married last 
                         Sunday, eh, Marty?

                                     MARTY
                              (sawing away)
                         That's right, Missus Fusari. It was 
                         a very nice affair.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         That's the big tall one, the fellow 
                         with the moustache.

                                     MARTY
                              (still sawing)
                         No, that's my other brother, Freddie. 
                         My other brother Freddie, he's been 
                         married four years already. He lives 
                         down on Webb Avenue. The one who got 
                         married Sunday, that was my little 
                         brother, Nickie.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         I thought he was a big tall fat 
                         fellow. Didn't I meet him here one 
                         time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried 
                         to sell me life insurance?

               Marty sets the five chops on the scale, watches its weight 
               register.

                                     MARTY
                         No, that's my sister Margaret's 
                         husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, 
                         she's married to the insurance 
                         salesman, and my sister Rose, she 
                         married a contractor. They moved to 
                         Detroit last year. And my other sister 
                         Frances, she got married about two 
                         and a half years ago in Saint John's 
                         Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, 
                         that was a big affair. Well, let's 
                         see now, that'll be about a dollar-
                         seventy-nine. How's that with you?

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         Well...

               Mrs. Fusari produces an old leather change purse from her 
               pocketbook and painfully extracts one single dollar bill and 
               seventy-nine cents to the penny and lays the money piece by 
               piece on the counter. From the rear of the shop a woman's 
               VOICE rings out.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Hey, Marty, I'm inna hurry.

                                     MARTY
                         You're next right now, Missus Canduso.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         When you gonna get married, Marty? 
                         You should be ashamed of yourself. 
                         All your brothers and sisters, they 
                         all younger than you, they married 
                         and they got children. I just saw 
                         your mother inna fruit shop, and she 
                         says to me, "Hey, you know a nice 
                         girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter 
                         with you? That's no way. Now you get 
                         married.

                                     MARTY
                              (amiably)
                         Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over 
                         there, she's inna big hurry, and...

               Mrs. Fusari takes her parcel of meat, but apparently she 
               feels she still hasn't quite made her point.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         My son Frank, he was married when he 
                         was nineteen years old. Watsa matter 
                         with you?

                                     MARTY
                         That's swell, Missus Fusari.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         You should be ashamed of yourself.

               She takes her package of meat. Marty gathers up the money on 
               the counter, turns to the cash register behind him to ring 
               up the sale. Mrs. Canduso sidles up to the counter.

                                     MRS. CANDUSO
                         Marty, I want a nice, big fat pullet, 
                         about four pounds. I hear your kid 
                         brother got married last Sunday.

                                     MARTY
                         Yeah, it was a very nice affair.

                                     MRS. CANDUSO
                         Marty, you oughta be ashamed. All 
                         your kid brothers and sisters married 
                         and have children. When you gonna 
                         get married?

               NEIGHBORHOOD BAR. LATE AFTERNOON

               A TV set on the wall. Mel Allen, smoking a White Owl cigar, 
               is recapping the baseball game that has just finished as 
               Marty comes in.

                                     MARTY
                              (to two YOUNG MEN 
                              leaving)
                         What happened?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         The Yanks took two.

                                     MARTY
                         Any homers?

               The Young Men exit without answering. Marty moves further 
               into the bar, which is crowded with locals, smoky, noisy. 
               ACROSS GROUP at bar with Marty in the background approaching, 
               we see a group consisting of RALPH, who wears a suit and 
               tie, the only man in the room who isn't in shirtsleeves or a 
               Basque shirt; JOE, thirty-two, hunched over a girlie magazine; 
               a KID, twenty-two, studying the magazine over Joe's shoulder.

                                     MARTY
                              (to the Kid)
                         Angie come in yet?

               The Kid indicates a booth where a small wasp of a man, mid-
               thirties, is sitting, bent over the sports pages of the Daily 
               News.

                                     RALPH
                         So these two girls come over to the 
                         bar...

                         You want a beer, Ang'?

                                     RALPH

                         nurses, Marty...

                              (to Joe studying his 
                              magazine)
                         Waddaya read there, Joe?

                                     RALPH
                         Turns out these two girls are nurses 
                         in some hospital on a Hundred and 
                         Fourth Street...

                                     JOE
                         They shouldn't sell magazines like 
                         this on a public newsstand...

                                     MARTY
                         That's the truth.

                                     JOE
                              (turning a page)
                         Can you imagine the effect this has 
                         on adolescents?

                                     RALPH
                         So, Marty, let me tell you about 
                         these nurses...

                              Bartender)
                         What nurses?

                                     RALPH
                         The nurses Leo and me picked up last 
                         night. We got a date with them 
                         tonight.

                              (moving off to Angie's 
                              booth)
                         You still owe me ten bucks from last 
                         week, if that's what you're working 
                         up to.

               Joe turns another page in the girlie magazine.

                                     JOE
                         Now that's something, eh?

               THE BOOTH.

               Marty joins his friend Angie and pushes a bottle of beer at 
               him, pulling one of the pages loose from the paper Angie is 
               reading. For a moment, the two men sit quietly, each poring 
               over his separate piece of newspaper.

                                     ANGIE
                              (without looking up)
                         So waddaya feel like doing tonight?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel 
                         like doing?

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, we oughta do something. It's 
                         Saturday night. I don't wanna go 
                         bowling like last Saturday. How about 
                         calling up that big girl we picked 
                         up inna movies about a month ago in 
                         the RKO Chester?

                                     MARTY
                              (not very interested)
                         Which one was that?

                                     ANGIE
                         That big girl that was sitting in 
                         front of us with the skinny friend.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     ANGIE
                         We took them home alla way out in 
                         Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. 
                         What do you say? You think I oughta 
                         give her a ring? I'll take the skinny 
                         one.

                                     MARTY
                         She probably got a date by now, Angie.

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, let's call her up. What can we 
                         lose?

                                     MARTY
                         I didn't like her, Angie. I don't 
                         feel like calling her up.

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, what do you feel like doing 
                         tonight?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know. What do you feel like 
                         doing?

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, we're back to that, huh? I say 
                         to you, "What do you feel like doing 
                         tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't 
                         know, what do you feel like doing?" 
                         And then we wind up sitting around 
                         your house with a coupla cansa beer, 
                         watching Sid Caesar on television. 
                         Well, I tell you what I feel like 
                         doing. I feel like calling up this 
                         Mary Feeney. She likes you.

                                     MARTY
                         What makes you say that?

                                     ANGIE
                         I could see she likes you.

                                     MARTY
                         Yeah, sure.

                                     ANGIE
                              (half-rising in his 
                              seat)
                         I'll call her up.

                                     MARTY
                         You call her up for yourself, Angie. 
                         I don't feel like calling her up.

               Angie sits down again. They both return to their papers for 
               a moment. Then Angie looks up again.

                                     ANGIE
                         How about going downa Seventy-Second 
                         Street, see what we can find? Ralph 
                         says you have to beat them off with 
                         clubs.

               Marty makes a wry face at the suggestion.

                                     ANGIE
                         Boy, you're getting to be a real 
                         drag, you know that?

                                     MARTY
                         Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I 
                         been looking for a girl every Saturday 
                         night of my life. I'm tired of 
                         looking. Everybody's always telling 
                         me to get married. Get married. Get 
                         married. Don't you think I wanna get

                         drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna 
                         wreck your Saturday night for you,

                         go ahead. I don't wanna go.

                                     ANGIE
                         My old lady, every word outta her 
                         mouth, when you gonna get married?

                         My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.

               Angie leans back in his seat, scowls at the paper napkin 
               container on the booth table. Marty returns to the sports 
               page. For a moment, a silence hangs between them.

                                     ANGIE
                         So what do you feel like doing 
                         tonight?

                                     MARTY
                              (without looking up)
                         I don't know. What do you feel like 
                         doing?

                              to Angie)
                         Come on over about half past seven, 
                         we'll think of something.

                         Hello, Ma, what's the matter?

               PILLETTI HOME, LIVING ROOM.

               It's a typical lower-middle-class Italian home, and MRS. 
               PILLETTI is on the phone, a round, dark woman. Beyond her, 
               in the dining room, we can see a young couple -- THOMAS, 
               Marty's cousin, and his wife VIRGINIA, seated at the dining 
               room table.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (voice lowered)
                         Hello, Marty, when you coming home? 
                         Where you now? Because your cousin 
                         Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're 
                         here. They had another fight with 
                         your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...

               THE BAR.

                                     MARTY
                              (in the phone booth)
                         I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll 
                         be home in about two minutes. Tell 
                         Thomas stick around, I wanna see him 
                         about something.

               PILLETTI HOME, LIVING ROOM.

               Mrs. Pilletti is on the phone.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Okay, you come on home, okay.

               She hangs up, braces herself, turns and starts back to Thomas 
               and Virginia in the dining room.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         He coming home right now.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about 
                         the milk bottle was my mother-in-
                         law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt 
                         Theresa, and she begins poking her 
                         head over my shoulder here and poking 
                         her head over my shoulder there, so 
                         then she begins telling me how I 
                         waste money and how I can't cook, 
                         and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, 
                         so she got me so nervous, I spilled 
                         some milk I was making for the baby...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She was here, you know, Wednesday, 
                         and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."

                                     VIRGINIA
                         So she say, "You're spilling the 
                         milk." So she kept talking about 
                         these coupla drops of milk I spilled, 
                         so she got me so mad, so I said, 
                         "Mama, you wanna see me really spill 
                         some milk?" So I took the bottle, 
                         and I threw it against the door. I 
                         didn't throw it at her. That's just 
                         something she made up. She goes around 
                         telling everybody I threw the bottla 
                         milk at her. I didn't throw it 
                         anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry 
                         right away, you know, but she ran 
                         outta the house.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, I don't know what you want me 
                         to do, Virginia. If you want me, 
                         I'll go talk to her tonight.

               Thomas and Virginia suddenly frown and look down at their 
               hands as if of one mind.

                                     THOMAS
                         Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Lemme tell it, Tommy.

                                     THOMAS
                         Okay.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         We want you to do a very big favor 
                         for us, Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Aunt Theresa, you got this big house 
                         here. I mean, you got this big house 
                         just for you and Marty. And I thought 
                         maybe Tommy's mother could come here 
                         and live with you and Marty.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Because I called up Tommy's brother 
                         Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving 
                         me crazy. Why don't you take her for 
                         a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh 
                         no!" I know I sound like a terrible 
                         woman...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         No, Virginia, I know how you feel.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         I just can't stand it any more! Every 
                         minute of the day! Do this! Do that! 
                         I don't have ten minutes privacy 
                         with my husband! We can't even have 
                         a fight! We don't have no privacy! 
                         Everybody's miserable in our house!

                                     THOMAS
                         All right, Ginnie, don't get so 
                         excited.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She's right. She's right. Young 
                         husband and wife, they should have 
                         their own home. And my sister 
                         Catherine, she's my sister, but I 
                         gotta admit, she's an old goat. And 
                         plenty-a times in my life, I feel 
                         like throwing the milk bottle at her 
                         myself. And I tell you now, as far 
                         as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa 
                         come live here with me and Marty, 
                         it's all right with me.

               Virginia promptly bursts into tears.

                                     THOMAS
                              (not far from tears 
                              himself, lowers his 
                              face)
                         That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         We gotta ask Marty, of course.

                                     THOMAS
                         Sure.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (rises)
                         You just sit here, I gotta turn the 
                         fire on under the cooking.
                              (exits into the kitchen)

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (having mastered her 
                              tears)
                         That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.

                                     THOMAS
                              (calling to his aunt 
                              in the kitchen)
                         How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (off-screen)
                         Oh, he's fine. You know a nice girl 
                         he can marry?

               She comes back into the dining room, wiping her hands on a 
               kitchen towel.

                                     THOMAS
                         Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, 
                         Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (sitting down again)
                         Well, I don't know. He sits arounna 
                         house alla time. You know a place he 
                         can go where he can find a bride?

                                     THOMAS
                         Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. 
                         That's a kind of a big dance hall. 
                         Every Saturday night, it's just loaded 
                         with girls. It's a nice place to go. 
                         You pay seventy-seven cents. It used 
                         to be seventy-seven cents. It must 
                         be about a buck and half now. And 
                         you go in and you ask some girl to 
                         dance. That's how I met Virginia. 
                         Nice, respectable place to meet girls. 
                         You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you 
                         tell him, "Go to the Stardust 
                         Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (committing the line 
                              to memory)
                         The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded 
                         with tomatoes.

                                     THOMAS
                         Right.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         This is very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa, 
                         what you're doing for us, and don't 
                         think we don't appreciate...

               The SOUND of the DOOR BEING UNLATCHED in the kitchen can be 
               heard. Mrs. Pilletti promptly rises.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         He's here.

               She hurries into...

               THE KITCHEN.

               Marty comes into the kitchen from the rear porch.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Ma.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (whispers)
                         Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. 
                         They had another fight with your 
                         Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would 
                         it be all right if Catherine come to 
                         live with us. So I said, all right 
                         with me, but we have to ask you. 
                         Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody 
                         wants her. Everybody's throwing her 
                         outta their house...

                                     MARTY
                         Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You gotta good heart.

               She turns and leads the way back into the dining room. Marty 
               follows.

               DINING ROOM.

               Thomas has risen. Mrs. Pilletti and Marty come in.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         He says okay, it's all right Catherine 
                         comes here.

                                     THOMAS
                         Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really 
                         takes a load offa my mind.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, we got plenny-a room here.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's 
                         gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight 
                         to your house, and I talk with 
                         Catherine, and you see, everything 
                         is gonna work out all right.

                                     THOMAS
                         I just wanna thank you people again, 
                         because the situation was just 
                         becoming impossible.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Siddown, Thomas, siddown.

               She exits into the kitchen. Virginia follows her to the 
               kitchen door, where the two women ad-lib the following lines 
               over the ensuing scene between Marty and Thomas.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         That's all right, that's all right...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         On accounta...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I'm gonna see you tonight...

               Over this, Thomas talks to Marty.

                                     THOMAS
                         Marty, I don't know how to tell you 
                         how much I appreciate what you and 
                         your mother are doing, because the 
                         kinda thing was happening in our 
                         house was Virginia was in the kitchen 
                         making some milk for the baby. So my 
                         mother comes in...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Tommy, I promised the babysitter six 
                         o'clock.

                                     MARTY
                         Tommy, before you go, I wonder if 
                         you gimme a little advice.

                                     THOMAS
                         Sure, what?

                                     MARTY
                         You're the accountant inna family, 
                         and I figure you might know about 
                         these things. My boss wantsa sell 
                         his shop to me. His kids are all 
                         married, you know, and he and his 
                         wife live alone, and they wanna move 
                         out to California where his daughter 
                         lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. 
                         He wants five thousand dollars down, 
                         although I think I can knock him 
                         downa four...

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (off-screen, from 
                              deep in the kitchen)
                         Tommy!

                                     THOMAS
                              (rises)
                         I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll 
                         sit down and we'll discuss the whole 
                         thing.

                                     MARTY
                         All right, I'll see you, Thomas, 
                         because he wants an answer by Monday.

                                     THOMAS
                         Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. 
                         We'll work out some arrangement, 
                         because naturally I want to pay...

                                     MARTY
                         Don't worry about it.

                                     THOMAS
                         No, listen, that's my mother, I'm 
                         gonna pay for her...

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (off-screen)
                         Goodby, Marty!

                                     MARTY
                         Goodby, Virginia! See you soon!

               Thomas has moved off to join his wife in the kitchen where 
               we can hear them exchanging final protestations and goodbys 
               with Mrs. Pilletti. Marty sits at the table, hands folded in 
               front of him, stolid, pensive.

               THE KITCHEN. DUSK.

               Mrs. Pilletti bends over her steaming kettles. Through the 
               window we see evening is gathering.

               MARTY'S BEDROOM.

               It's a small room with bed, chest of drawers, religious 
               pictures, etc. Marty sits squatly on the edge of the bed, 
               absorbed in thought. He stands, moves out into...

               THE GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR.

               ...and down that into...

               THE DINING ROOM.

               ...now lit by the overhead neo-Tiffany lampshade and the 
               beaded old-fashioned lamps. He crosses to the kitchen door, 
               looks in on his mother, cooking away, turns, crosses back 
               to...

               THE LIVING ROOM.

               He closes the sliding doors that separate the living and 
               dining rooms. He extracts a small black address book from 
               his hip pocket, flips through it, finds the page he wants, 
               studies it intently.

               He sits on the chair by the phone, dials.

                                     MARTY
                              (with a vague pretense 
                              at good diction)
                         Hello, is this Mary Feeney?... Could 
                         I speak to Miss Mary Feeney?... Just 
                         tell her an old friend...

               He waits again. With his free hand he wipes the gathering 
               sweat on his brow.

                                     MARTY
                         ...Oh, hello there, is this Mary 
                         Feeney? Hello there, this is Marty 
                         Pilletti. I wonder if you recall 
                         me... Well, I'm kind of a stocky 
                         guy. The last time we met was in a 
                         movie, the RKO Chester. You was with 
                         another girl, and I was with a friend 
                         of mine named Angie. This was about 
                         a month ago...

               The girl apparently doesn't remember him. A sort of panic 
               begins to seize Marty. His voice rises a little.

                                     MARTY
                         The RKO Chester in Westchester Square. 
                         You was sitting in front of us, and 
                         we was annoying you, and you got 
                         mad, and... I'm the fellow who works 
                         in a butcher shop... Come on, you 
                         know who I am!... That's right, we 
                         went to Howard Johnson's and we had 
                         hamburgers. You hadda milkshake... 
                         Yeah, that's right. I'm the stocky 
                         one, the heavy-set feller... Well, 
                         I'm glad you recall me, because I 
                         hadda swell time that night, and I 
                         was just wondering how everything 
                         was with you. How's everything?... 
                         That's swell... Yeah, well, I'll 
                         tell you why I called...I was figuring 
                         on taking in a movie tonight, and I 
                         was wondering if you and your friend 
                         would care to see a movie tonight 
                         with me and my friend...
                              (his eyes are closed 
                              now)
                         Yeah, tonight. I know it's pretty 
                         late to call for a date, but I didn't 
                         know myself, till... Yeah, I know, 
                         well how about... Yeah, I know, well 
                         maybe next Saturday night. You free 
                         next Saturday night?... Well, how 
                         about the Saturday after that?... 
                         Yeah, I know... Yeah... Yeah... Oh, 
                         I understand, I mean...

               He hangs up, sits for a moment, then rises, opens the sliding 
               doors, enters...

               THE DINING ROOM.

               He sits at the heavy, wooden table with its white-on-white 
               table cloth.

               THE KITCHEN.

               Mrs. Pilletti ladles portions of food from the steaming 
               kettles onto a plate that she brings into...

               THE DINING ROOM.

               ...and sets it down before her son. Without a word, he picks 
               up his fork and spoon and plunges into the mountain of 
               spaghetti, adds cheese, eats away. Mrs. Pilletti takes her 
               seat, folds her hands on the table, and sits watching Marty 
               eat.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         So what are you gonna do tonight, 
                         Marty?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked 
                         out. I may just hang arounna house.

               Mrs. Pilletti nods a couple of times. A moment of silence.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Why don't you go to the Stardust 
                         Ballroom?

               This gives Marty pause. He looks up.

                                     MARTY
                         What?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I say, why don't you go to the 
                         Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with 
                         tomatoes.

               Marty regards his mother for a moment.

                                     MARTY
                         It's loaded with what?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Tomatoes.

                                     MARTY
                         Ha! Who told you about the Stardust 
                         Ballroom?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Thomas. He told me it was a very 
                         nice place.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance 
                         hall, and that's all it is. I been 
                         there a hundred times. Loaded with 
                         tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Marty, I don't want you hang arounna 
                         house tonight. I want you to go take 
                         a shave and go out and dance.

                                     MARTY
                         Ma, when are you gonna give up? You 
                         gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't 
                         never gonna get married.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You gonna get married.

                                     MARTY
                         Sooner or later, there comes a point 
                         in a man's life when he gotta face 
                         some facts, and one fact I gotta 
                         face is that whatever it is that 
                         women like, I ain't got it. I chased 
                         enough girls in my life. I went to 
                         enough dances. I got hurt enough. I 
                         don't wanna get hurt no more. I just 
                         called a girl just now, and I got a 
                         real brush-off, boy. I figured I was 
                         past the point of being hurt, but 
                         that hurt. Some stupid woman who I 
                         didn't even wanna call up. She gave 
                         me the brush. I don't wanna go to 
                         the Stardust Ballroom because all 
                         that ever happened to me there was 
                         girls made me feel like I was a bug. 
                         I got feelings, you know. I had enough 
                         pain. No, thank you.

                         Marty...

                                     MARTY
                         Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch 
                         Jackie Gleason.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You gonna die without a son.

                                     MARTY
                         So I'll die without a son.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Put on your blue suit...

                                     MARTY
                         Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a 
                         fat man. A fat ugly man.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You not ugly.

                                     MARTY
                              (his voice rising)
                         I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Marty...

                                     MARTY
                         Ma! Leave me alone!

               He stands abruptly, his face pained and drawn. He makes half-
               formed gestures to his mother, but he can't find words at 
               the moment. He turns and marches a few paces away, turns to 
               his mother again.

                                     MARTY
                         Ma, waddaya want from me?! Waddaya 
                         want from me?! I'm miserable enough 
                         as it is! Leave me alone! I'll go to 
                         the Stardust Ballroom! I'll put onna 
                         blue suit and I'll go! And you know 
                         what I'm gonna get for my trouble? 
                         Heartache! A big night of heartache!

               Sullenly, he marches back to his seat, sits down, picks up 
               his fork, plunges it into the spaghetti, stuffs a mouthful 
               into his mouth, and chews vigorously for a moment. It is 
               impossible for him to remain angry long. After a while, he 
               is shaking his head.

                                     MARTY
                         Loaded with tomatoes...boy, that's 
                         rich.

               He plunges his fork in again, starts to eat. Mrs. Pilletti 
               watches Marty anxiously as we...

               FADE OUT.

               FADE IN

               NEW YORK CITY, WEST FARMS SQUARE. NIGHT

               West Farms Square is a big street in the Bronx, filled with 
               stores, bowling alleys and bars. Cars push along between the 
               pillars of the elevated subway structure. The NOISE of the 
               subway trains ROARS by overhead every few moments.

               CAMERA FINDS and ESTABLISHES the Stardust Ballroom. It 
               occupies the second floor of a large, dirty gray three-story 
               building. It is a hot June night, and the windows are open 
               for ventilation purposes. MUSIC manufactured by Dave 
               Greenglass and His Band blends with the NOISES of the street.

               STARDUST BALLROOM. ENTRANCE VESTIBULE/STAIRS.

               MUSIC plays in the background. CAMERA views CLARA, a plain 
               girl in her late twenties; her younger sister, MILLIE, 
               prettier; Millie's fiance ANDY, 30; and a second young man 
               DR. KEEGAN, also 30, who is a resident at Fordham Hospital. 
               They are all huddled over a cigarette machine near the street 
               door.

                                     ANDY
                              (in a low voice)
                         I told you she wasn't especially 
                         attractive, but that she had a good 
                         deal of charm, and she's really a 
                         real nice girl...

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                              (extracting cigarettes 
                              from the machine)
                         She's all right, Andy. It's just 
                         that I get one Saturday night off 
                         every three weeks, and I was expecting 
                         something better, that's all.

                                     ANDY
                         I told you she wasn't attractive...

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         You told me that she was a little 
                         tall, but that she wasn't bad looking 
                         at all.

                                     ANDY
                         Millie's been after me to fix her up 
                         with a date, so I...

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         All right, I'm having a fair time. 
                         It's just that I get one Saturday 
                         night off in three weeks, and I wanted 
                         to wind up with something tonight.

               They join the two girls waiting for them and start up the 
               broad stairway to the second floor. They are halfway up, 
               when two GIRLS come in at the top of the stairs and start 
               down. Dr. Keegan, who is holding Clara's arm, looks up, nods.

               STARDUST BALLROOM, ANTEROOM.

               This is a small, carpeted lobby with TICKET TAKER in booth, 
               a cloak room and rest rooms. Painted posters on the walls 
               announce coming events and caution against smoking. There 
               are also large blow-ups of musicians who had played this 
               ballroom at one time and went on to bigger things. About six 
               or seven PEOPLE congregate in the lobby, engaged in various 
               indifferent activities.

               CAMERA ANGLES include the swinging doors, as Clara, Andy, 
               Millie and Dr. Keegan come in. As they enter, the doors to 
               the ballroom proper are pushed out, and a GIRL in a black 
               dress, quite pretty, comes in. She starts across the anteroom 
               toward the cloak room, when Dr. Keegan calls out suddenly to 
               her.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Hey!

               The girl turns. Recognition floods her face.

                                     GIRL
                         Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         I came up to dance, wadda you think? 
                         You here with somebody?

                                     GIRL
                         I'm just here with another girl.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Where you going now?

                                     GIRL
                         I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I 
                         left them in my coat.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         I'll see you around.

                                     GIRL
                         I'll see you.

               She turns and continues on to the cloak room. Dr. Keegan 
               turns to Clara.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         That's a girl used to know.

               BALLROOM, LOUNGE.

               A fairly long room, lined on one side by a bar and on the 
               other by cheap leatherette booths. It is brightly lit and 
               crowded. There is a constant movement in and out of the 
               lounge. At the far end of the lounge, there are two large 
               iron fire doors open to allow the heat to flow out. Dance 
               MUSIC from dance floor.

               Clara, Dr. Keegan, Millie and Andy come into the lounge and 
               form a little group in the midst of moving PASSERSBY around 
               them. A kind of strange excitement has begun to enter Dr. 
               Keegan. He stands with the others, but his attention is 
               devoted to ogling the passing GIRLS, occasionally looking 
               back to the doors leading to the anteroom.

                                     ANDY
                         Boy, it's packed in here.

                                     MILLIE
                              (to Clara)
                         Some of these kids are awful young. 
                         Aren't you afraid you'll bump into 
                         one of your students?

                                     CLARA
                              (nervously looking at 
                              Dr. Keegan)
                         I wouldn't think so. I teach out in 
                         Brooklyn.

                                     ANDY
                         You been up here before, Clara?

                                     CLARA
                         Yeah, twice.

                                     MILLIE
                         Shall we try to get a table and get 
                         something to drink or shall we just 
                         go in and start dancing?

                                     ANDY
                         Hey, Herbie...

               Dr. Keegan doesn't seem to hear.

                                     ANDY
                              (continues)
                         Hey, Herbie...

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         What?

                                     ANDY
                         You wanna have a drink before we 
                         start dancing?

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Listen. You people go grab a table. 
                         I'll be back inna minute. I'll be 
                         right back.

               He turns and moves quickly through the crowded lounge, back 
               to the swinging doors leading into the anteroom. CAMERA STAYS 
               with Clara, Millie and Andy staring after him.

                                     ANDY
                         So what do you say, Clara? Wanna see 
                         if we can get a table?

                                     CLARA
                         All right.

               They turn and move toward the booths.

               BALLROOM.

               The dance floor is fairly dark. A romantic effect is achieved 
               by papier-mâché over the chandeliers. Around the walls are 
               the stag lines -- the MEN and waiting GIRLS. They stand singly 
               or in small uneasy groups. There is constant flux and 
               movement.

               CAMERA DOLLIES slowly past the stag line, moving past faces, 
               short, fat, tall, thin stags. Some pretend indifference. 
               Some exhibit patent hunger.

               CAMERA HOLDS ANGLING to include Marty, Angie near the end of 
               the stag line. They are freshly shaved and groomed.

               MARTY AND ANGIE.

               They are leaning against the wall smoking, watching their 
               more fortunate brethren on the floor in the background.

                                     ANGIE
                         Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?

                                     MARTY
                         There was one nice-looking one there 
                         inna black dress and beads, but she's 
                         dancing now.

                                     ANGIE
                              (looking off-screen)
                         There's a nice-looking little short 
                         one for you right now.

                                     MARTY
                              (following his gaze)
                         Where?

                                     ANGIE
                         Down there. That little one there.

               REVERSE ANGLE PAST Marty and Angie across the dance floor 
               toward the wall opposite, where three GIRLS are standing. 
               Two are leaning against the wall. The third is facing them 
               with her back to the dance floor. This last girl is the one 
               Angie has in mind. She is a cute little kid about twenty and 
               wears a bright smile.

               MARTY AND ANGIE.

               They stare off toward the three girls across the room.

                                     MARTY
                         Yeah, she looks all right from here.

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask 
                         them? I'll take the one inna green 
                         dress.

                                     MARTY
                         I think this number is a little fast. 
                         Wait a minute.

               He tries a few tentative steps, testing for tempo.

                                     MARTY
                         It's all right, I think. They still 
                         there?

               The two cavaliers turn their heads and look off-screen in 
               the direction of the three girls. Apparently, the girls are 
               still there. Marty and Angie relinquish their lounging 
               positions against the wall and slouch along past the line of 
               stags with a show of determined unconcern. They edge through 
               the crush of people on the non-dancing margin of the dance 
               floor and slowly push their way toward the...

               THREE GIRLS.

               Marty and Angie come in and start to approach the three girls. 
               The girls, aware of the boys' presence, stiffen and their 
               chatter comes to a halt. Angie advances to one of the girls.

                                     ANGIE
                         Waddaya say, you wanna dance?

               The girl looks surprised, as if this were an extraordinary 
               invitation to receive in a dance hall, looks confounded at 
               her two friends, shrugs, detaches herself from the wall, 
               moves to the outer fringe of the pack of dancers, raises her 
               hand languidly to dancing position and awaits Angie with 
               ineffable boredom. Marty, smiling tentatively, addresses the 
               SHORT GIRL.

                                     MARTY
                         Excuse me, would you care for this 
                         dance?

               The Short Girl gives Marty a quick glance of appraisal, then 
               looks quickly at her remaining friend.

                                     SHORT GIRL
                              (but not unpleasantly)
                         I don't feel like dancing just yet.

                                     MARTY
                         Sure.

               He turns and heads sluggishly in the direction of the stag 
               line.

               THE STAG LINE.

               A TRAVEL SHOT follows Marty, as he moves past the line of 
               stags, all of whom are watching him. CAMERA HOLDS as he finds 
               his old niche by the wall, leans there. A moment later, he 
               glances guardedly down to where the short girl and her friend 
               are.

               MARTY'S P.O.V.: The Short Girl is approached by a dapper 
               young BOY who asks her to dance. She smiles, excuses herself 
               to her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance floor.

               Marty stares at the Short Girl. He shrugs, he's used to this 
               kind of thing, then turns his attention bleakly back to 
               watching...

               THE DANCE FLOOR.

               The band starts up again and the MUSIC blares. It's a Lindy 
               Hop number. Couples swirl past; the MUSIC comes up BIG.

               THE BALLROOM.

               Marty leans against the wall, smoking and watching the dancers 
               swirl past. Dr. Keegan's VOICE is heard.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                              (off-screen)
                         You here stag or with a girl?

               Marty's attention is on the passing couples, so he doesn't 
               seem to hear. ANGLE WIDENS to include the Doctor standing on 
               Marty's right. Suddenly aware of the Doctor, Marty turns his 
               head.

                                     MARTY
                         You say something?

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Yeah. I was just asking you if you 
                         was here stag or with a girl.

                                     MARTY
                         I'm stag.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on 
                         a blind date with a dog, and I just 
                         met an old girl I used to know, and 
                         I was wondering how I'm gonna get 
                         rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody 
                         to take her home, you know what I 
                         mean? I'd be glad to pay you five 
                         bucks if you take her home for me.

                                     MARTY
                              (confused)
                         What?

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         I'll take you over, and I'll introduce 
                         you as an old army buddy of mine, 
                         and then I'll cut out. Because I got 
                         this other girl waiting for me out 
                         by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you 
                         five bucks.

                                     MARTY
                              (stares at the man)
                         Are you kidding?

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         No, I'm not kidding.

                                     MARTY
                         You can't just walk off onna girl 
                         like that.

               Dr. Keegan shrugs, moves down the line of stag guys. Marty 
               turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition. 
               The Doctor approaches THREE STAGS and obviously broaches the 
               subject with one of them. This STAG seems more receptive to 
               the idea. Dr. Keegan takes out a wallet and gives the Stag a 
               five dollar bill. The Stag detaches himself from the wall 
               and, a little ill-at-ease, follows the Doctor.

               Marty stands against the wall, watching the Doctor and the 
               Stag, who come in and move past him. Concerned and curious, 
               Marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning 
               position, following in their general direction.

               Marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the 
               area around the dance floor.

               ALCOVE NEAR ARCHWAY.

               As Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor 
               proper from the lounge, he pauses and looks off toward the 
               booths.

               LOUNGE.

               Clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths. Dr. 
               Keegan and the Stag stand over her, talking to her. She is 
               looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a Coca Cola 
               glass. Dr. Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to Clara 
               and is going through some story about being called away on 
               an emergency. The Stag is presented as her escort-to-be, who 
               will see to it that she gets home safely.

               Clara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying 
               hard not to seem affected. She politely rejects the Stag's 
               company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway. 
               Dr. Keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and 
               the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway.

               ARCHWAY.

               From where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr. 
               Keegan and the Stag. The Doctor and the Stag start past Marty, 
               and he catches their conversation.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         ...in that case, as long as she's 
                         going home alone, give me the five 
                         bucks back...

                                     STAG
                         Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks. 
                         I was willing. It's my five bucks...

               They move past and away and Marty stares after them before 
               he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen.

               Clara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the 
               glass of Coca Cola in front of her. Her eyes are closed. 
               Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out 
               of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next 
               to do. As she glances around, CAMERA ANGLES to include a 
               sign over an exit that reads "Fire Escape." Clara starts 
               moving toward that door.

               Marty is staring off-screen toward Clara. He slowly works 
               his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction 
               of the fire escape.

               LOUNGE.

               Near the entrance to the fire escape, Clara comes into view. 
               Background sounds continue steadily.

               Marty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops 
               and stares off-screen.

               Clara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape 
               outside.

               Marty watches. Then he continues on, crossing the threshold 
               of the...

               FIRE ESCAPE.

               It is sizeable, almost a small balcony. It looks out onto 
               the backs of innumerable five-story apartment houses. Clara 
               is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her 
               head sunk down. She is crying. Marty watches her for a moment 
               before moving a step or two forward.

               Clara doesn't turn. Marty tries to think of something to 
               say.

                                     MARTY
                              (finally)
                         Excuse me, Miss, would you care to 
                         dance?

               Clara slowly turns to Marty, her face streaked with tears, 
               her lips trembling. Then, in one of those moments of 
               simultaneous impulse, she lurches to Marty with a sob, and 
               Marty takes her to him.

               They stand in an awkward embrace, Marty a little embarrassed, 
               looking back through the fire escape doors to the lounge, 
               wondering if anybody is seeing them. He reaches back with 
               one hand, and contrives, with some effort, to push one of 
               the heavy iron doors shut. He returns his hand around the 
               girl's shoulders. He stands stiffly, allowing her to cry on 
               his chest, as we...

               FADE OUT.

               FADE IN:

               BRONX APARTMENT HOUSE, STAIRWAY. NIGHT

               Mrs. Pilletti, in her hat and coat and carrying a purse, is 
               making her heavy way up the last few steps toward the landing. 
               She pauses to catch her breath on the landing. Then she moves 
               down the hallway to...

               ENTRANCE TO APARTMENT 4-B.

               Mrs. Pilletti rings the bell. The SOUND can be heard as she 
               waits. The door is opened by Virginia.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Hello, Aunt Theresa. Come in.

               Mrs. Pilletti enters the apartment.

               APARTMENT.

               Virginia closes the door after Mrs. Pilletti enters, and 
               they stand in a small narrow hallway, brightly lit. At the 
               far end to the right is the living room in the background.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (in a low voice as 
                              she pulls off her 
                              coat)
                         Is Catherine here?

               Virginia helps her with her coat.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (nods, keeping her 
                              voice low)
                         We didn't tell her anything yet. We 
                         thought that we'd leave it to you. 
                         We thought you'd put it like how you 
                         were lonely, and why don't she come 
                         to live with you. Because that way 
                         it looks like she's doing you a favor, 
                         insteada we're throwing her out, and 
                         it won't be so cruel on her. Do you 
                         want Tommy and me to stay here with 
                         you?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I think it be a better idea if you 
                         and Thomas go out, because otherwise 
                         she's gonna start a fight with you, 
                         and everybody's gonna be yelling.

               Thomas appears at the living room end of the foyer with an 
               anxious smile on his face.

                                     THOMAS
                         Hello, Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hello, Thomas.

                                     THOMAS
                         I just this minute got the baby to 
                         sleep.

               He comes down to Mrs. Pilletti and Virginia, lowers his voice 
               to a conspiratorial whisper.

                                     THOMAS
                         Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way 
                         to ask her is you say that you're 
                         very lonely, see? And wouldn't she 
                         come and keep you company, because 
                         that way, you see...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a 
                         the whole thing.

               A shrill, imperious woman's voice breaks into the whispered 
               conference in the hallway.

                                     CATHERINE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Who's there?! Who's there?!

               Mrs. Pilletti heads up the foyer to the living room, followed 
               by Virginia and Thomas.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (calling back)
                         It's me, Catherine! How you feel?

               CATHERINE comes in at the end of the foyer. She is a gaunt 
               woman with a face carved out of granite. She is tough, 
               embittered, with a history of pain and mirthless hard work 
               ingrained into her features.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Hey! What are you doing here?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I came to see you. How you feel?

               The two sisters quickly embrace and release each other.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I gotta pain in my left side, and my 
                         leg throbs like a drum.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I been getting a pain in my shoulder.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I 
                         have a pain in my hip, and my right 
                         arm aches so much I can't sleep. 
                         It's a curse to be old. How you feel?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I feel fine.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's nice.

               Now that the standard greetings are over, Aunt Catherine 
               abruptly turns and goes back into the living room. Mrs. 
               Pilletti follows. Virginia and Thomas remain in the doorway.

               LIVING ROOM.

               Catherine and Mrs. Pilletti enter and Catherine heads straight 
               to a chair -- obviously her chair. It is an old heavy oaken 
               chair with thick armrests. The rest of the apartment is 
               furnished in what is known as "modern." A piece from House 
               Beautiful here, a piece from American Homes and Gardens there. 
               Aunt Catherine sits erect and forbidding in her chair. Mrs. 
               Pilletti seats herself with a sigh in a neighboring chair. 
               Thomas and Virginia remain off-screen in the hallway for a 
               moment to hang up Mrs. Pilletti's coat. The two old sisters 
               sit for a moment.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, how's everything with you?

               Aunt Catherine grimaces to describe how everything is with 
               her.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         My son Marty's fine. Everybody's 
                         fine...

               Thomas comes in from the hallway, stands in the back of the 
               room, somewhat apprehensively.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         We gotta postcard from my son Nickie 
                         and his bride. They're inna big hotel 
                         in Florida on their honeymoon. 
                         Everything is very nice.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's nice. I gotta letter from my 
                         husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His 
                         mother died.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Oh.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, 
                         owned the tavern in Abruzzi?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I don't think I remember him.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Well, he died. You know who else 
                         died?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Who?

                                     CATHERINE
                         You know the old man upstairs in 
                         this house. Old Irishman, always 
                         drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna 
                         hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, I always like to visit you, 
                         Catherine, because you always got 
                         such cheerful news.

               Virginia comes into the living room with Thomas. They remain 
               in the background.

                                     THOMAS
                              (suddenly)
                         Ma, you want something to eat, some 
                         tuna fish?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hey, why don't you go to the movie? 
                         Your mother and me, we're gonna be 
                         baby-sitter.

               Thomas looks indecisively at his wife.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' 
                         apartment. They told us to come down.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure, sure.

               Thomas ponders a moment.

                                     THOMAS
                         All right, Ma, we're going downstairs 
                         to the Kaplans, if you want us for 
                         anything.

               They exit. The two old sisters sit rigidly until they hear 
               the SOUND of the door closing. Catherine cocks an eyebrow 
               and promptly launches into her statement.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I wake up this morning, I hear the 
                         baby crying. So I wake up. I come in 
                         their room. That girl is shaking her 
                         hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! 
                         Don't you strike that baby! That's 
                         my son's baby!"

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         It's her baby too, you know.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's my son Thomas's baby.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, it ain't your baby.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Did I tell you she threw the bottle-
                         a milk at me?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You told me.

                                     CATHERINE
                         She's a witch, that one. I tell you 
                         what happen yesterday?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         What happen?

                                     CATHERINE
                         She gave me the evil eye.

               She demonstrates this by pulling the lower lid of one eye 
               down and staring grotesquely at the ceiling.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (scoffing)
                         Ufa!

                                     CATHERINE
                         I keep one eye open when I sleep, 
                         because she's gonna come in, stab me 
                         in my bed.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Catherine, I want you come live in 
                         my house with Marty and me.

               Her sister turns, genuinely surprised at this request.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Ah?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You son Thomas and Virginia, they 
                         come to my house this afternoon...

                                     CATHERINE
                              (sharply)
                         Who?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Your son Thomas and his wife 
                         Virginia...

                                     CATHERINE
                         When was this?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         This afternoon, about four, five 
                         o'clock.

                                     CATHERINE
                         What they say?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You know what they say. They say 
                         things are no good in this house. 
                         Catherine, your son is married. Leave 
                         him in peace. He wantsa be alone 
                         with his wife. They don't want no 
                         old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I 
                         tell you what I think. I want you 
                         come live with me in my house with 
                         Marty and me. In my house, you have 
                         your own room. You don't have to 
                         sleep onna couch inna living room 
                         like here. We will cook inna kitchen 
                         and talk like when we were girls. 
                         You are dear to me, and you are dear 
                         to Marty. We are pleased for you to 
                         come.

               Catherine surveys her sister coldly.

                                     CATHERINE
                         My son Thomas came to see you this 
                         afternoon, and he said to you he 
                         wants to cast his mother from his 
                         house?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Catherine, don't make an opera outta 
                         this. The three-a you anna baby live 
                         in three skinny rooms. You are an 
                         old goat, and she has an Italian 
                         temper. She is a good girl, but you 
                         drive her crazy. Catherine, you are 
                         no fool. You know this is no good, 
                         an old woman living with a husband 
                         and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, 
                         anna house burns down.

               Catherine stands abruptly. She is deeply hurt.

                                     CATHERINE
                         So I am an old garbage bag, put inna 
                         street.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a 
                         tragedy. You come to my house where 
                         you know you be happier yourself.

                                     CATHERINE
                         It pains that they should do this.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I know it pains.

               Catherine turns and meanders a few steps. The stiff edge of 
               mordant humor that has been her one defense against life has 
               deserted her, and she is just a hurt old lady now.

                                     CATHERINE
                         These are the worst years, I tell 
                         you.

               She seats herself on an Eames chair. On her right, a Modern-
               Age lamp towers slimly. On her left is a Modern-Age endtable 
               with a Modern-Age ashtray on it. The hardened muscles in her 
               face suddenly slacken.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (with deep compassion)
                         Catherine, you are very dear to me. 
                         We have cried many times together. 
                         When my husband died, I would have 
                         gone insane if it were not for you. 
                         I ask you to come to my house, because 
                         I can make you happy. Please come to 
                         my house.

                                     CATHERINE
                         These are the worst years. I tell 
                         you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm 
                         afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid 
                         I'm gonna see an old lady with white 
                         hair, like the old ladies inna park, 
                         little bundles inna black shawl, 
                         waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty-
                         six years old. What am I to do with 
                         myself? I have strength in my hands. 
                         I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna 
                         make dinner for my children. Am I an 
                         old dog to lie in fronta the fire 
                         til my eyes close? These are the 
                         terrible years, Theresa! Terrible 
                         years!

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Catherine, my sister...

               Catherine stares distraught at Mrs. Pilletti.

                                     CATHERINE
                         It's gonna happen to you! It's gonna 
                         happen to you! What will you do if 
                         Marty gets married?! What will you 
                         cook? What happen to alla children 
                         playing in alla rooms? Where is the 
                         noise?! It is a curse to be a widow! 
                         A curse. What will you do if Marty 
                         gets married?! What will you do?

               She stares at Mrs. Pilletti, her deep eyes haggard and pained. 
               Mrs. Pilletti stares back for a moment, then her own eyes 
               close. Catherine has hit home. Catherine sinks back onto her 
               chair, sitting stiffly, her arms on the thick armrests. Mrs. 
               Pilletti sits hunched a little forward, her hands folded 
               nervously in her lap.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (continuing quietly)
                         I will put my clothes inna bag, and 
                         I will come to you tomorrow.

               The two sisters, somber and silent, continue to just stare 
               at one another.

               THE STARDUST BALLROOM. NIGHT

               CAMERA PANS the crowd, picking up Marty and Clara dancing 
               cheek-to-cheek on the crowded, darkened dance floor. The 
               MUSIC rides over the top of the scene.

                                     MARTY
                         You come up here often?

                                     CLARA
                         I was up here twice before. Once 
                         with a friend of mine and once I 
                         came up alone. The last time... do 
                         you see that girl in the gray dress 
                         sitting over there?

                                     MARTY
                         Yeah.

                                     CLARA
                         Well, the last time I was up here, 
                         that's where I sat. I sat there for 
                         an hour and a half, without moving a 
                         muscle. Now and then, some fellow 
                         would sort of walk up to me and then 
                         change his mind. I'll never forget 
                         just sitting there for an hour and a 
                         half with my hands in my lap. Then I 
                         began to cry, and I had to get up 
                         and go home.

                                     MARTY
                         I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.

                                     CLARA
                         This is something recent with me, 
                         this bursting into tears at the least 
                         thing.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, I cry all the time, any little 
                         thing. My brothers, my brother-in-
                         laws, they're always telling me what 
                         a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you 
                         don't get goodhearted by accident. 
                         You get kicked around long enough, 
                         you get to be a real professor of 
                         pain. I know exactly how you feel. 
                         And I also want you to know I'm having 
                         a very good time with you now and 
                         really enjoying myself. So you see, 
                         you're not such a dog as you think 
                         you are.

                                     CLARA
                         I'm having a very good time, too.

                                     MARTY
                         So there you are. So I guess I'm not 
                         such a dog as I think I am.

                                     CLARA
                         You're a very nice guy, and I don't 
                         know why some girl hasn't grabbed 
                         you off long ago.

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know either. I think I'm a 
                         very nice guy. I also think I'm a 
                         pretty smart guy in my own way.

               Clara smiles briefly at this.

                                     MARTY
                         Now I figure, two people get married, 
                         and they gonna live together forty, 
                         fifty years. So it's just gotta be 
                         more than whether they're good looking 
                         or not. You tell me you think you're 
                         not very good-looking. My father was 
                         a really ugly man, but my mother 
                         adored him. She told me that she 
                         used to get so miserable sometimes, 
                         like everybody, you know? And she 
                         says my father always tried to 
                         understand. I used to see them 
                         sometimes when I was a kid, sitting 
                         in the living room, talking and 
                         talking, and I used to adore my old 
                         man, because he was so kind. That's 
                         one of the most beautiful things I 
                         have in my life, the way my father 
                         and mother were. And my father was a 
                         real ugly man. So it doesn't matter 
                         if you look like a gorilla. So you 
                         see, dogs like us, we ain't such 
                         dogs as we think we are.

               They dance silently for a moment, cheeks pressed against 
               each other.

                                     CLARA
                         I'm twenty-nine years old. How old 
                         are you?

                                     MARTY
                         I'm thirty-four.

               BALLROOM, STAIRWAY.

               Marty and Clara are about halfway down the steps leading to 
               the street entrance to the ballroom. Clara has on a light 
               summer coat. Marty is about two steps ahead of her and has 
               to keep turning his head to talk to her. He is in an elevated 
               mood, intoxicated -- on a talking jag.

                                     MARTY
                         ...you teach chemistry? That's funny. 
                         Where? What school?

                                     CLARA
                         Benjamin Franklin High School.

                                     MARTY
                         Benjamin Franklin, where's that? 
                         Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt 
                         right up here on Fordham Road. It's 
                         right arounna corner from my house. 
                         I have a cousin who's a teacher. He 
                         teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. 
                         He was studying to be a Jesuit, but 
                         he gave it up after his first vows.

               He has reached the street landing and waits for Clara to 
               catch up with him. They stand in front of the glass doors 
               leading to the street.

               BALLROOM VESTIBULE. GLASS DOORS.

                                     MARTY
                              (prattling on)
                         I was pretty good in high school. I 
                         sound like a jerk now, but I was 
                         pretty good. I graduated with an 
                         eighty-two average. That ain't bad. 
                         I was accepted at City College. I 
                         filled out the application and 
                         everything, but my old man died, so 
                         I hadda go to work. My best class 
                         was German. That was my first 
                         language. Der, die, das -- des, der, 
                         des. There you are, I still 
                         remember...

               He pushes the glass door open to...

               THE STREET OUTSIDE THE STARDUST BALLROOM.

               As Marty and Clara emerge onto the sidewalk of West Farms 
               Square, they pause again.

               It is about nine o'clock, and the busy street is brightly 
               lit from the stores.

               PASSERSBY hurry on their way. The elevated subway RUMBLES 
               over-head intermittently.

                                     MARTY
                              (chattering on)
                         You know what I was good at in high 
                         school? I was good in Math. You know 
                         how long ago I graduated high school? 
                         June, nineteen-thirty-seven. Holy 
                         cow! June, nineteen-thirty-seven! 
                         What is that? Fifteen, seventeen 
                         years ago! Holy cow! Seventeen years 
                         ago! Is that right? Seventeen, that's 
                         right. Where did it all go? I'm 
                         getting old. I'm gonna be thirty-
                         five November eighth. Thirty-five. 
                         Wow. Time goes on, boy.

               He takes her arm, and they start walking.

                                     MARTY
                         Nineteen-thirty-seven... that's right. 
                         My old man died December, nineteen-
                         thirty-seven.

               SIDEWALK.

               MOVING SHOT as they stroll toward the corner of Jerome and 
               Burnside Avenues.

                                     MARTY
                         Two o'clock in the morning he died. 
                         The doorbell rings, and I knew 
                         something was wrong right away. 
                         Because my room is onna ground floor 
                         inna front, you see, and I got outta 
                         bed, and I answered the door...

               CAMERA HOLDS as Marty, caught in his story, stops and 
               continues intently.

                                     MARTY
                         There was Mr. Stern. He had a house 
                         down about a block from us. He moved 
                         out though. My old man, he used to 
                         play cards with him and some other 
                         old guys. He's a Jewish feller. So 
                         he said, "Is your mother home?" So I 
                         knew right away there was something 
                         wrong. I was only eighteen, exactly 
                         eighteen years old, just the month 
                         before. So I said, "Is something 
                         wrong, Mr. Stern?" I was in my 
                         pajamas, you know? So he said, "Marty, 
                         your father died." My father died 
                         right inna middle of playing cards, 
                         right at the table. He had a heart 
                         attack. He had low blood pressure, 
                         my old man. He used to faint a lot.

               Suddenly he looks at Clara, rather startled.

                                     MARTY
                         Boy, am I talking, I never talked so 
                         much in my life. Usually, everybody 
                         comes to me and tells me all their 
                         troubles. Well, I'm gonna shut up 
                         now, and I'm gonna let you get a 
                         word in...

               He takes her arm again, and they continue strolling toward 
               the corner intersection in silence.

                                     MARTY
                         Seventeen years ago. What I been 
                         doing with myself all that time?... 
                         Well, I'm talking again. I must be 
                         driving you crazy. Mosta the time 
                         I'm with a girl, I can't find a word 
                         to say. Well, I'm gonna shut up now. 
                         Because I'm not like this usually. 
                         Usually, I... well, here I go again.

               They reach the corner intersection. CAMERA HOLDS on Marty as 
               he pauses again. He stares at Clara, confused at his strange 
               loquacity.

                                     MARTY
                         I can't shut my mouth... I'm on a 
                         jag, for Pete's sake. You'd think I 
                         was loaded...

               Marty stares at Clara, absolutely aghast at his inability to 
               stop talking.

                                     MARTY
                         I can't stop talking! Isn't this 
                         stupid?!

               He stands there in the middle of the sidewalk with PEOPLE 
               moving past, back and forth. Marty continues to stare at 
               Clara, his broad face widened by a foolish, confused smile. 
               Clara regards him affectionately.

                                     MARTY
                              (with sudden sincerity)
                         You gotta real nice face, you know? 
                         It's really a nice face.

                                     CLARA
                         Thank you.

               They stroll along farther up the noisy, jangled, trafficked 
               Saturday night avenue.

               GRAND CONCOURSE LUNCHEONETTE. NIGHT.

               Once a candy store, now a soda fountain where booths have 
               been installed in the rear. One wall of the luncheonette in 
               front is covered with magazines from floor to ceiling. It is 
               a nice clean joint, brightly lit. Several CUSTOMERS are 
               occupying three of the four booths.

               BOOTH.

               They sit opposite each other in the booth. Each has a cup of 
               coffee. Marty is still talking, but now he is apparently 
               telling a story so funny that he can hardly get the words 
               out. The hilarity has communicated itself to Clara. Her eyes 
               are burning with suppressed laughter. Every now and then she 
               has to gasp to control the bubbly giggling inside of her.

                                     MARTY
                         ...so I'm inna kneeling position, 
                         and if you ever try shooting a BAR 
                         inna kneeling position, you know 
                         what I mean. I can't holda steady 
                         position. I'm wavering back and 
                         forth...

               He has to interrupt the narrative to control a seizure of 
               giggles. Clara wipes her eyes and catches her breath.

                                     MARTY
                         ...so the guy next to me, he's 
                         shooting from the prone position, 
                         and he's cross-eyed like I told you...

               He can't go on. He has to stop and cover his face with one 
               hand.

                                     MARTY
                         So just then...
                              (stops to control 
                              himself again)
                         ...so just then I hear five shots go 
                         off from the guy next to me...

               It's too much for him. He lets out a sudden guffaw and 
               instantly smothers it under shaking shoulders. Clara hides 
               her face in her hands and giggles desperately. Some of the 
               other people turn to look at them.

                                     MARTY
                         So my target goes down, and a minute 
                         later, the flag comes up. I got five 
                         bulls-eyes. This cross-eyed guy next 
                         to me, he shot five bulls-eyes into 
                         my target...

               He stares at the girl, spent from laughter.

                                     MARTY
                         ...so I said to the sergeant who was 
                         checking my score, "Pretty good, eh, 
                         Sarge? Five bulls-eyes? So this 
                         sergeant, he don't know what happened, 
                         he says, "Say, that's all right, 
                         Pilletti"...

               He closes his eyes, shakes his head.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, man. So that's what happened. 
                         That's how I got the reputation-a 
                         being the best shot inna whole 
                         battalion... oh, man...

               For a moment they seem to have controlled their laughter. 
               They sit, shaking their heads, studying their fingers on the 
               table in front of them. Then slowly, Marty begins to giggle 
               again. It communicates itself to Clara. In a moment they are 
               hiding their faces in their hands, their shoulders shivering 
               with laughter.

               STARDUST BALLROOM.

               CLOSE ON Angie. His eyes look slowly in every direction. 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK disclosing Angie standing on the fringe of 
               the dance floor, head arched high, looking at the crowded 
               dance floor. He starts back to the archway toward the lounge, 
               looking over his shoulder.

               ARCHWAY.

               Angie comes into the archway, throws one more glance over 
               his shoulder at the dance floor, then turns and enters the...

               LOUNGE.

               Angie walks down the length of the lounge, looking into the 
               booths and simultaneously at the PEOPLE moving back and forth 
               in the lounge. At the far end of the lounge, he turns and 
               comes back along the bar side, checking each face at the 
               bar.

               ANTEROOM.

               There are three young BUCKOES laying out their money for 
               admission. One of them calls to Angie.

                                     BUCKO
                         Anything good in there, Mac?

                                     ANGIE
                         A buncha dogs.

               He crosses to the Men's Room.

               MEN'S ROOM.

               Angie comes into a momentarily empty room. Angie goes the 
               full length of the white tiled room, past the wash bowls, 
               the long mirror, bending to look under the doors of the 
               stalls. Suddenly he calls out.

                                     ANGIE
                         Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty, you in here?!

               He waits for an answer...

               GRAND CONCOURSE LUNCHEONETTE.

               CLOSE ON Marty and Clara still in the booth, but two more 
               cups of coffee have been set down in front of each of them. 
               There are also two pie-plates. Clara has left half of her 
               pie. Also an empty pack of cigarettes, and another pack half-
               gone. They are both smoking. Marty is still talking, but the 
               mood is no longer laughter. A pensive, speculative hush has 
               fallen over them. They have been talking for hours, and they 
               have reached the stage where you start tearing designs in 
               the paper napkins.

                                     MARTY
                         ...When I got outta the army, Clara, 
                         I was lost. I didn't know what I 
                         wanted to do. I was twenny-five years 
                         old, what was I gonna do, go back to 
                         my old job, forty cents an hour. I 
                         thought maybe I go to college under 
                         the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? 
                         But I wouldn't graduate till I was 
                         twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, 
                         even if I made it in three years. 
                         And my brother Freddie wanted to get 
                         married, and I had three unmarried 
                         sisters -- in an Italian home, that's 
                         a terrible thing. And my kid brother 
                         Nickie, he's a one got married last 
                         week. So I just went to pieces. I 
                         used to walk inna streets till three, 
                         four o'clock inna mornings. My mother 
                         used to be so worried about me. My 
                         uncle Mario come over one time. He 
                         offered me a job driving his hack 
                         onna night shift. He got his own 
                         cab, you know. And God forgive me 
                         for what I'm gonna say now, but I 
                         used to thinka doing away with myself. 
                         I used to stand sometimes in the 
                         subway, and God forgive me what I'm 
                         going to say, I used to feel the 
                         tracks sucking me down under the 
                         wheels.

                                     CLARA
                              (deeply sympathetic)
                         Yes, I know.

                                     MARTY
                         I'm a Catholic, you know, and even 
                         to think about suicide is a terrible 
                         sin.

                                     CLARA
                         Yes, I know.

                                     MARTY
                         So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a 
                         frienda my father -- he offered me 
                         this job in his butcher shop, and 
                         everybody pleaded with me to take 
                         it. So that's what happened. I didn't 
                         wanna be a butcher.

                                     CLARA
                         There's nothing wrong with being a 
                         butcher.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant 
                         profession. It's in a lower social 
                         scale. People look down on butchers.

                                     CLARA
                         I don't.

               Marty looks quickly up at her, then back down.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa 
                         sell his shop now, because he and 
                         his wife are lonely, and they wanna 
                         move out to California in Los Angeles 
                         and live near their married daughter. 
                         Because she's always writing them to 
                         come out there. So it's a nice little 
                         shop. I handle his books for him, so 
                         I know he has a thirty-five percent 
                         markup which is not unreasonable, 
                         and he takes home net maybe a hundred, 
                         hundred and fifty bucks a week. The 
                         point is, of course, you gotta worry 
                         about the supermarkets. There's two 
                         inna neighborhood now, and there's 
                         an A&P coming in, at least that's 
                         the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade 
                         is strictly Italian, but the younger 
                         Italian girls, they get married, and 
                         they don't stick to the old Italian 
                         dishes so much. I mean, you gotta 
                         take that into account too.

                                     CLARA
                         It's my feeling that you really want 
                         to buy this shop, Marty.

                                     MARTY
                         That's true. I do. But I'm gonna 
                         have to take outta loan inna bank 
                         eight thousand dollars. That's a big 
                         note to carry, because I have to 
                         give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and 
                         what I have to weigh is: will it pay 
                         off in the end more than I can make 
                         onna salary?

               Clara looks down at her fingers, her face alive and sensitive. 
               She carefully assembles her words in her mind. Then she looks 
               at the squat butcher across the table from her.

                                     CLARA
                         Marty, I know you for three hours, 
                         but I know you're a good butcher. 
                         You're an intelligent, sensitive, 
                         decent man. I have a feeling about 
                         you like sometimes a kid comes in to 
                         see me for one reason or another. 
                         And some of these kids, Marty, in my 
                         classes, they have so much warmth in 
                         them, so much capacity. And that's 
                         the feeling I get about you.

               Marty shuts his eyes, then opens them quickly, bows his head.

                                     CLARA
                         If you were one of my students, I 
                         would say, "Go ahead and buy the 
                         butcher shop. You're a good butcher."

               Clara pauses.

                                     MARTY
                              (not quite trusting 
                              the timbre of his 
                              voice)
                         Well, there's a lotta things I could 
                         do with this shop. I could organize 
                         my own supermarket. Get a buncha 
                         neighborhood merchants together. 
                         That's what a lotta them are doing.

               He looks up at her now.

                                     MARTY
                         Wadda you think?

                                     CLARA
                         I think anything you want to do, 
                         you'll do well.

               Tears begin to flood his eyes again. He quickly looks away. 
               He licks his lips.

                                     MARTY
                              (still looking down)
                         I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?

               Clara looks down at her hands.

                                     CLARA
                              (also in a low voice)
                         Yes, I am.

               Marty looks up at her.

                                     MARTY
                         I only got about three bucks on me 
                         now, but I just live about eight 
                         blocks from here on the other side 
                         of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk 
                         back to my house? I'll run in, pick 
                         up some dough, and let's step out 
                         somewhere.

                                     CLARA
                         I really should get home...

               She twists in her seat and looks toward the back of the 
               luncheonette.

                                     MARTY
                         It's only a quarter of twelve. The 
                         clock's right over there.

                                     CLARA
                         I really should get home, I told my 
                         father... Well, I suppose a little 
                         while longer. I wonder if there's 
                         any place around here I could put 
                         some makeup on...

               Marty considers this problem for a second, then leans out of 
               the booth and calls out.

                                     MARTY
                         Hey, Mac!

               CAMERA ANGLES to include the PROPRIETOR of the luncheonette. 
               He is sitting in one of the booths ahead reading the Sunday 
               Mirror. He looks up toward Marty.

                                     MARTY
                         You gotta Ladies' Room around here?

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Inna back.

                                     MARTY
                              (to Clara)
                         Inna back.

               Clara smiles at this innocent gaucherie, then edges out of 
               the booth, taking her purse with her.

               187TH STREET. NIGHT.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Angie meandering down the street on which 
               the neighborhood bar is located. It is near midnight, and 
               the street is empty except for Angie and the CLACKING of his 
               leather heels on the pavement. He comes to the bar, opens 
               the door, enters...

               THE BAR. NIGHT.

               The SOUNDS of Saturday night revelry are loud, coming mostly 
               from the Irish contingent of the neighborhood. They are 
               grouped along practically the whole bar. Three or four WOMEN 
               and a number of shirtsleeved MEN, mostly in their late 
               forties, early fifties. We know they're Irish, because one 
               of the younger men is chanting an auld country ballad.

               CAMERA ANGLES disclose the entrance to the bar in the 
               background, showing Angie coming in, looking here and there. 
               He starts toward the bar.

               NEAR BAR.

               TWO IRISH WOMEN, middle-aged, squat heavily on bar stools 
               over their schooners of beer, gassing away at each other.

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         ...so she told me that the doctor 
                         told her that if she had any more 
                         babies, she would do so at the risk 
                         of her life...

               Angie shuffles in, pausing near the bar and standing behind 
               the two Irish women.

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         She was always a bit thin in the 
                         hips...

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         Well, at the time she told me this, 
                         she already had six. Every time I 
                         saw the woman, she was either...

                                     ANGIE
                         Hey, Lou!

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         ...going to the hospital or coming 
                         from it. She was hatching them out 
                         like eggs.

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         And that husband of hers is a skinny 
                         bit of a fellow, isn't he?

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         Well, I bumped into her on the street, 
                         and she was as big as a barrel.

                                     ANGIE
                              (loudly)
                         Hey, Lou!

                         What?

                              Bartender)
                         Marty been in here the last coupla 
                         hours or so?

                         "...Mary, for heaven's sakes, didn't 
                         you tell me that another one'll kill 
                         you?"

                         I ain't seen Marty all night...

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         And her husband is a little bit of a 
                         man, isn't he?

                                     ANGIE
                              (calling to the 
                              Bartender, but even

                         Well, last week Tuesday, she gave 
                         birth to the baby in Saint Elizabeth's 
                         hospital... a big healthy boy of 
                         nine pounds...

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was 
                         wrong, wasn't he?

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         Oh, no! She died right in the 
                         hospital...

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         Oh, that's a sad story. And her 
                         husband is that little fellow, works 
                         in Peter Reeves.

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         That's the one.

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         Oh, that's a sad story.

               Angie has nothing better to do than give his attention to 
               the last lines of the story. Perturbed, he turns and leaves.

               NEAR ELEVATED SUBWAY. NIGHT.

               With street NOISES over the scene, Marty and Clara walk along 
               through the intricate understructure of the elevated subway 
               toward Webster Avenue.

               STREET.

               Marty and Clara walk slowly along a side street in Marty's 
               neighborhood. The streets are almost empty; perhaps an 
               occasional PEDESTRIAN on the other side of the street. The 
               cars are parked bumper-to-bumper in lines along the curb. 
               The five-story apartment buildings are mostly dark, an 
               occasional window lit.

               Marty suddenly stops and bends down; his shoe lace has become 
               untied. Clara sits back against the fender of the nearest 
               car and continues talking.

                                     CLARA
                         ...It's really a fine opportunity 
                         for me. But I'm not sure I want to 
                         be a department head. It's mostly 
                         executive and administrative work. 
                         Well, anyway, I told you about my 
                         father, and he depends on me a great 
                         deal, and...

                                     MARTY
                              (still concentrating 
                              on his shoelace)
                         Why don't you just move out to 
                         Portchester?

                                     CLARA
                         Well, that's what I was saying. My 
                         father is getting old. And we're 
                         very close. He's a wonderful man, 
                         really...

               She pauses as he straightens. He looks at her a moment.

                                     MARTY
                         I think you're kidding yourself, 
                         Clara. I used to think about moving 
                         out, you know? And that's what I 
                         used to say. "My mother needs me." 
                         But when you really get down to it, 
                         that ain't it at all. Actually, you 
                         need your father. You know what I 
                         mean? You're living at home, and you 
                         got your father and mother there, 
                         and you can go on like that -- being 
                         a little girl all your life.

                                     CLARA
                         I'm afraid of being lonely.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll 
                         make friends right away.

                                     CLARA
                         Actually, I don't make friends easily.

                                     MARTY
                         What're you talking about? You're a 
                         real likeable person. You'll make 
                         friends out there in Portchester 
                         one, two, three. You'll have people 
                         visiting you alla time. I'll come 
                         visit you. I'll borrow my brother 
                         Freddie's car, or you can call me up 
                         when you feel blue, or I'll call you 
                         up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be 
                         so afraid.

               They have only gone a few paces farther when Marty's shoelace 
               comes loose again. He fidgets self-consciously, bends down 
               and begins to retie it. The VOICE of Ralph, the well-dressed 
               man, established previously, is heard.

                                     RALPH'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Hey, Marty!

               Marty and Clara both look off...

               STREET. CAR WINDOW.

               Ralph is leaning out the car window twisting to look back up 
               the street.

                                     RALPH
                              (yelling)
                         Hey, Marty!

               Marty and Clara look around to find the source of the voice.

                                     RALPH
                         Marty! Over here!

               Marty and Clara again look around trying to find Ralph. Marty 
               spots him leaning out of the window of a '47 Chevy parked in 
               the background.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Ralph.

                                     RALPH
                              (yelling)
                         Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.

               Marty and Clara start walking toward the Chevy.

               INSIDE THE CHEVY.

               Ralph and MABEL, a young woman in her early thirties, are 
               seated in front. In the rear seat of the car, LEO is 
               sandwiched in between a MISS LOUISE KELLY and a MISS ELAINE 
               RITCHIE.

                                     RALPH
                              (explaining to girls)
                         You'll like this guy. This guy's a 
                         nice guy.

                                     LEO
                         Who's this? Marty?

                                     RALPH
                         Yeah.

                                     LEO
                              (confirming Ralph's 
                              statement)
                         Oh, this guy's a nice guy.

               STREET.

               Marty stops and excuses himself from Clara to walk slowly 
               toward the Chevy. It's about five cars down from him. The 
               camera pans with him.

               OUTSIDE THE CHEVY.

               Ralph is leaning out of the window again, watching Marty 
               approach.

                                     MARTY
                              (approaching the car)
                         Hello, Ralph, what's new?
                              (looks through the 
                              back window, 
                              recognizes Leo)
                         Hiya, Leo.

                                     LEO
                         Hiya, Marty.

                                     RALPH
                              (indicates with his 
                              head that he wishes 
                              to hold a whispered 
                              conference with Marty)
                         Hey, Marty, come here a minute.

               Marty leans with his elbow on the open front window of the 
               car, his head bowed, waiting for Ralph to speak his piece. 
               He studiously avoids looking at the girls in the car.

                                     RALPH
                              (lowering his voice)
                         Hey, Marty, we got an odd squirrel 
                         here, you interested?

               Marty allows his eyes to flicker quickly over the girl in 
               the seat next to Ralph.

                                     MARTY
                         Waddaya mean, Ralph?

                                     RALPH
                              (turning his head 
                              toward the rear of 
                              the car and raising 
                              his voice)
                         Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty 
                         Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, 
                         inna back seat there.

                                     MARTY
                         Hiya.

               Louise, not an unattractive girl by any means, is a little 
               surly at the moment. She merely nods at the introduction.

                                     LOUISE
                         What are we going to do, just sit 
                         around here all night?

                                     RALPH
                              (addressing Marty's 
                              bowed head in a quick 
                              mutter)
                         Listen, Marty, these three squirrels 
                         are nurses. We're all going over 
                         Leo's house later because there's 
                         nobody there. These are the squirrels 
                         I told you about. Money inna bank, 
                         man. Wanna get inna car? She's a 
                         pretty nice-looking doll.

                                     MARTY
                         I'm with a girl, Ralph.

                                     RALPH
                         Get ridda her. This is money inna 
                         bank.

                                     MARTY
                         I can't do that, Ralph, because 
                         somebody already brushed her off 
                         once tonight.

                                     RALPH
                         This is a good deal here, Marty.

               Marty straightens, looks surreptitiously back to the corner 
               where Clara is standing.

               Clara stands alone on the corner. She is an angular, awkward, 
               plain girl. Marty brings his attention back around to Ralph 
               who is leaning out of the car window.

                                     MARTY
                              (bending down to Ralph)
                         I can't do it, Ralph. Thanks anyway.
                              (looks toward back 
                              seat)
                         Very nice to have met you all.

                                     LOUISE
                         Come on, let's get outta here.

                                     LEO
                         Hey, Ralph, we might as well get 
                         going.

               Ralph bends forward and starts the car.

                                     MARTY
                         I'll see you, Leo.

                                     LEO
                         I'll see you, Marty.

               Marty takes a step or two back from the car, and Ralph begins 
               the business of wheeling the car from out of its parking 
               place. The car backs and fills once or twice and eventually 
               clears and whisks into the street.

               Marty stands looking after the departing car, then slowly 
               turns and goes back up the sidewalk. He joins Clara and we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PILLETTI HOME, KITCHEN. NIGHT

               Marty and Clara come into the dark house. Nobody is home. 
               Marty and Clara's silhouettes block the doorway momentarily.

                                     MARTY
                         Wait a minute. Lemme find the light.

               He finds the lights. The kitchen is suddenly brightly lit. 
               The two of them stand squinting to adjust to the sudden glare.

                                     MARTY
                         I guess my mother ain't home yet. I 
                         figure my cousin Thomas and Virginia 
                         musta gone to the movies, so they 
                         won't get back till one o'clock at 
                         least.

               Clara advances into the kitchen, a little ill at ease, and 
               looks around. Marty closes the porch door.

                                     MARTY
                         This is the kitchen.

                                     CLARA
                         Yes, I know.

                                     MARTY
                         Come on inna dining room.

               He turns the light on as he enters. Clara follows him into 
               the...

               DINING ROOM.

                                     MARTY
                         Siddown, take off your coat. You 
                         want something to eat? We gotta whole 
                         half-chicken in the icebox.

                                     CLARA
                              (alighting tentatively 
                              on the edge of a 
                              chair)
                         No, thank you. I don't think I should 
                         stay very long.

                                     MARTY
                         Sure. Just take off your coat a 
                         minute.

               He helps her off with her coat. He remains behind her, looking 
               down at her. Conscious of his scrutiny, she sits 
               uncomfortably, breathing unevenly. Marty takes her coat into 
               the dark living room. Clara is patient but nervous. Marty 
               comes back, sits on another chair, and there is an awkward 
               silence.

                                     MARTY
                         So I was telling you, my kid brother 
                         Nickie got married last Sunday. That 
                         was a very nice affair. And they had 
                         this statue of some woman, and they 
                         had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. 
                         I never saw anything so grand in my 
                         life.
                              (the silence again 
                              falls between them.)
                         And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I 
                         know a good hunka steak when I see 
                         one. That was choice filet, right 
                         off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty 
                         a pound. Of course, if you wanna 
                         cheaper cut, get rib steak. That 
                         gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes 
                         to about a buck and a quarter a pound, 
                         if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make 
                         yourself comfortable. You're all 
                         tense.

                                     CLARA
                         Oh, I'm fine.

                                     MARTY
                         You want me to take you home, I'll 
                         take you home.

                                     CLARA
                         Maybe that would be a good idea.

               She stands. He stands. He's a little angry. He turns and 
               sullenly goes back to the living room for her coat. 
               Wordlessly, he begins to help her into the coat.

               Standing behind her, he puts his hands on her shoulders, 
               then suddenly seizes her, and begins kissing her on the neck. 
               As Marty holds Clara, kissing the back of her neck, the 
               dialogue drops to quick, hushed whispers.

                                     CLARA
                         No, Marty, please...

                                     MARTY
                         I like you. I like you. I been telling 
                         you all night, I like you...

                                     CLARA
                         Marty...

                                     MARTY
                         I just wanna kiss, that's all.

               He attempts to turn her face toward him. She resists.

                                     CLARA
                         No...

                                     MARTY
                         Please...

                                     CLARA
                         No...

                                     MARTY
                         Please...

                                     CLARA
                         Marty...

               He releases her and turns away violently.

                                     MARTY
                         All right! I'll take you home! All 
                         right!

               He marches a few paces away, deeply disturbed. He turns back 
               to her.

                                     MARTY
                         All I wanted was a lousy kiss! What 
                         do you think, I was gonna try 
                         something serious with my mother 
                         coming home any minute!? What am I, 
                         a leper or something?!

               He turns and goes into the living room to hide the flush of 
               hot tears threatening to fill his eyes. Clara is also on the 
               verge of tears.

                                     CLARA
                              (more to herself than 
                              to him)
                         I just didn't feel like it, that's 
                         all.

               Slowly, she moves to the archway leading to the living room. 
               CAMERA ANGLES to include the living room where Marty sits on 
               the couch with his hands in his lap, staring straight ahead. 
               The room is dark except for the slanted light coming from 
               the dining room.

               Clara goes to the couch and sits on the edge beside him. He 
               doesn't look at her.

               LIVING ROOM.

                                     MARTY
                         I'm old enough to know better. Comes 
                         New Year's Eve, everybody starts 
                         arranging parties, I'm the guy they 
                         gotta dig up a date for. Let me getta 
                         packa cigarettes, and I'll take you 
                         home.

               He starts to rise but instead sinks back onto the couch, 
               looking straight ahead. Clara looks at him, her face 
               peculiarly soft and compassionate.

                                     CLARA
                         I'd like to see you again. Very much. 
                         The reason I didn't let you kiss me 
                         was because I just didn't know how 
                         to handle the situation. You're the 
                         kindest man I ever met. The reason I 
                         tell you this is because I want to 
                         see you again very much. I know that 
                         when you take me home, I'm going to 
                         just lie on my bed and think about 
                         you. I want very much to see you 
                         again.

               Marty stares down at his hands.

                                     MARTY
                              (without looking over 
                              at her)
                         Waddaya doing tomorrow night?

                                     CLARA
                         Nothing.

                                     MARTY
                         I'll call you up tomorrow morning. 
                         Maybe, we'll go see a movie.

                                     CLARA
                         I'd like that very much.

                                     MARTY
                         The reason I can't be definite about 
                         it now is my Aunt Catherine is 
                         probably coming over tomorrow, and I 
                         may have to help out.

                                     CLARA
                         I'll wait for your call.

                                     MARTY
                         We better get started to your house, 
                         because the buses only run about one 
                         an hour now.

                                     CLARA
                         All right.

               She stands.

                                     MARTY
                         I'll just get a packa cigarettes.

               He rises and goes into his bedroom. CAMERA ANGLES to include 
               door to bedroom. Marty opens his bureau drawer and extracts 
               a pack of cigarettes. He comes back out and looks at Clara 
               for the first time. They start to walk to the dining room. 
               In the archway, Marty pauses and turns to her.

                                     MARTY
                         Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?

                                     CLARA
                         Nothing.

               They quietly slip into each other's arms and kiss. Slowly 
               their faces part, and Marty's head sinks down upon her 
               shoulder. He is crying, detectable from the slight shake of 
               his shoulders. The girl presses her cheek against the back 
               of his head. They stand. The SOUND of the kitchen door opening 
               splits them out of their embrace. A moment later Mrs. 
               Pilletti's voice is heard.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Hallo! Hallo! Marty?!

               She comes into the dining room, stops at the sight of Marty 
               and Clara.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hello, Marty, when you come home?

                                     MARTY
                         We just got here about fifteen minutes 
                         ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss 
                         Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New 
                         York University. She teaches chemistry 
                         in Benjamin Franklin High School.

               This seems to impress Mrs. Pilletti.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Siddown, siddown. You want some 
                         chicken? We got some chicken in the 
                         ice box.

                                     CLARA
                         No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going 
                         home. Thank you very much anyway.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, siddown a minute. I just come 
                         inna house. I'll take off my coat. 
                         Siddown a minute.

               Mrs. Pilletti pulls her coat off.

                                     MARTY
                         How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give 
                         you a ride?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (nodding)
                         Oh, it's a sad business.
                              (turning to Clara)
                         My sister, Catherine, she don't get 
                         along with her daughter-in-law, so 
                         she's gonna come live with us.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Oh, sure.
                              (to Clara)
                         Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her 
                         siddown.

                                     MARTY
                         Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.

               Clara smiles and sits. Mrs. Pilletti likewise seats herself, 
               holding her coat in her lap.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (to Marty)
                         Did you offer the young lady some 
                         fruit?

                                     MARTY
                         I offered her, Ma, she don't want 
                         nothing.

                                     CLARA
                         No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (to Clara with a sigh)
                         It's a very sad business, I tell 
                         you. A woman, fifty-six years old, 
                         all her life, she had her own home. 
                         Now she's just an old lady, sleeping 
                         on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's 
                         a curse to be a mother, I tell you. 
                         Your children grow up and then what 
                         is left for you to do? What is a 
                         mother's life but her children? It 
                         is a very cruel thing when your son 
                         has no place for you in his home.

                                     CLARA
                         Couldn't she find some sort of hobby 
                         to fill out her time?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hobby! What can she do? She cooks 
                         and she cleans. You gotta have a 
                         house to clean. You gotta have 
                         children to cook for. These are the 
                         terrible years for a woman, the 
                         terrible years.

                                     CLARA
                         You mustn't feel too harshly against 
                         her daughter-in-law. She also wants 
                         to have a house to clean and a family 
                         to cook for.

               Mrs. Pilletti darts a quick, sharp look at Clara. Then she 
               looks back to her own hands, which are beginning to twist 
               nervously.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You don't think my sister Catherine 
                         should live in her daughter-in-law's 
                         house?

                                     CLARA
                         Well, I don't know the people, of 
                         course, but as a rule, I don't think 
                         a mother-in-law should live with a 
                         young couple.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Where do you think a mother-in-law 
                         should go?

                                     CLARA
                         I don't think a mother should depend 
                         so much upon her children for her 
                         rewards in life.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, maybe that's what they teach 
                         you in New York University. In real 
                         life, it don't work out that way. 
                         You wait till you are a mother.

                                     CLARA
                         It's silly of me to argue about it. 
                         I don't know the people involved.

                                     MARTY
                         Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. 
                         It's getting late, and the buses 
                         only run about one an hour.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (standing)
                         Sure.

                                     CLARA
                              (standing)
                         It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. 
                         Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure.

               Marty and Clara move toward the kitchen.

                                     MARTY
                         All right, Ma. I'll be back in about 
                         an hour, an hour anna half.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure.

                                     CLARA
                         Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Goodnight.

               Marty and Clara go out through the kitchen. CAMERA STAYS on 
               Mrs. Pilletti, who stands expressionlessly by her chair, 
               staring after them. She remains there rigid even after the 
               kitchen door has OPENED and SHUT.

               FORDHAM ROAD. NIGHT

               The biggest intersection in the Bronx is near the Grand 
               Concourse at Fordham Road, which is the biggest boulevard. 
               Despite the hour, the sidewalks are crowded with PEOPLE. The 
               TRAFFIC is heavy with buses.

               We PICK UP Angie walking up Fordham Road just about to the 
               Grand Concourse. As he reaches the northeast corner of the 
               intersection and stands, waiting for the light to change, he 
               looks off-screen. Something captures his attention, and he 
               calls out.

                                     ANGIE
                         Hey!!

               STREET OUTSIDE A DEPARTMENT STORE.

               In front of Alexander's Department Store, the street is 
               crowded, and a bus queue waits for the downtown Concourse 
               bus. Marty and Clara are part of the queue.

                                     ANGIE
                              (starting toward Marty 
                              and Clara, shouting)
                         Hey!

               Angie starts into the street without waiting for the lights 
               to change. Impatiently, he has to wait until traffic stops 
               for the light.

                                     ANGIE
                              (shouting as he goes)
                         Hey, Marty! Hey!

               Marty and Clara still stand, seeming not to hear Angie.

                                     ANGIE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Hey, Marty! Marty!

               Marty and Clara turn and stare off-screen.

               Angie pushes his way through the CROWD on the sidewalk and 
               manages to join Marty and Clara.

                                     ANGIE
                         Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I 
                         been looking all over for you.

                                     MARTY
                         I looked for you, Angie, before I 
                         cut out, but I couldn't find you.

                                     ANGIE
                         I been looking all over for you!

               Angie is absolutely unaware of, or simply refuses to 
               acknowledge the presence of the girl. He has pushed himself 
               in between Marty and Clara, and addresses himself entirely 
               to Marty.

                                     MARTY
                         What happened, Angie, was that we 
                         thought we were just gonna go for a 
                         short walk, and then we thought we 
                         were gonna come right back, but we 
                         got to talking. Listen, Angie, I 
                         want you to meet Clara...
                              (he tries to turn the 
                              sullen Angie toward 
                              Clara)
                         Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. 
                         I told you about him.

                                     CLARA
                         How do you do?

               Angie acknowledges the introduction with a surly nod.

                                     ANGIE
                              (completely ignoring 
                              Clara now)
                         Waddaya gonna do now?

                                     MARTY
                         I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close 
                         to one.

                                     ANGIE
                         You want me to ride down with you?

                                     MARTY
                         What for?

                                     ANGIE
                         It's early.

                                     MARTY
                         It must be one o'clock.

                                     ANGIE
                         It's Saturday night! There's still 
                         plenty-a action around!

                                     MARTY
                         Angie, by the time I get Clara home, 
                         it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By 
                         the time I get home, it's gonna be 
                         two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten 
                         o'clock mass tomorrow.

               Angie stares with thick, sullen jealousy at his best friend. 
               He turns sharply and starts away from Marty and Clara.

                                     ANGIE
                              (as he goes)
                         All right, I'll see you!

                                     MARTY
                              (calling after him)
                         Where you going?

               Angie, feeling rejected and jealous, moves swiftly out into 
               the other PEDESTRIANS on Fordham Road.

                                     MARTY
                              (calling more loudly 
                              after him)
                         I'll see you tomorrow after mass!

               He stares for a moment at the departing form of his friend, 
               then turns to Clara with a shrug and a smile, as if to say, 
               "I don't know what's the matter with him." The long-awaited 
               downtown bus ROARS up to the corner, blocking our view of 
               Marty and Clara.

               LOWER-MIDDLE-CLASS BRONX STREET. NIGHT.

               Marty and Clara stroll along the walk toward the front doors 
               of an apartment house.

               APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY. NIGHT.

               Marty and Clara enter and cross the lobby toward the stairway. 
               They move slowly.

                                     MARTY
                         You got an elevator in this house?

                                     CLARA
                         We just live one flight up.

                                     MARTY
                         So I'll call you tomorrow.

                                     CLARA
                         Okay.

               Clara leans against the iron banister of the stairway.

                                     CLARA
                         Call me about two-thirty, because I 
                         won't be home from my aunt's till 
                         about then.

               The doors of the ELEVATOR slide open, and a middle-aged COUPLE 
               comes out. They have obviously been having a heated exchange; 
               but at the sight of Marty and the girl at the stairway, they 
               become silent. They march across the lobby and out to the 
               street in repressed silence. The door CLANGS behind them.

               Marty and Clara have waited stiffly through this interruption, 
               and now they look at each other and smile.

                                     MARTY
                         Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night 
                         then.

                                     CLARA
                         Okay.

               Marty turns and moves across the lobby toward the street 
               door.

               OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT HOUSE.

               Marty stands a moment in the clear black night air, 
               expressionless, but within him, a strange exhilaration is 
               beginning to stir. He mosies away from the building along 
               the sidewalk, CAMERA panning with him.

               He strikes out suddenly with a spirited stride, as if he 
               knew where he was going.

               176TH STREET.

               CLOSER SHOT of Marty marching along 176th Street. He quickly 
               reaches the Grand Concourse. Here he pauses a moment, a little 
               at a loss for what direction to take -- then remembers he 
               needs the uptown bus.

               He moves across the wide street to get to the other side of 
               the boulevard. Again, he seems to lose track of which 
               direction is homeward.

               He walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride, pausing 
               every once in a while to see whether there's a bus coming.

               Suddenly Marty breaks into a dog-trot, then drops back into 
               the stiff stride as he approaches...

               THE INTERSECTION OF THE GRAND CONCOURSE.

               The corner near the bus stop is deserted. Marty stops, leans 
               against the pole of the bus stop sign.

               Abruptly, he turns and walks uptown a little further.

               SERIES OF INTERCUTS: Marty strides, walks, stops short, goes 
               to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves 
               back. The traffic moves by him. He stands in the wide street, 
               then with a gesture of magnificent expansiveness, he raises 
               his arm and calls out.

                                     MARTY
                         Taxi! Taxi! Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

               CLOSE-UP of Marty standing in the street, crying...

                                     MARTY
                         Taxi!... Taxi!...

               FADE OUT.

               PILLETTI HOME, MARTY'S BEDROOM. DAY

               Marty is in his trousers and T-shirt. He whistles as he 
               assembles his toilet articles for a shave. He starts out 
               toward the living room, still whistling. Bright sunlight 
               pours through the curtains on his window.

               SECOND FLOOR.

               Marty's whistling accompanies him to the second floor where 
               he turns into the bathroom. CAMERA ANGLES to include Mrs. 
               Pilletti's bedroom, disclosing her wearing an old faded 
               batiste kimona, puttering around her room and cleaning. As 
               Marty's toneless tune reaches her, Mrs. Pilletti turns her 
               head and stares off, listening.

               THOMAS AND VIRGINIA'S APARTMENT. DAY.

               Catherine, in the living room, is packing her meager but 
               neatly folded belongings into an old European carpet bag. 
               She has regained her stiff, mordant crustiness. The mild 
               WAIL of a baby can be heard.

               BEDROOM.

               The crowded bedroom is furnished in white modern. It is 
               cluttered by a baby's bassinet and other baby items. Virginia 
               sits on the edge of the bed, holding the baby, quieting it. 
               She is half-dressed, wearing her pajama top, a half-slip, no 
               stockings; her hair is still uncombed. Thomas slouches against 
               a chest of drawers, in morning semi-deshabille. He is 
               obviously sick with guilt. Virginia looks anxiously at her 
               husband then to the baby in her arms.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (heavy whisper)
                         Don't you think I feel lousy about 
                         this too?

                                     THOMAS
                         All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna 
                         talk anymore about it.
                              (sits on a wooden 
                              chair, unrolls a 
                              fresh pair of socks 
                              he's been holding)
                         I don't think I got one hour's sleep 
                         the whole night.
                              (raises one leg to 
                              put a sock on, pauses 
                              with his heel on the 
                              edge of his chair)
                         Last night was the first time in my 
                         life I ever heard my mother cry, you 
                         know that?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Tommy...

                                     THOMAS
                              (snapping)
                         I don't wanna talk about it!

               He pulls his sock on angrily, then lets his leg fall back to 
               the floor and just sits, one sock on, one sock in his hand. 
               He looks sullenly in the direction of his wife.

                                     THOMAS
                              (continuing, huffy)
                         I know what you're gonna say. A man's 
                         gotta stop being his mother's baby 
                         sooner or later. How many times you 
                         gonna say it? She's my mother, you 
                         know. I oughta have some feelings 
                         about her, don't you think?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Why do you always put me inna position 
                         of being the louse?

                                     THOMAS
                              (in a furious whisper)
                         Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more 
                         about it!

               He stands, then becomes aware he has to put on his other 
               sock. He sits down again and pulls the second sock on. 
               Virginia has had a hot reply in her mouth, but she forces it 
               back. She rocks the baby a little.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Tommy, I love you, and I know you 
                         feel lousy right now, but we're never 
                         gonna be happy unless we have a chance 
                         to work out our own lives. We can't 
                         keep talking in whispers like this 
                         the resta our lives. We gotta have 
                         some privacy. We...

               Thomas has risen, a slim, dark, unsettled young man in 
               undershirt and trousers, holding his shoes in one hand. He 
               starts toward the...

               FOYER.

               Thomas strides down the little foyer. He turns and looks 
               into the living room. He watches his mother packing strange 
               brown parcels into her bag.

                                     THOMAS
                              (scowling)
                         Can't you wait five minutes? I'll 
                         drive you over inna car. I just gotta 
                         put my shirt on, that's all.

               The old lady nods brusquely.

               LIVING ROOM.

               Thomas stands with his head bowed to hide the tears he feels 
               sweeping into his hot eyes. Then he returns to his bedroom 
               in his stocking-feet, carrying his shoes.

               BEDROOM.

               Thomas comes in just as Virginia bends over the bassinet, 
               having gotten the baby back to sleep. Thomas cries to her in 
               a furious whisper.

                                     THOMAS
                         All right, get dressed, because we're 
                         gonna drive my mother over. Why 
                         couldn't you get along with her?! 
                         Why couldn't you make just a little 
                         effort?! She's a little hard to get 
                         along with! All right! All I asked 
                         you was try a little.

               He turns from her, sits down on the bed miserably angry with 
               the world, his wife, his mother, himself. The baby begins to 
               whimper again. Virginia turns wearily to her husband.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Tommy...

                                     THOMAS
                              (roaring out)
                         I don't wanna hear anymore about it, 
                         you hear me?

               MARTY'S HOME, FRONT PORCH. DAY.

               A small procession consisting of Thomas carrying his mother's 
               carpet bag, his mother carrying small paper-wrapped bundles, 
               and Virginia holding the baby comes across the front hedge. 
               Thomas leads the parade with a muffled sorrow. They turn up 
               the porch to the front door. Virginia remains in the small 
               front yard. She is miserable.

               PILLETTI HOME, DINING ROOM. DAY.

               Mrs. Pilletti is dressed in hat and coat and all set to go 
               to mass. She is bent over the dining room table piling the 
               breakfast dishes and crumbing the table. She looks up as 
               Thomas comes in carrying his mother's bag. Aunt Catherine is 
               right behind him. Beyond the porch, we can see Virginia 
               walking the baby around outside.

                                     THOMAS
                         Hello, Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?

                                     THOMAS
                              (setting the bag down)
                         Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. 
                         I hadda beg her to let me drive her 
                         over here. The martyr. She always 
                         gotta be the big martyr.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Hey, will you go to mass, please. 
                         This one, he woke up this morning 
                         with salt in his nose. Do this! Do 
                         that! Will you leave me in peace, 
                         ah?

               A burst of spirited song soars from upstairs. Mrs. Pilletti, 
               Aunt Catherine and even Thomas pause to look up in the 
               direction of the voice.

               HALLWAY/STAIRWAY.

               Marty descends the stairs whistling. He carries his jacket 
               over his arm. He makes some final adjustments to his tie.

               DINING ROOM.

               Alert to Marty's mood, Mrs. Pilletti, Aunt Catherine and 
               Thomas stand, waiting for him to join them downstairs.

                                     MARTY
                              (ebulliently)
                         Hello, Aunt Catherine! How are you? 
                         Hello, Thomas. You going to mass 
                         with us?

                                     CATHERINE
                         I was at mass two hours ago.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, make yourself at home. The 
                         refrigerator is loaded with food. Go 
                         upstairs, take any room you want. 
                         Thomas, you going to mass with us?

                                     THOMAS
                              (nods)
                         Yeah, yeah, sure.

               He abruptly goes out into the living room and onto the front 
               porch.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (to Catherine)
                         You wanna cuppa coffee?

               Marty has followed Thomas out into the living room.

                                     MARTY
                         Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?

                                     THOMAS
                         Sure, great if you ain't married.

               Thomas goes out the door onto the porch. Marty stands in the 
               open doorway. He looks out into the warm sunshine in the 
               front yard.

                                     MARTY
                         Hi, Virginia.

               He goes out into the yard to Virginia. He is as gay as a 
               bird. He takes the baby from Virginia's arms, holds it high 
               up above him.

                                     MARTY
                              (to baby)
                         Hey, little boy, you sure getting 
                         fat. You weigh more than a side-a 
                         beef now.
                              (beams at the baby)
                         Hey, Thomas, so I was telling you 
                         yesterday you was over my house -- 
                         Mr. Gazzara, my boss, so he wantsa 
                         sell his shop, go out to California 
                         because his kids are all married, 
                         and he...

               Thomas hasn't been listening to Marty and crosses quickly to 
               Virginia.

                                     THOMAS
                         Wadda you so sore about?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?

               Marty comes up to them, holding the baby.

                                     MARTY
                         So Thomas, he does about twelve, 
                         thirteen hundred gross. Rent's a 
                         hundred and two. The problem, of 
                         course, is the supermarkets. That's 
                         what I wanna ask you. If I get 
                         together with a coupla other 
                         merchants, make our own supermarket...

               Thomas has been trying to listen to Marty, but his thoughts 
               are all with his own problem. He whirls on Virginia.

                                     THOMAS
                         What about the time she wanted to 
                         make an old-fashioned Italian dinner 
                         for my brother, but you wouldn't let 
                         her!?

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (with her own temper)
                         Waddaya talking about?!!

                                     THOMAS
                         Once a month you couldn't let her 
                         use the kitchen!

                                     VIRGINIA
                         I told her she could use the kitchen 
                         any time she wanted...

                                     THOMAS
                         ...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen 
                         alla time!

                                     VIRGINIA
                         She don't wanna use my pots and pans!

                                     MARTY
                         So Tommy...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Waddaya want me to do, go out and 
                         buy a whole new setta pots and pans?!

               The baby in Marty's arms has started to cry a little.

                                     MARTY
                         Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because 
                         I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him 
                         know tomorrow. See, what I wanna 
                         know, Tom, if a buncha individual 
                         retail merchants get together, how 
                         does it operate? On individual mark-
                         ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm 
                         the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's 
                         the dairyman and grocer, so suppose 
                         I mark up thirty-five percent, but 
                         he works on forty, so...

                                     THOMAS
                         Waddaya talking about, do you know 
                         what you're talking about?

                                     MARTY
                         No, I don't know. That's why I'm 
                         asking you.

               The baby starts to cry again. Thomas turns to his wife.

                                     THOMAS
                         Take the baby, will you?!

               Virginia hurries over and takes the crying baby from Marty's 
               arms, walks around comforting the child. Thomas turns back 
               to Marty.

                                     THOMAS
                         Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will 
                         you tell me? You gotta good job, you 
                         got no wife, you got no 
                         responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was 
                         you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself 
                         down with a shop? What's he want? 
                         Five thousand down? You're gonna 
                         have to carry a mortgage sixty, 
                         seventy bucks a month. A mortgage 
                         anna note from the bank. For Pete's 
                         sake, you're a single man with no 
                         responsibilities. Stay that way, 
                         boy. Take my advice.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, you see, Thomas I figure the 
                         big problem is the supermarkets. But 
                         Patsy's shop, that's a specialized 
                         trade. The supermarkets don't carry 
                         Italian meat.

                                     THOMAS
                         Who buys Italian meat anymore? You 
                         think my wife buys Italian meat?
                              (throws a baleful 
                              glance at his wife)
                         She goes to the A&P, picks up some 
                         lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, 
                         opens up a canna peas, and that's 
                         dinner, boy.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Sure, all you wanna eat is that greasy 
                         stuff your mother makes.

               Marty is a little taken aback by Thomas's frontal assault.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, I understand the problem about 
                         the supermarkets, but I was talking 
                         to this girl last night, and she 
                         made the point that a likeable 
                         personality is a valuable business 
                         asset.

                                     THOMAS
                         Marty, see that my mother is nice 
                         and comfortable, eh?

                                     MARTY
                         Sure. This girl said...

                                     THOMAS
                         What girl, what does she know?
                              (he whirls on his 
                              wife again)
                         Why don't you let her hold the baby 
                         once in a while?! Your mother, boy, 
                         she wantsa take the kid for a day, 
                         that's fine!

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (her temper flaring 
                              again)
                         Your mother handles the kid like he 
                         was a yoyo!

               Marty stands, watching the young couple yakking at each other. 
               The little baby starts to cry again.

               KITCHEN.

               The two old sisters sit at the kitchen table, two untouched 
               cups of coffee in front of them.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hey, I come home from your house 
                         last night, Marty was here with a 
                         girl.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Who?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Marty.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Your son Marty?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, what Marty you think is gonna 
                         be here in this house with a girl?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Were the lights on?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Oh sure.
                              (frowns at her sister)
                         This girl is a college graduate.

                                     CATHERINE
                         They're the worst. College girls are 
                         one step from the streets. They smoke 
                         like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, 
                         his wife, you know, she types onna 
                         typewriter. One step from the streets, 
                         I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders 
                         this philosophy for a moment.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         That's the first time Marty ever 
                         brought a girl to this house. She 
                         seems like a nice girl. I think he 
                         has a feeling for this girl. You 
                         heard him sing. He been singing like 
                         that all morning.

               Catherine nods bleakly.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Well, that's all. You will see. Today, 
                         tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say 
                         to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being 
                         a single man. I'm tired-a running 
                         around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, 
                         Ma, wadda we need this old house? 
                         Why don't we sell this old house, 
                         move into a nicer parta town? A nice 
                         little apartment?"

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I don't sell this house, I tell you 
                         that. This is my husband's house. I 
                         had six children in this house.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You will see. A coupla months, you 
                         gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna 
                         couch in her daughter-in-law's house.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. 
                         Wherever you are, the rain follows. 
                         Someday, you gonna smile, and we 
                         gonna declare a holiday.

               Marty comes in from the living room, a little down after his 
               session with Thomas and Virginia.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting 
                         a little late.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure.

               Marty goes to the sink to get himself a glass of water. He 
               examines a piece of plaster that has fallen from the ceiling.

                                     MARTY
                         Boy, this place is really coming to 
                         pieces.
                              (turning to his mother)
                         You know, Ma, I think we oughta sell 
                         this place. The whole joint's going 
                         to pieces. The plumbing is rusty. 
                         Everything. I'm gonna have to 
                         replaster the whole ceiling now. You 
                         know what we oughta do? We oughta 
                         get one of those new apartments 
                         they're building down on Southern 
                         Boulevard. A nicer parta town, you 
                         know?...You all set, Ma?

               Mrs. Pilletti exchanges a brief frightened glance with her 
               sister.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I'm all set.

               She sends another frightened look at her sister and follows 
               Marty out into the living room.

               MARTY'S PORCH.

               Marty, his mother, Thomas and Virginia with the baby file 
               down the porch to the street on their way to church. Marty 
               and his mother are both troubled. The anger has left both 
               Thomas and Virginia, but they are both silent. At the far 
               end of the alleyway, as they reach the street, Virginia puts 
               her free arm through her husband's elbow. Thomas looks briefly 
               at her and they exchange a look of commiseration. Everyone 
               turns and disappears off into the street.

               CHURCH.

               A HIGH, WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the church establishes that stage 
               of Sunday morning between the nine and ten o'clock masses. 
               People flock around the doors of the church.

               INSIDE THE CHURCH.

               The parishioners are making their ways to the door. A few 
               silent penitents still kneel here and there in the long empty 
               rows of pews. The large, almost empty church is filled now 
               with organ MUSIC.

               Both Marty and his mother seem a little depressed as they 
               stand at the doorway just inside the church, as the nine 
               o'clock mass people flow out, and the first of the ten o'clock 
               mass people file in.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         That was a nice girl last night, 
                         Marty.
                              (Marty nods)
                         She wasn't a very good-looking girl, 
                         but she looks like a nice girl.
                              (she pauses, Marty 
                              makes no reply)
                         I said, she wasn't a very good-looking 
                         girl... not very pretty...

                                     MARTY
                              (still amiable)
                         I heard you, Ma.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She looks a little old for you. About 
                         thirty-five, forty years old?

                                     MARTY
                         She's twenty-nine, Ma.

               A nearby kneeling penitent looks disapprovingly at Mrs. 
               Pilletti and shushes her. The mother nods briefly.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She's more than twenty-nine years 
                         old, Marty. That's what she tells 
                         you.

                                     MARTY
                         What, Ma?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She looks thirty-five, forty. She 
                         didn't look Italian to me.

               Marty frowns but remains silent.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I said, is she Italian girl?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know. I don't think so.

               It's Mrs. Pilletti's turn to frown. A silence. She turns 
               back to Marty.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She don't look Italian to me. What 
                         kinda family she come from? There 
                         was something about her I didn't 
                         like. It seems funny, the first time 
                         you meet her, she comes to your empty 
                         house alone. These college girls, 
                         they all one step fromma streets.

               Marty turns, on the verge of anger with his mother.

                                     MARTY
                         What are you talking about? She's a 
                         nice girl.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She didn't look Italian to me.

               A silence hangs between them.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I don't like her.

                                     MARTY
                         You don't like her. You only met her 
                         for two minutes.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Don't bring her to the house no more.

                                     MARTY
                         What didn't you like about her?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I don't know! She don't look like 
                         Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian 
                         girls around.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, let's not get inna fight about 
                         it, Ma.

               The kneeling woman shushes them again. By now the nine o'clock 
               worshipers have filed out, and Marty joins the flow of ten 
               o'clock people moving in. His mother turns back to him again.

                                     MARTY
                              (stopping her before 
                              she gets started)
                         What are you getting so worked up 
                         about? I just met the girl last night. 
                         I'm probably not gonna see her again.

               They continue down the aisle of the church.

               BAR. DAY.

               An hour later, the after-mass CROWD is there. It's a little 
               more crowded than weekdays. A WOMAN with a glass of beer in 
               one hand, rocks a baby carriage with the other.

               Marty enters the bar, moves along, ad-libbing "Hello" to 
               someone at the bar, gets the attention of Lou, the bartender.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?

                                     BARTENDER
                         He was here last night till about 
                         two o'clock. I hear you really got 
                         stuck with a dog last night.

                                     MARTY
                              (glancing quickly at 
                              him)
                         Who told you that?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Angie. He says she was a real scrawny-
                         looking thing.

                                     MARTY
                         She wasn't so bad.

               He turns away from the bar annoyed, notes Ralph, sitting 
               alone in one of the booths, reading the Sunday comics. Marty 
               ambles over to him.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out 
                         with those nurses last night, Ralph?

                                     RALPH
                              (looking up)
                         Oh man, you shoulda come with us 
                         last night, Marty. That one for you 
                         was a real lunatic. How'd you make 
                         out?

               The abruptness of the question rather startles Marty. It is 
               not an expression he would normally associate with an evening 
               with Clara.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, I hadda nice time...I didn't try 
                         nothing. She's a nice girl. I just 
                         met her last night, you know. I just 
                         talked with her. I didn't even try 
                         nothing...

               He feels very ill at ease and a little guilty for defending 
               himself.

                                     MARTY
                         Listen, you see Angie, tell him I 
                         went home, I'll meet him after lunch.

               He moves back down the bar and goes out into the street.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MARTY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM. AFTERNOON

               Marty is seated at the dining room table. He has removed his 
               jacket, tie and shirt, even his shoes, and is making himself 
               comfortable over a late Sunday lunch. With him are Angie and 
               Joe, the Critic. Lounging in a chair but not at the table is 
               Leo.

                                     JOE
                         ...so the whole book winds up, Mike 
                         Hammer, he's inna room there with 
                         this doll. So he says, "You rat, you 
                         are the murderer." So she begins to 
                         con him, you know? She tells him how 
                         she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots 
                         her in the stomach. So she's laying 
                         there, gasping for breath, and she 
                         says, "How could you do that?" And 
                         he says, "It was easy."

                              (without looking up 
                              from his magazine)
                         Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he 
                         can write.

               Angie reaches over to Marty's plate and filches a piece of 
               rissole, evidently annoying Marty.

                                     MARTY
                         We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We 
                         give you a plate-a your own.

                         Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother 
                         just stuffed me right up to the jaws.

               This doesn't prevent him from filching a second piece of 
               rissole.

                                     JOE
                         What I like about Mickey Spillane is 
                         he knows how to handle women. In one 
                         book, he picks up a tomato who gets 
                         hit with a car, and she throws a 
                         pass at him. And then he meets two 
                         beautiful twins, and they throw passes 
                         at him. And then he meets some 
                         beautiful society leader, and she 
                         throws a pass at him, and...

                         Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure

                         Listen, somebody turn onna ballgame. 
                         It must be after one o'clock by now.

               Marty looks down at his watch, then stands and starts for 
               the phone, sitting on a chest of drawers at the other end of 
               the room.

                                     ANGIE
                         Who you gonna call?

                                     MARTY
                         I was gonna call that girl from last 
                         night. Take her to a movie tonight.

                                     ANGIE
                         Are you kidding?

                                     MARTY
                         Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you 
                         were very impolite last night. I 
                         introduced you to the girl, you just 
                         turned and walked off. Now, why did 
                         you do that?

                                     ANGIE
                         You got me mad, that's why. Hey, 
                         Joe, show Marty that picture.

               Joe, having finished his dissertation on Mickey Spillane, is 
               now studying another girlie magazine. He proffers an opened 
               page to Marty, who stands over by the phone.

                                     MARTY
                         Put that away, for Pete's sake. My 
                         mother's right out onna porch.

                                     JOE
                         I wonder where they find those girls 
                         that pose for them pictures.

                                     LEO
                         Those are Hollywood starlets.

                                     MARTY
                         Put it away, Joe. My mother'll come 
                         walking in.

               Joe closes the magazine.

                                     ANGIE
                         Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second 
                         Street area tonight.

                                     MARTY
                         I don't feel like going, Angie. I 
                         thought I'd take this girl to a movie.

                                     ANGIE
                         Boy, you really musta made out good 
                         last night.

                                     MARTY
                         We just talked.

                                     ANGIE
                         Boy, she musta been some talker. She 
                         musta been about fifty years old.

                                     JOE
                         I always figure a guy oughta marry a 
                         girl who's twenny years younger than 
                         he is so that when he's forty, his 
                         wife is a real nice-looking doll.

                                     LEO
                         That means he'd have to marry the 
                         girl when she was one year old.

                                     JOE
                         I never thoughta that.

                                     MARTY
                         I didn't think she was so bad-looking.

                                     ANGIE
                         She musta kept you inna shadows all 
                         night.

                                     RALPH
                         Marty, you don't wanna hang around 
                         with dogs. It gives you a bad 
                         reputation.

                                     ANGIE
                         Let's go downa Seventy-Second Street.

                                     MARTY
                         I told this dog I was gonna call her 
                         today about two-thirty.

                                     ANGIE
                              (angry)
                         Brush her. Listen, you wanna come 
                         with me tonight, or you wanna go 
                         with this dog?

                                     MARTY
                         Waddaya getting so sore about?

                                     ANGIE
                         I looked all over for you last night, 
                         you know that?

               He turns away sulking. Marty doesn't pick up the phone but 
               returns to his seat, upset.

                                     JOE
                         Another book that I read by Mickey 
                         Spillane, I can't remember the name 
                         of it, but it was about this red-
                         headed tramp he finds inna street, 
                         and he gives her some dough, because 
                         he's sorry for her... Wait a minute, 
                         I think that's the same book I was 
                         telling you about before...

                                     MARTY
                              (to Angie)
                         You didn't like her at all?

                                     ANGIE
                         A nothing. A real nothing.

               Marty lowers his head. Over this, Joe's VOICE DRONES on.

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         You know something...?

               CAMERA ANGLE HOLDS on Marty looking down, as Joe's VOICE 
               continues.

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         ...I can't tell one-a those Mickey 
                         Spillane books from the other, but 
                         he's a real good writer, though...

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               SNYDER APARTMENT. NIGHT

               CLOSE ON television screen. Ed Sullivan is on, indicating 
               the time is a little after half past seven. CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK, disclosing Clara, Mr. and Mrs. Snyder in their living 
               room. Apparently the Sullivan show is very funny at the 
               moment, for the television audience roars with laughter. 
               CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON Clara. Another ROAR of LAUGHTER 
               from the television that Clara watches, although her eyes 
               are flooded with tears, several of which have already traced 
               wet paths down her cheeks. Another ROAR of laughter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PILLETTI HOME, DINING ROOM. NIGHT.

               Marty, Mrs. Pilletti and Catherine are eating silently at 
               the table. Catherine reads an Italian newspaper as she eats.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         So what are you gonna do tonight, 
                         Marty?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked 
                         out. I think I'll just hang arounna 
                         house and watch...

               Suddenly he pauses, sharply aware of the repetition in his 
               life. Mrs. Pilletti is also aware of it.

                                     MARTY
                         Maybe, I'll go out and see what Angie 
                         and the boys are doing...

               They eat silently a moment.

               187TH STREET. BAR. NIGHT.

               CLOSE-UP of Marty leaning against the wall in front of the 
               bar. A group of young men lounge about, killing time.

               Angie, Leo and Joe are among them. There are perhaps four or 
               five other young MEN, loosely divided into two groups. The 
               group that concerns us has Marty and the others mentioned 
               and GEORGE, a young man in a sport jacket.

                                     LEO
                         What time is it?

                                     JOE
                         About eight o'clock.

                                     ANGIE
                              (to George)
                         You don't feel like going downna 
                         Seventy-Second Street?

                                     GEORGE
                         It'll take an hour anna hour back, 
                         and the whole evening's gone.

                                     JOE
                         What's playing on Fordham Road? I 
                         think there's a good picture in the 
                         Loew's Paradise.

                                     GEORGE
                         You guys feel like working up a game-
                         a cards?

                                     ANGIE
                         Come on, let's go down Seventy-Second 
                         Street, walk around. We're sure to 
                         wind up with something.

               CLOSE-UP of Marty, his head down, his eyes closed. The group 
               continues their dialogue back and forth. Their VOICES can be 
               heard as Marty's head slowly comes up.

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         I'll never forgive LaGuardia for 
                         cutting out burlesque outta New York 
                         City...

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         There's a burlesque in Union City. 
                         Let's go over to Union City...

                                     ANGIE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Yeah, you're the one who don't even 
                         wanna take a ride onna subway for 
                         half an hour. Now, you wanna go alla 
                         way over to Union City...

                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         I feel like playing cards. I saw 
                         Richie Rizzo, that's what he said he 
                         felt like doing...

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         I don't feel like playing cards. 
                         Waddaya feel like doing tonight, 
                         Angie?

                                     ANGIE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         I don't know. Wadda you feel like 
                         doing?

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         I don't know, Angie. Wadda you feel 
                         like doing?

               A fury rises in Marty's face. He cries out at them.

                                     MARTY
                         "What are you doing tonight?"... "I 
                         don't know, what are you doing?!"...

               CAMERA ANGLES over to the others who, at this outburst, stare 
               at Marty astounded.

                                     MARTY
                              (continuing)
                         The burlesque! Loew's Paradise! 
                         Miserable and lonely! Miserable and 
                         lonely and stupid! What am I, crazy 
                         or something?! I got something good 
                         here! What am I hanging around with 
                         you guys for?!

               He has said this in tones so loud that it attracts the 
               attention of the few PEOPLE on the street. A little 
               embarrassed by the attention he's getting, he turns, opens 
               the door to the bar, and goes into it.

               After a stunned moment, Angie hurries after him.

               INSIDE THE BAR.

               Marty marches the length of the room toward the phone booths 
               in the rear. CAMERA ANGLES to disclose Angie right behind 
               him.

               Marty is about to enter one of the phone booths, but he stops 
               as Angie hurries up to him.

                                     ANGIE
                         Watsa matter with you?

               Marty pauses, one foot in the booth.

                                     MARTY
                         You don't like her. My mother don't 
                         like her. She's a dog, and I'm a 
                         fat, ugly little man. All I know is 
                         I hadda good time last night. I'm 
                         gonna have a good time tonight. If 
                         we have enough good times together, 
                         I'm gonna go down on my knees and 
                         beg that girl to marry me. If we 
                         make a party again this New Year's, 
                         I gotta date for the party. You don't 
                         like her, that's too bad.

               Marty has been fishing in his pocket for his address book. 
               He opens it to its proper page and steps decisively into the 
               phone booth.

               Nearby, Angie prowls around outside the booth. The booth 
               door is open. Marty starts to dial. A hush fills the room 
               except for the CLICKING of the telephone dial.

               INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH.

               The look of fury has drained from Marty's face. He holds the 
               receiver to his ear, glances out toward Angie. CAMERA ANGLES 
               to include Angie.

                                     MARTY
                              (his old amiable self)
                         When you gonna get married, Angie? 
                         Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You're 
                         thirty-three years old. All your kid 
                         brothers are married. You oughta be 
                         ashamed of yourself.

               Still smiling at his very private joke, Marty returns to the 
               phone, and after a fraction of a second...

                                     MARTY
                         Hello... Clara?...

               As Angie looks miserable, and Marty slowly reaches out and 
               pushes the phone booth door shut, and continues to talk into 
               the phone, we very slowly...

               FADE OUT.

          Viking explorer LEIF ERICSON carefully studies his fob compass as 
          he dangles it above a parchment map. His SAILORS steal nervous 
          looks at a large, diabolical-looking IRON BOX in the hold.
           
          OLAF, a fierce, one-eyed Viking warrior approaches Ericson. NOTE: 
          Dialog is in OLD NORSE, with SUBTITLES)
           
          OLAF
          Leif, let's do the deed
          before another night falls. The crew's
          near mutiny.
           
          Ericson draws his broadsword with a flourish.
           
          LEIF ERICSON
          Know this! The first man to turn
          will taste my steel in his guts.
           
          OLAF
          But we've surely gone far enough.
           
          ERICSON
          That accursed box must be thrown
          off the edge of the world. We
          will go until we can go no more...
           
          Suddenly there is an ear-splitting SCREECH and the entire boat 
          rocks violently as it runs aground.
           
          The LOOKOUT is thrown from his crow's nest... and CRASHES 
          straight through the deck right in front of Ericson. His pained 
          voice floats up 
          from the black hole.
           
          LOOKOUT
          ...Land ho.
           
          Ericson wheels about just as the fog parts off the starboard bow.

          Olaf finishes digging a hole in the sand. He backs away, 
          terrified, as burly Vikings, led by Ericson, muscle the IRON BOX 
          over to the hole and 
          quickly bury it. Ericson turns to an exotic-looking Eurasian 
          WITCH.
           
          ERICSON
          Be quick, Witch. Let the deed
          be done.
           
          The Witch unravels a scroll and recites:
           
          WITCH
          Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief
          dwell now in waters, base and
          bland. And in waves and sand thy
          magic forever sleep...
           
          As the Witch speaks, a strong wind kicks up and a black wall of 
          clouds appears. The sky explodes in THUNDER and LIGHTNING. The 
          MEN 
          look about fearfully.
           
          ERICSON (CONT.)
          Back to the ship men, hurry.
           
          OLAF
          Captain, you've discovered a new
          world. It is your right to name it.
           
          ERICSON
          Leave that to the Italians. We're
          never coming back here. Never.
          This land is now cursed.

          Hey Charlie, can you go over these
          stats? We're supposed to have
          a complete report before lunch.
           
          Charlie takes one looks at the complex print-outs and tosses them 
          back.

          Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had
          my weave tightened and my head
          is killing me. Be a pal and take
          those over to Hinkleman, will ya?
           
          MAGGIE, a cute young blonde now strolls by.

          Hi guys. Did you have any luck
          with those concert tickets
          Stanley?
           
          Stanley perks up at the sight of her.
           
          STANLEY
          I sure did. Friday night, just
          like you wanted.
           
          MAGGIE
          Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful.
           
          STANLEY
          What time should I pick you up?
           
          MAGGIE
          Gee, I don't know. My best
          girlfriend just got into town and
          I know she'd love to go. Can we
          get an extra ticket for her?
           
          STANLEY
          Well... uh, actually it's sold
          out. I was kinda lucky to get
          these.
           
          MAGGIE
          She's only going to be in town
          a couple of days and I just can't
          let her sit at home all alone.
          Are you sure there isn't something
          we can do?
           
          Stanley considers the situation for a moment, then pulls the 
          tickets out of his pocket.
           
          STANLEY
          You know what? Here. You two
          go.
           
          MAGGIE
          Oh Stanley, I couldn't do that.
           
          STANLEY
          No really. Go ahead. It's okay.
          I hate concerts anyway. All that,
          you know... music floating around.
           
          Maggie snatches the tickets from Stanley's hand.
           
          MAGGIE
          That is so sweet. Sheila's just
          going to love this.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe you and I can get
          together over the weekend?
           
          MAGGIE
          I'm not sure what's going on, but
          just give me a call. You know
          I like to be spontaneous.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, sure. Me too.
           
          MAGGIE
          Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest
          guy.
           
          Maggie gives him a quick air-kiss and hurries off to her teller's 
          window.
           
          CHARLIE
          That's it.
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          The kiss of death. As soon as
          they use the "N" word it's all
          over.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe I am a nice guy. So
          what?
           
          CHARLIE
          You are a rug. I am talking
          astro-turf here. You're letting
          these women sharpen their cleats
          on you.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, I'm a gentleman. If they
          can't appreciate that, it's their
          problem.
           
          CHARLIE
          You spend too much time being
          "nice" to a girl, you'll wind up
          sittin' around listening to her
          complain about the son of a bitch
          she really loves.
           
          STANLEY
          Charlie, you are a very sick
          puppy.
           
          CHARLIE
          Wake up, Stanley! These are the
          nineties. We're dealing with an
          entire generation of dysfunctional
          love junkies. You can't romance
          'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's
          the only thing that gets their
          attention.

          Let me demonstrate. You see that
          girl over there?

          Hi Lisa.

          Oh, hi...

          Charlie.
           
          LISA
          That's right. Sorry.
           
          CHARLIE
          Lisa, this may seem a little odd,
          but my friend over there and I
          were having this discusion and
          I thought maybe you could settle
          it for us.
           
          LISA
          I'll help out if I can.
           
          CHARLIE
          (SHEEPISHLY)
          Actually, I don't know... this
          is kind of a personal question.
           
          LISA
          That's okay. Go ahead.
           
          CHARLIE
          Alright. Just for the sake of
          argument, if I wasn't a happily
          married man... am I the kind of
          guy you'd go out with?
           
          LISA
          Oh, um... I don't know.
          (PAUSES)
          Well... yeah. I guess I would.
           
          CHARLIE
          Lisa, I have terrific news for
          you.
           
          LISA
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          I'm not married! Is this perfect
          or what? Listen, there's not a
          lot of women willing to come right
          out like that and admit they're
          attracted to a guy, but...
           
          Lisa SLAPS Charlie, turns on her heel, and marches off.
           
          CHARLIE (CONT.)
          Jeez... make up your mind.
           
          Stanley gives Charlie the fish eye as he returns.
           
          CHARLIE
          Okay. Bad example. Some
          of these women got so much baggage
          they need an emotional sky cap.
          I'll tell you what Stanley,
          tonight I'm gonna take you on a
          love safari, deep into the darkest
          heart of the urban jungle.
           
          STANLEY
          And where's that?
           
          CHARLIE
          The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new
          club in town. It's a guaranteed
          skirt alert and no dead beats
          allowed.
           
          STANLEY
          So how are we gonna get in?
           
          CHARLIE
          Woah, do I detect a little
          self-image problem there, buddy?
          You just leave everything to me.
          This, my friend is going to be
          the perfect night on the town.
           
          Suddenly a resounding peal of THUNDER rings out like the crack of 
          doom. Sheets of rain pour down on the bank's windows.

          INT. BANK - FOYER
           
          A young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper over her 
          head. She's soaking wet and pauses in the foyer to straighten 
          herself out.
           
          Charlie immediately notices her...
           
          CHARLIE
          Hold the phone. Killer at three
          o'clock.
           
          Stanley follows his gaze.
           
          STANLEY'S P.O.V.
           
          CAMERA does a classic CHEESECAKE TILT-UP starting with the 
          woman's million dollar legs as she squeezes some of the water out 
          of her 
          skirt... up past her body, which through her damp summer clothes 
          is undeniable proof that there is a God... up... up... to her 
          face as that 
          newspaper is tossed aside. She's a heart-stopping woman/child 
          with a Cupid's bow mouth and ice blue eyes. In other words she's 
          trouble. 
          Big trouble, also known as TINA CARLYLE.
           
          Charlie may as well have just seen the Virgin of Guadalupe.
           
          CHARLIE
          (hushed reverence)
          Oh my god... A perfect dime. The
          dame of dames. The Moby of my
          dick.
           
          STANLEY
          Easy Charlie. You'll sprain your
          eyes.
           
          Tina now enters and walks towards Stanley and Charlie.
           
          TINA
          Excuse me, where can I open a new
          account?
           
          Charlie flashes his best 100 watt smile.
           
          CHARLIE
          You've come to the right place,
          ma'am. Just step right this way
          and pull up a chair...
           
          Charlie tries to steer Tina to his desk, but she's still 
          preoccupied with her damp clothing.
           
          TINA
          Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete
          wreck. Will you hold this please?
           
          She hands her shoulder bag to Stanley and peels off her wet 
          blazer, creating another awe-inspiring visual moment.
           
          CHARLIE
          Here, let me take that for you.
           
          Charlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles.
           
          TINA
          Thanks.
           
          But Tina turns and sits at Stanley's desk; Charlie is stunned at 
          his near miss, but there's not a thing he can do about it.
           
          STANLEY
          So, uh, what kind of account did
          you have in mind?
           
          TINA
          (smiles sweetly)
          Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
          just terrible with things like
          that. That's an interesting tie
          Mr...?
           
          STANLEY
          Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss...
           
          Tina extends her hand.
           
          TINA
          Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet
          you.
           
          STANLEY
          The, uh... pleasure's all mine.
           
          Tina notices a box of Kleenex on Stanley's desk.
           
          TINA
          May I? I'm such a mess.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh... of course.
           
          Tina takes out a compact and daintily blots the moisture from her 
          face.
           
          TINA
          As I was saying about that tie. It's
          like one of those, what do you
          call them, ink blot tests.
           
          STANLEY
          A Rorschach test.
           
          She twists open a tube of lip gloss andbegins to run it across 
          her incredibly lush liips.
           
          TINA
          That's it. It looks like... um.
          A young woman riding bareback.
          You know, like a Lady Godiva or
          something.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? I don't think I can...
           
          She slowly runs a finger along Stanley's tie.
           
          TINA
          Or... if that's not a horse it
          could be two lovers. A man and
          a woman. That would be the woman
          on top, of course.
           
          STANLEY
          (MESMERIZED)
          ...Of course.
           
          She licks her lips and blots them on the Kleenex, leaving a 
          perfect kiss impression and drops it on Stanley's desk.
           
          TINA
          What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?
           
          Stanley starts to get uncomfortable under her gaze.
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know. ...Bold colors.
          It's a power tie, y'know? They're
          supposed to make you feel...
          powerful.
           
          TINA
          Does it work?
           
          STANLEY
          Sort of. It's just a tie. Now,
          about that account.
           
          CLOSE-UP
           
          as Tina drops her compact back in her shoulder bag and we see her 
          flick a red L.E.D. light on. She carefully adjusts the bag, 
          aiming a tiny 
          CAMERA LENS neatly concealed within it.
           
          Tina's pointing the bag at the open bank vault that stands a 
          short distance from Stanley's desk.

          a week.

          Not cool. What about the coin?

          There's plenty. And I'll be happy
          to invest your share.

          Dorian pulls back a curtain. An amazingly gaudy building stands

          and it will drive this two bit

          But I say if you can't beat 'em,

          cab.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it up right here, please.
           
          A gun port suddenly SLAMS open and the wild-eyed Albanian TAXI 
          DRIVER wheels about and cocks a huge .45 from his side of the 
          BULLET 
          riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic.
           
          DRIVER
          Hold up?! No hold up! I keel
          you very well! I splatter your
          guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man!
           
          Stanley dives for cover.
           
          CHARLIE
          No! No! He only wants you to
          stop the cab!
           
          The driver instantly SLAMS on the brakes, throwing his passengers 
          forward mercilessly.
           
          DRIVER
          (now totally calm)
          Hokay. Pardon you very much.

          the area for signs of life. We can hear the CLANK-CLANK-CRASH of 
          SOME 
          less than light-fingered automotive work in progress.
           
          Stanley DINGS a little service bell sitting on a counter 
          plastered with naked playmate decoupage and Mrs. Power Tool '93

          STANLEY
          ...Hello?
           
          IRV, a lumbering unshaven behemoth of a man with permanently low-
          slung refrigerator repairman pants, makes his way past half 
          rebuilt car 
          carcasses towards Stanley.
           
          IRV
          Hang on. Hong on. Don't get your
          panties in a twist.
           
          BURT, a thinner version of Irv with Coke bottle glasses and a mop 
          of greasy hair, pops up from beneath a car, RIPS out of chunk of 
          motor and 
          wiring and holds it up to Irv.
           
          BURT
          (examining part)
          Hey Irv, what the hell is this?
           
          IRV
          (eyes it carefully)
          Ohh... I dunno. About seven
          hundred bucks.
           
          They both laugh evilly as Irv slaps Burt on the back. Irv makes 
          his way over to Stanley, still chuckling to himself.
           
          IRV
          Now what can I do for you, Bub?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm here for the Civic.
           
          IRV
          Japanese car, right? Kind of a
          nasty pea soup green?
           
          STANLEY
          Well, they call it Emeral Forest,
          actually...
           
          Irv turns back to Burt.
           
          IRV
          Burt! Pea green Civic!
           
          Burt pops back up from beneath the hood.
           
          BURT
          Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh
          yeah! Brake drums are still on
          order and I'm only halfway through
          rebuilding the trans.
           
          STANLEY
          But I just brought it in for an
          oil change!
           
          IRV
          Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught
          those other problems before they
          caused some serious trouble.
           
          STANLEY
          Alright. Alright. When will it
          be ready?
           
          Irv looks over at Burt, who gives him a "Make something up" look.
           
          IRV
          Come back tomorro...
          (Burt shakes his head "no".)
          ...First thing next wee...
          (Burt shakes again)
          ...next month?
          (Burt shakes an enthusiastic "yes".)
          Yeah, first thing next month.
          That's if we can get the parts.
           
          STANLEY
          What am I going to do in the
          meantime? I can't afford to keep
          taking cabs all over town.
           
          Irv smiles a rotten-toothed smile.
           
          IRV
          Oh, hell... we can take care of
          that!
          (to Burt archly)
          Hey Burt, bring around the loaner.
          (to Stanley)

          keep up with the flow;
           
          A glistening pearlescent Rolls Royce.
           
          A fire engine red Ferrari.
           
          A classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy.
           
          And finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle 
          gray RUMBLES up to the front of the club with a disgruntled 
          Stanley behind 
          the wheel.
           
          A car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut. 
          Stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops 
          open with a SCREECH of 
          metal. Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street.
           
          He smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain 
          at the eyesore-mobile. He pats the hood.
           
          STANLEY
          It's a classic.
           
          The car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with a 
          horrible GRINDING. He finally waves over two other car hops who 
          quickly push 
          it off down the street.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What
          is that, a Rolls Canardley?
           
          STANLEY
          A what?
           
          CHARLIE
          You know, a Rolls Canardley.
          Rolls down one hill canardley roll
          up the next.
          (he cracks up)
           
          STANLEY
          We are not discussing the car,
          okay?
           
          CHARLIE
          Whatever you say, man.
           
          Charlie gestures expansively towards the club.
           
          CHARLIE
          What do you think? Pretty
          terrific, huh? This place make
          Sodom and Gomorrah look like
          Mayberry.
           
          Stanley now notices a life-sized poster of Tina Carlyle standing 
          by the main entrance that reads "Featuring the Musical Stylings 
          of Miss Tina 
          Carlyle."
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, isn't that...
           
          CHARLIE
          Right. The wet dream from the
          bank.
          (PAUSES)
          Hold on... I think I see my future
          ex-wife.
           
          Two rather tacky looking GIRLS beckon Charlie from the crowd.
           
          GIRLS
          Hey Charlie! Charlie!
           
          CHARLIE
          (WAVES)
          We're in luck. It's Barbie and
          Pebbles.
           
          STANLEY
          Doesn't it bother you that all
          the women you know are named after
          cartoon characters?
           
          Barbie and Pebbles hurry over through the crowd.
           
          BARBIE
          We've been waiting out here for
          hours. Can you get us in?
           
          CHARLIE
          No, problemo. Ladies, this is my
          pal Stanley Ipkiss.
          (leans closer)
          Stanley's very influential in the
          banking business.
           
          Charlie is truly in his element as he elbows his way through the 
          crowd dragging his entourage with him.
           
          EXT. THE FRONT DOOR
           
          Charlie finally makes through the crush of badies at the entry 
          way's velvet ropes and calls to one of the two hulking BOUNCERS 
          that guard the 
          door.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's
          happening man?
           
          Bobby completely ignores Charlie as he ushers a pasty faced ROCK 
          STAR and his underage TARTLET past the ropes.
           
          CHARLIE (CONT.)
          (to the girls)
          This will just take a second.
          (to the other bouncer)
          Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie!
           
          Nick is also completely oblivious.
           
          STANLEY
          Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to
          stand here waiting to be judged
          by these power-mad steroid
          jockeys.
           
          CHARLIE
          How much cash you got on you?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          CHARLIE
          You heard me. How much you got?
           
          STANLEY
          I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hand it over.
           
          STANLEY
          No way.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only
          carrying plastic. C'mon man, you
          want to stand out here all night?
           
          Stanley begrudgingly starts to count out some cash. Charlie 
          snatches the whole wad and elbows his way back around to the 
          ropes.
           
          CHARLIE
          (subtly flashing bills)
          Hey Bobby!
           
          Bobby's uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up.
           
          BOBBY
          Charlie, how you doin' man? Long
          time no see.
           
          Bobby unsnaps the rope for Charlie and gets the cash handshake he 
          longs for.
           
          The crowd surges around Charlie, Barbie and Pebbles as they step 
          by, briefly cutting Stanley off.
           
          He catches up just as the all-important rope is SNAPPED closed.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey, wait a minute! Charlie!
           
          But Charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside. 
          Dorian now steps out of the club and begins to check Bobby's 
          list.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          I'm with them! Hey, Bobby!
           
          But Bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine. Stanley unsnaps 
          the rope himself and starts throgh. Bobby and BOUNCER #2 
          IMMEDIATELY 
          grab Stanley and quickly subdue him.
           
          STANLEY
          Hey! Leggo... awk!
           
          Dorian glares at Stanley.
           
          DORIAN
          Lose him.
           
          The bouncers drag Stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously 
          toss him out into the rain-slick street.
           
          ANGLE ON THE STREET
           
          Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A 
          horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings 
          into the 
          club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water.
           
          Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina 
          Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR 
          carrying an umbrella. 
          She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting 
          a losing battle to restrain her decolletage.
           
          Their EYES MEET. Tina pauses as she recognizes him.
           
          TINA
          (SMILES)
          Oh... Stanley. Hi.
           
          Stanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little 
          wave hello anyway.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          Are you okay?
           
          Stanley gestures "no problem" and tries to strike a casual pose 
          against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls.
           
          With a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the 
          car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him.
           
          Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the 
          car hop's tip money... nothing.
           
          He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in. 
          The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of 
          NOXIOUS 
          exhaust fumes.
           
          DISSOLVE TO:
           
          EXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT
           
          A forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear 
          Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually 
          pulls into 
          sight on the dark rain-slick street.
           
          INT. CAR
           
          Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine 
          starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies.
           
          EXT. BRIDGE
           
          Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. 
          Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely 
          to restart the 
          engine.
           
          Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a 
          SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly 
          falls off with a 
          resounding CLUNK.
           
          Beat.
           
          The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's 
          side door CLATTERS to the ground.
           
          Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless 
          metal... his mind a complete blank.
           
          He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water 
          swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy 
          sweeps over 
          him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it 
          drops down... down to the river below.
           
          Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating 
          along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Hey... Hey mister!
           
          EXT. RIVER BANK
           
          Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge. 
          He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and 
          HURRIES 
          as fast as he can.
           
          CAMERA DOLLIES with Stanley as he scrambles down the slope; a 
          black cat YOWLS as it races past him. He steps on and shatters a 
          discarded mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans 
          against the bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore.
           
          Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch 
          the body as it floats by.
           
          CLOSER - BODY
           
          As Stanley grabs it, the "body" falls to pieces... revealing that 
          it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some floating bits 
          of garbage all 
          clinging to the "head": an old wooden Mask.
           
          Stanley shakes his head in disgust... some lifesaver.
           
          Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic 
          symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie 
          empty eye holes.
           
          The faintest sound of a haunting "Mask SFX Theme" rises as 
          Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside... slowly 
          bringing it 
          closer and closer to his face. The surface of the Mask begins to 
          SHIMMER.
           
          But then... RIBET! A frog jumps out of it, right into Stanley's 
          face. Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river 
          bottom.
           
          Suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down from the bridge and an 
          amplified voice calls out from a squad car.
           
          POLICEMAN
          Hey, you! What are you doing down
          there?
           
          Stanley squints into the light, trying to think of a reasonable 
          answer.
           
          STANLEY
          I was just looking for...
          (holds up Mask)
          My mask.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. MONKEY'S PAW - NIGHT
           
          The club is closing up. WAITERS stack chairs on top of tables in 
          the B.G. as Tina gathers her sheet music from her PIANIST.
           
          TINA
          Thanks Reno, you're the greatest.
           
          RENO
          G'night, doll.
           
          Tina crosses to the bar area where Dorian lounges with DR. 
          FREEZE, SWEET EDDY and CHUN WOO. Dorian toasts her as she pulls 
          up a bar 
          stool.
           
          DORIAN
          That was a great performance,
          baby. But not as great as the
          one you pulled off at the bank.
           
          TINA
          Yeah, well don't get used to it.
          I'm not going to start running
          cons for you again, Dorian. I'm
          a singer now and that's it.
           
          Dorian rolls his eyes at Freeze, "Get her".
           
          DORIAN
          Oh, really? And you had such a
          red hot career before you latched
          on to me?
           
          Tina pours herself a drink.
           
          TINA
          Who latched on to who?
           
          DORIAN
          Get real, Tina. You'll do what
          I say or I'll drop you back where
          I found you, slingin' hash and
          dodgin' horny peterbuilt drivers.
           
          TINA
          (downs a shot)
          Don't push me, Nicky. I might
          just take a walk I should have
          taken a long time ago.
           
          DORIAN
          (CHUCKLES)
          Easy, baby. Easy.
          (to his men)
          I love it when she gets pissed.
           
          Dorian scoots over and puts an arm around Tina. She remains cool.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          C'mere. You take a hike and who's
          gonna kiss you like Dorian Tyrel.
           
          Tina pours another shot.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          C'mon. Who?
           
          Tina finally cracks a smile.
           
          TINA
          Nobody.
           
          DORIAN
          (pulls her close)
          That's right, baby. C'mere.
           
          Tina slowly leans in for a kiss, her lips softly parted... but 
          raises a finger to Dorian's lips, stopping him cold. She glances 
          over at Freeze.
           
          TINA
          Sorry. I never get personal in
          front of the help.
           
          Tina abruptly stands and exits as Freeze glares at her.
           
          Dorian breaks into laughter.
           
          DORIAN
          That broad kills me.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          She just might, man. The bitch
          is trouble.
           
          Dorian pours them all a drink.
           
          DORIAN
          C'mon Doctor, lighten up.
          (raises his glass)
          Here's to Edge City Bank.
          May it crack like an egg on Easter
          Sunday.
           
          Their glasses CLINK.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          The police car pulls up in front of Stanley's brownstone and he 
          wearily climbs out.
           
          OFFICER
          Okay, Mr. Ipkiss. Try to be a
          little more careful next time.
           
          STANLEY
          Thanks Officer.
           
          The black and white pulls away and Stanley starts across the 
          empty street.
           
          VOICE
          Hey, mister...
           
          Stanley turns.
           
          A razor-cut DEATH'S HEAD PUNKER hops down from a fire escape in a 
          darkened alleyway.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          You a cop or something?
           
          A half dozen other DEATH'S HEADS appear out of the shadows all 
          decked out in nipple chains, tattoos and other self-mutilation-
          AS-FASHION 
          oddments.
           
          STANLEY
          Uh... no. They just gave me a
          lift.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          A cop chauffeur? I never seen
          that before. How about you boys?
           
          The other Death's Heads pipe up with "Not Me," "Nope," "Pretty 
          special," etc. as they slowly surround Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          Alright, you guys. It's been a
          tough night. I haven't got any
          money. I haven't got a car. All
          I have is this and you're
          welcome to it.
           
          Stanley tosses Death's Head #1 the Mask.
           
          He briefly inspects the funky looking antique, still slick with 
          river slime, then tosses it back. He approaches Stanley.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          Hey, man. You got us all wrong.
          We don't want any trouble. I was
          just going to ask you for the
          time. That's all. You got the
          time?
           
          STANLEY
          Uh... yeah.
           
          As Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's 
          Head flicks out a butterfly knife. With a FLASH of steel, he 
          slices straight 
          through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD
          (holding up his prize)
          See, I only wanted the time! Heh,
          he, heh...
           
          All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head 
          #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across 
          to #3 and 
          so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more 
          violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally 
          breaks free and 
          scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness. He 
          fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the Death's 
          Heads roar with 
          laughter.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          Stanley's wet shoes SQUEAK as he tiptoes past -
           
          APARTMENT "A" - MANAGER
           
          A sign that reads "Quiet Please" hangs from the doorknob. Stanley 
          continues past it to Apartment "B". Just as he removes his keys - 
          THE 
          Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN appears. She's an old 
          dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to 
          spite her 
          relatives.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what
          time it is?
           
          Reflexively, he looks at his (now empty) wrist.
           
          STANLEY
          Actually, no.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          It's three o'clock in the morning!
          First, you wake up the entire
          building laughing it up with your
          pals. Then, you come in and start
          squeak -
          (sees puddles)
          My new carpet! Just look at that!
          This is coming out of your
          cleaning deposit Ipkiss!
           
          Stanley, battered, bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban 
          shell-shock.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTLY)
          Are you done?
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          ...Yes.
           
          STANLEY
          I think I'll be going to bed now.
           
          Mrs. Peenman SLAMS her door.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUES
           
          Small, full of books but very neat. A few cherished animation 
          cels from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall. As Stanley locks 
          the door behind 
          him - he's greeted by MILO, a happy little terrie sized mutt with 
          a big heart.
           
          STANLEY
          Hello, Milo.
           
          Milo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Easy, buddy. I missed you too.
           
          Stanley pats Milo on the rump, crosses his tiny kitchenette and 
          heads straight into...
           
          THE BEDROOM
           
          Stanley's prized collection of "golden Age" Looney Tunes tapes 
          are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf.
           
          He tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his 
          cherished Tex Avery cartoons into the V.C.R., plops down on his 
          bed and 
          starts to strip off his shoes and socks.
           
          MILO
           
          enters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          C'mon, Milo. I'm beat.
          (to the dog YIPS)
          Okay, okay. One throw.
           
          Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air. The disk sails...
           
          OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY
           
          Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots 
          back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap.
           
          STANLEY
          Easy. This is the best part.
           
          On the screen a cartoon dog ZZZIPS into frame and drops a 
          frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guy's pants. KA-BOOM! The 
          dog LAUGHS 
          maniacally.
           
          Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the wall that rattles Stanley's 
          framed cartoon cels.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (calls out)
          Sorry Mrs. Peenman.
           
          With a sigh, he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show POPS 
          on. Larry King and a guest.
           
          Stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up.
           
          ANGLE ON T.V.
           
          King's guest, Dr. Arthur Neuman, is replying to a caller.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          That's correct. The truth is we
          all wear masks, metaphorically
          speaking. We repress the Id...
          our darkest desires and hide
          behind a more socially acceptable
          image of ourselves in order to
          cope with the frustrations of our
          day to day lives.
           
          Stanley's only half listening though the open bathroom door as he 
          brushes his teeth.
           
          STANLEY
          Think I'm repressed, Milo?
           
          Stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom 
          mirror, his mouth foaming with toothpaste.
           
          Milo does that doggie-head-cocked-sideways "What the hell?" look.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (HALF-HEARTEDLY)
          Nah.
           
          He spits and rinses.
           
          ANGLE ON T.V.
           
          as King wraps it up, displaying the doctor's book.
           
          LARRY KING
          The book is "The Masks We Wear,"
          by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you
          Dr. Neuman.
           
          Stanley pops off the T.V.with his remote.
           
          STANLEY
          No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
           
          As he buttons up his P.J.s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing 
          at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table. A 
          SUBTLE 
          SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off 
          the bed.
           
          We now begin to hear the "Mask Theme"... echoes of the POUNDING 
          Viking drums... growing louder. Haunting whispery VOICES seem to 
          call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside. He picks up 
          the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers 
          across the time 
          work wood. The music builds...
           
          He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask 
          to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.
           
          For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over 
          Stanley's head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.
           
          Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Whoa.
           
          Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror. 
          Everything's status quo. It must have been his imagination.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Naw...
           
          He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time. Milo dives under 
          the bed as...
           
          AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS:
           
          RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around 
          Stanley's head - locking the Mask in place.
           
          STANLEY'S PAJAMAS magically reweave themselves... growing in all 
          directions.
           
          HIS HEAD THROBS AND EXPANDS, turning lime green as it unites with 
          the Mask.
           
          STANLEY GRABS HIS HEAD - His body begins to move uncontrollably.
           
          Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope. The SFX get loonier 
          and loonier as he becomes...
           
          A HUMAN TORNADO. Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his 
          voice jumps one, two, five octaves.
           
          STANLEY
          Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee...
           
          A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The 
          whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise 
          FROM 
          the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing...
           
          THE MASK CREATURE
           
          He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley 
          material of Stanley's pajamas.
           
          The head is no longer Stanley's. It's large, bald and bright 
          green. The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief. The nose is small, 
          bony and beaked. 
          The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks 
          into a learning grin.
           
          The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether 
          unhuman. In fact, there's something downright charming about him.
           
          The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees.
           
          THE MASK
          S-s-s-nazzy!
           
          He SNAPS his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          It's party time!
           
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
           
          Trying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the 
          darkened corridor. The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK as 
          the Mask steps 
          with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT "A" with it's little "Quiet 
          Please" sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making the "SHUSH" 
          sign.
           
          Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of 
          Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          O, jeepers--!
           
          Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every 
          time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his 
          pocket and 
          starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. 
          Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but 
          those bells just keep 
          ringing.
           
          The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers 
          into the floor and reverberates through the building like 
          THUNDERBOLTS.
           
          The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out 
          covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look 
          at the Mask 
          with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and 
          SCREAMS bloody murder.
           
          The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and 
          his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror.
           
          Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she 
          appears cocking an enormous shotgun.
           
          MASK
          Easy lady! I was just killin'
          time!
           
          The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal 
          laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.
           
          The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast 
          away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH.
           
          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
           
          Sending his body SAILING our through the air towards the street 
          seven stories below.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
           
          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
           
          SPLAT. Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street. He 
          slow... painfully starts to rise as a STREET CLEANING machine 
          turns a 
          corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears down 
          the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body.
           
          He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself 
          off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and 
          straightens his 
          zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Hey! You missed a spot!
           
          As if on cue, a SECOND street cleaning machine SLAMS into him and 
          RUNS OVER HIM AGAIN. This time he reinflates himself back into 3-
          D 
          by blowing into his thumb and hops up.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          And next time, no starch!
           
          Fully recovered, Stanley/Mask starts down the street, strutting 
          like a prize fighter.
           
          VOICE
          Hey mister...
           
          Death's Head punker #1 hops down from his fire esscape behind the 
          Mask.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #1
          (grins evilly)
          ...You got the time?
           
          The Mask turns to see he is surrounded by the Death's Head 
          punkers. He seems to be delighted by their presence, but now that 
          they see his 
          face, they're totally freaked.
           
          MASK
          (wiggles eyebrows)
          Why of course, Cubbie. I got all
          the time in the world!
           
          He whips out his forearm (which grows large for emphasis cartoon-
          style). It's covered with crazily spinning watches, CHIMING 
          cuckoo clocks 
          and sun dials.
           
          MASK
          London, Paris, Rome, standard,
          substandard and no standards at
          all! And for our English friends
          we have... Big Ben!
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #1
          Big Ben?
           
           
          Stanley/Mask KICKS a nearby street post, snapping it in half and 
          sending a large decorative street clock PLUMMETING into the 
          sidewalk. 
          KA-BONG! It completely obliterates Death's Head #1. The other 
          gang members jump back in shock as the Mask races around the 
          corner.
           
          DEATH'S HEAD #2
          Get him!
           
          The Death's Heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around 
          the corner into the alleyway.
           
          INT. ALLEY
           
          They come to a screeching halt as they discover Stanley/Mask 
          dressed as a carnival barker. Multicolored lights and Calliope 
          music come from 
          out of nowhere.
           
          MASK
          And for my next trick...
           
          Long pink and blue balloons appear in Stanley/Mask's hands and he 
          instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into 
          AN 
          elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SCREECH.
           
          The Death's Heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all 
          this to do anything but stand there and stare. (These guys were 
          no rocket 
          scientists in the first place.)
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          And viola! We have a giraffe!
           
          Sure enough, he's created a first rate balloon sculpture. He 
          hands it to the biggest, dumbest Death's Head, who grins like a 
          little kid upon 
          receiving it.
           
          The Mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion, sculpting 
          more balloons. SCREECH POP.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A few more twists of the wrist
          and for you, Cubbie.
           
          He hands this next prize to Death's Head #3.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A French poodle! And finally my
          favorite...
           
          He goes into another flurry of motion.
           
          E.C.U. - BALLOON
           
          As the Mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon, it straightens 
          out and MORPHS into...
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          A Tommy gun!
           
          A real one! He immediately sprays the Death's Heads with hot 
          lead. RATATATATATAT!
           
          The greasy punkers dive for cover and scramble out of the alley 
          under a hail of bullets.
           
          Stanley/Mask tosses the gun aside, intoxicated with his newfound 
          powers.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Wait a minute. This is
          incredible! Why, with these
          powers I could be a superhero!
          I could fight crime... Work for
          world peace...
           
          C.U. - THE MASK
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          But first!...
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - NIGHT
           
          It's late, but there's still a light on inside.
           
          INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
           
          Burt and Irv, both woozy from drink, attempt to finish a card 
          game. A dozen empty beer bottles and two half eaten chili dogs 
          adorn the table.
           
          Irv takes a big bite of his chili dog and pauses to regard it 
          like a true connoisseur.
           
          IRV
          Now these are serious chili dogs.
           
          BURT
          I know. Here's the proof...
          (lets out a long BUUURP)
          Aaah. Even tastier the second
          time around.
           
          Irv leans forward and sticks out his index finger.
           
          IRV
          Hey Burt, pull on my finger.
           
          BURT
          No way, man.
           
          IRV
          No, really. Go ahead.
           
          BURT
          Irv, don't...
           
          Irv raises a leg anyway and rips off a nasty fart. BRAAAP!
           
          IRV
          (PROUDLY)
          That, my friend is the sweet smell
          of success.
           
          BURT
          (SHRUGS)
          No style. I give it a five tops.
           
          IRV
          Okay, how about... Soprano.
           
          Irv shifts his weight and hits an amazing high note. PWEEEEEP! 
          Burt is impressed in spite of himself.
           
          BURT
          Fine muscle control.
           
          IRV
          And now for my grand finale,
          THX... The audience is listening!
           
          Irv lets one loose in perfect sensurround.
           
          Suddenly the front door EXPLODES inward. Stanley/Mask stands 
          there SILHOUETTED like a gunfighter from a Clint Eastwood movie.
           
          Irv squints into the light, unable to make out the mysterious 
          figure.
           
          IRV
          Hey, 40 watt... we're closed!
          Nobody's here.
           
          MASK
          Ah... but you're here.
           
          Irv rises.
           
          IRV
          What I mean is...
           
          He lets loose a sneaker to help make his point. POOOOT.
           
          IRV
          Nobody's here that wants to
          help you.
           
          Stanley/Mask now steps into the light.
           
          MASK
          But I'm here to help you.
           
          Burt and Irv's eyes go wide as they get a better look at their 
          nemesis. Fear loosens Irv's sphincter and a last feeble bit of 
          gas escapes with a 
          FWEEP!
           
          Stanley/Mask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two gleaming 
          mufflers from the wall.
           
          MASK
          Sounds like you have a little
          exhaust problem there!
           
          There's a mad gleam in his eyes as he spins the mufflers like two 
          huge pistols and SNAPS them to a halt.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          We better do a few touch ups
          before you have some serious
          trouble.
           
          The Mask TWIRLS out of frame like a human tornado.
           
          Camera PUSHES IN past Burt and Irv's shocked expressions into an 
          E.C.U. of the garage's bare light bulb as it JIGGLES on its wire. 
          We can't see the mayhem, but we can hear wacky/bizarre sound F.X. 
          as the Mask whirls about the garage. WHIZ! SCREECH! BANG! AHOOGA!
           
          BURT AND IRV
          No!... Wait! Eeeeeyaah!
           
          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
           
          As that light bulb becomes the morning SUN peaking over Edge 
          City's skyline. CAMERA PULLS BACK through Stanley's bedroom 
          window...
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
           
          Stanley slowly awakens. He grabs his head and moans, looking and 
          feeling completely hung over. Then suddenly he remembers - and 
          JUMPS 
          out of bed with a start.
           
          He looks in the mirror, touching his face. It's the same old 
          Stanley. He looks at his paisley PJ's. Same old PJ's.
           
          He picks up the mask. Same old mask.
           
          STANLEY
          A dream... It was only a dream.
           
          Stanley starts to relax. There's a KNOCK at the door.
           
          INT. HALLWAY - DAWN
           
          Stanley's greeted by LT. KELLAWAY (50). This hound-dog of a cop 
          can't help but stare at Stanley's garish pajamas.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Nice PJ's pal.
           
          STANLEY
          Can I help you?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          STANLEY
          That's right.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Some kind of prowler broke in and
          attacked Mrs. Peenman.
           
          STANLEY
          (swallows hard)
          Really? I didn't hear a thing.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Then you must be a pretty sound
          sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she
          unloaded a couple rounds of 20
          ott buckshot five feet from your
          door.
           
          Kellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better 
          view of the damage. Mrs. Peenman stands there in the hall 
          tearfully speaking to 
          anither OFFICER.
           
          Stanley is flabbergasted to see:
           
          QUICK CUTS
           
          C.U. - The shotgun blasts in the walls.
           
          C.U. - The pot holes left from the mallet.
           
          C.U. - The shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock.
           
          All flashbacks from last night!
           
          STANLEY
          (GASPS)
          That's... impossible!
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Excuse me?
           
          Stanley quickly pulls himself together.
           
          STANLEY
          That's... a, possible. See, I
          have this inner ear problem.
          (wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously)
          Sometimes I can't hear a thing.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SKEPTICAL)
          Is that a fact?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          Kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself 
          and shoots Stanley a dirty look.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Forget it.
           
          He hands Stanley his card.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Here. You remember anything
          unusual about last night, anything
          at all, call me.
           
          STANLEY
          Sure... thanks.
           
          Stanley SLAMS the door and throws his body against it, his heart 
          pounding in his chest. Milo gives him that curious 
          dog-head-cocked-sideways look.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Milo, it was real! How could it
          all be... real?
           
          Stanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Oh my god. I'm late!
           
          He races into the bedroom.
           
          INT. HALLWAY
           
          Kellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from Mrs. 
          Peenman.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta
          admit your description is pretty
          tough to swallow.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Then you can choke on it for all
          I care. I saw what I saw.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Right.
          (refers to notes)
          A green head the size of a
          pumpkin, purple zoot suit and
          spats. That's a pretty serious
          fashion risk for any
          self-respecting second story man.
           
          An OFFICER now hurries up the steps all out of breath.
           
          OFFICER
          Lt., we just got an emergency call
          from a mechanic on 67th Street.
           
          KELLAWAY
          What?
           
          POLICEMAN
          Some kind of assault and battery.
          Sound pretty bad.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SIGHS)
          Alright. Dont' worry Mrs.
          Peenman, we'll find this guy for
          you. Officer Deluca here has a
          few forms you'll have to fill out.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT
           
          Stanley rushes around the apartment, but he can't find his keys 
          anywhere. He finishes tying his tie as he searches.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo! Keys! Keys!
           
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
           
          Milo's ears prick. He leaps up and immediately starts sniffing 
          around. He pulls a cushion off the sofa and emerges with the keys 
          just as Stanley 
          comes out, briefcaase in hand.
           
          STANLEY
          Good boy.
           
          He pets his dog, takes his keys and starts out the door... but he 
          pauses to take a last look at the mask... It's eerie black eye 
          holes and devilish 
          grin seem to mock him.
           
          On sudden impulse, he grabs it, hurls it out the balcony's 
          sliding glass door and exits.
           
          SLOW-MO - THE MASK
           
          Sailing end over end through the air.
           
          EXT. BUILDING
           
          As the mask flies out into the sir, a sudden wind kicks up.
           
          The mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and lands 
          balanced precariously on a narrow ledge. Its mocking grin seems 
          to glow 
          with triumph.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - DAY
           
          The place looks like it's been hit by cartoon graffiti 
          guerrillas: Everything's printed in polka-dots, checks, tartan, 
          etc. The 
          "Ripley Auto Finishing" sign hangs askew over the doorway. 
          Letters have been sprayed out to read "Rip Off!"
           
          Several REPORTERS and curious ONLOOKERS stand nearby as Kellaway 
          and his men take it all in. PARAMEDICS appear wheeling Burt and 
          Irv out of the building on two gurneys.
           
          They're both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than 
          men: Bodies spray painted metallic colors, hood ornaments glued 
          to their 
          foreheads, wire rims under each limb, and gleaming four foot long 
          mufflers sticking out of their rear ends.
           
          They wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney.
           
          BURT AND IRV
          Ah!... Eeeh!... Ooh!
           
          Paramedic #3 speaks into his emergency radio-phone as Burt and 
          Irv are loaded into the van.
           
          PARAMEDIC #3
          I want a proctologist standing
          by! Yeah, you heard me! The best
          one you can find.
           
          An OFFICER steps out of the building and approaches Kellaway.
           
          OFFICER
          We were able to get a description
          Lt., but it's pretty weird.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SIGHS)
          Let me guess... Big green head.
          Zoot suit.
           
          OFFICER
          How did you...
           
          KELLWAY
          Whoever this guy is, he's a world
          class twisto.
           
          PEGGY BRANDT, an attractive young woman in her mid twenties, 
          appears besides the other reporters and approaches Kellaway, 
          notepad in 
          hand.
           
          PEGGY
          Excuse me, Lt., I'm with the
          Evening Star. Can you tell me
          what happened here?
           
          KELLAWAY
          Sorry. Too early to comment.
           
          PEGGY
          It looks like some kind of mob
          scare tactic.
           
          KELLAWAY
          I said no comment. Now break it
          up. This is a crime scene.
           
          As the officers disperse the reporters and other onlookers, Peggy 
          slips away from the group. Even though it's closed off with 
          yellow police 
          tape, Peggy slips inside the garage.
           
          INT. MECHANIC'S OFFICE - DAY
           
          The empty garage has been turned into a topsy-turvy nightmare. 
          The same cartoon paint job covers the walls. Peggy looks around, 
          SIFTING 
          through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing.
           
          Then she spies the COMPLAINT BOX. Peggy opens it and pulls out a 
          HANDFUL of pink "comment" slips. She looks at them. Almost all of 
          them are from one customer - STANLEY IPKISS.
           
          INT. BANK - DAY
           
          Stanley, still looking rumpled and unshaven, hurriedly takes off 
          his coat and powers up his computer. Charlie steps over to his 
          desk carrying a 
          newspaper.
           
          CHARLIE
          What happened to you last night?
          The girls and I were looking all
          over for you.
           
          STANLEY
          I uh, didn't feel so good. I
          decided to go home early.
           
          CHARLIE
          As a matter of fact, you don't
          look so good. You got to take
          better care of yourself, man.
           
          STANLEY
          How was the club?
           
          CHARLIE
          Are you kidding? It was hotter
          than a pistol. Did you see the
          paper?
           
          STANLEY
          No.
           
          CHARLIE
          Your girlfriend got a great
          review.
           
          Chralie flips open the Entertainment section of the Evening Star. 
          There's a great close-up of Tina singing her heart out with the 
          HEADLINE 
          "Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw."
           
          MR. DICKEY, the smarmy office manager who is younger than 
          Stanley, now appears.
           
          DICKEY
          Ipkiss! You're forty minutes
          late! Every time you do that
          you're robbing this bank of its
          time and money!
           
          STANLEY
          Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't
          happen again.
           
          DICKEY
          (snatches newspaper)
          If you weren't so busy ogling
          girlie pictures you'd get some
          work done around here.
           
          CHARLIE
          Ah... She's a prospective client
          of Stanley's, sir.
           
          DICKEY
          (sudden attitude change)
          She is? Well... Next time she
          comes in see that you send her
          directly to my office.
           
          STANLEY
          Yes sir, Mr. Dickey.
           
          Dickey tosses the paper back on Stanley's desk and marches off 
          through the bank.
           
          CHARLIE
          Look at that little creep. If
          it wasn't for his daddy he'd be
          out somewhere shakin' down school
          kids for lunch money.
           
          Stanley toys with the Kleenex that bears Tina's lipstick "kiss".
           
          STANLEY
          You think she ever will come back,
          Charlie?
           
          CHARLIE
          Who knows? Forget about her,
          Stanley. A dame like that is
          always looking for the B.B.D.
          The bigger better deal. Ask her
          what her sign is and she'll say
          dollar.
           
          STANLEY
          You don't know that. She's an
          artist. Maybe she's sensitive.
           
          CHARLIE
          Yeah. She can sense a guy's
          credit line at two hundred yards.
          Stanley, you need a girl you can
          depend on. Someone a little more
          down to earth... someone like...
           
          ANGLE ACROSS THE BANK
           
          as Peggy Brandt stops by a teller's window, looking sharp and 
          pretty in a blazer and jeans.
           
          PEGGY
          Excuse me, can you tell me where
          I can find Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          BACK TO CHARLIE
           
          CHARLIE
          Like her! Someone like her.
          (straightens tie)
          As a matter of fact I could use
          someone like her myself.
          (rises as Peggy approaches)
          Hel-lo there. May I be of some
          assistance?
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley Ipkiss?
           
          Charlie begrudgingly points to Stanley.
           
          PEGGY (CONT.)
          Hi. I'm Peggy Brandt. I'm with
          the Evening Star.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, hi. I already have a
          subscription, thanks.
           
          PEGGY
          Oh no, actually I just wanted to
          ask you a few questions.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? About what?
           
          PEGGY
          Ripley Auto Finishing. You're
          a customer of theirs aren't you?
           
          STANLEY
          I... uh. No. I think you must
          have made a mistake.
           
          Peggy produces one of the complaint slips.
           
          PEGGY
          Isn't this a form of theirs you
          filled out?
           
          STANLEY
          (nervous chuckle)
          Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess
          I have stopped in there once or
          twice, Miss... what did you say
          your name was?
           
          PEGGY
          Peggy Brandt.
           
          STANLEY
          Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of
          "Ask Peggy"?
           
          PEGGY
          That's right.
           
          STANLEY
          (brightens up)
          You printed my letter last year,
          remember? "Nice Guys Finish
          Last."
           
          PEGGY
          You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do
          you realize how much mail we got
          about that letter? There's
          hundreds of women out there who
          are looking for a man just like
          you.
           
          STANLEY
          Are you serious?
           
          PEGGY
          Of course. DO you know how hard
          it is to find a decent man in this
          town? Most of them think monogamy
          is some kind of wood.
           
          STANLEY
          Why are you covering this story?
           
          PEGGY
          They cut my salary. I just can't
          make it by on "Dear Peggy"
          anymore. The truth is, I want
          to be a real reporter and if I
          can break this story I know
          they'll let me.
          (sits closer)
          Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto
          is a crooked operation. They may
          even have had ties to the Mob.
          I'm not out to get you. I just
          want the truth.
           
          STANLEY
          I wish I knew the truth, Peggy.
          I really do.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. MONKEY'S PAW ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON
           
          A well dressed MAN checks from beneath his sunglasses to see 
          nobody's watching and RAPS on the door. It opens and he quickly 
          DISAPPEARS 
          inside.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          Sweet Eddy escorts him inside. The man removes his glasses and 
          glances about nervously. Dorian sits at his desk. Dr. Freeze and 
          Chun Woo 
          are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment laid out 
          on the air hockey table.
           
          DORIAN
          Good afternoon, Councilman Snell.
          Nice of you to drop by.
           
          SNELL
          Cut the crap. Dorian. What's so
          important that I had to come here
          in person?
           
          Dorian gazes out the window to the Valhalla Casino.
           
          DORIAN
          I got a little job for you, Tom.
          I want you to pull the Swede's
          gambling license.
           
          SNELL
          That's impossible. He was
          approved six months ago.
           
          DORIAN
          Pull a few strings. Find
          something in the fine print. I
          don't care how you do it, but do
          it. You owe me.
           
          SNELL
          (CHUCKLES)
          I owe you nothing, you little
          piece of shit. I got your
          liquor license when nobody else
          would touch...
           
          Dorian suddenly EXPLODES, overturning his desk and sending Snell 
          tumbling backwards. In less than a heartbeat, he grabs Snell by 
          his shirt 
          ffront, SLAMS him up against the wall, SMASHES a whiskey bottle 
          and presses the jagged edge to his throat.
           
          Snell hangs there whimpering. Dorian has a crazed look in his 
          eyes as he gazes at the Councilman's lapel.
           
          DORIAN
          (SOFTLY)
          That's pretty. What is that, a
          carnation?
           
          Snell nods. Dorian takes a deep whiff.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Nice. Hey, Eddy... call my
          florist. Two dozen pink
          carnations to Mrs. Snell with my
          regrets over her husband's
          untimely accident.
           
          Tears begin to well up in Snell's eyes.
           
          SNELL
          (GASPING)
          No... please. I can do it. I
          can make it happen.
           
          Dorian eases back... brushes off Snell's coat.
           
          DORIAN
          That's smart. You're a very smart
          man. Now pull yourself together.
          Look at you.
           
          Dorian picks up an Uzi from Dr. Freeze's equipment.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Shut the Swede down, Snell. We'll
          buy him out cheap with a little
          collateral the bank is about to
          provide us.
          (looks at his men)
          And Gentlemen... we are going to
          be in the casino business.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. STANLEY'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
           
          Distant sirens can be heard over the occasional sound of a 
          gunshot. It's a reasonably peaceful night in Edge City.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
           
          CAMERA SLOWLY PANS off of Tina's picture, which is now taped to 
          Stanley's dresser mirror... to Stanley himself as he tosses and 
          turns in a 
          fitful sleep. Milo lies curled up at the foot of the bed. He 
          looks concerned over the little noises Stanley is making in his 
          sleep.
           
          CAMERA PUSHES INTO AN E.C.U. of Stanley as we
           
          DISSOLVE THROUGH INTO:
           
          STANLEY'S DREAM - a 1940s noir-style montage:
           
          Huge soft-lit faces loom over him, one dissolving into the 
          next... Tina, luminous and breathtaking speaks under heavily 
          lidded eyes.
           
          TINA
          Or it could be two lovers.
          That would be the woman on top,
          of course...
           
          Charlie looms up out of the darkness.
           
          CHARLIE
          Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what
          her sign is and she'll say dollar.
           
          Mr. Dickey appears, glaring down angrily at Stanley.
           
          DICKEY
          Every time you're late Ipkiss,
          you're robbing this bank!
           
          The shrink from the "larry King Show" floats by on a cloud of 
          pipe smoke.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          We must repress our Id... our
          deepest darkest desires.
           
          Finally Tina again standing beside the limo as she was that night 
          in the Monkey's Paw alley:
           
          TINA
          Hey, are you okay.
           
          Stanley stands at the curb, but this time he's not splattered 
          with mud. He's decked out in first class Armani and looks suave 
          as hell. He looks 
          straight into her eyes.
           
          STANLEY
          I am now. C'mere, baby.
           
          TINA
          (SWOONS)
          Oh, Stanley!
           
          She runs to his arms and they embrace in a passionate kiss. But 
          Tina suddenly pulls back and begins rapidly licking Stanley's 
          ear... which is 
          kinda weird.
           
          E.C.U. - STANLEY
           
          STANLEY
          Tina?
           
          Stanley suddenly realizes Milo is licking his ear... and he's 
          just woken up.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Milo, down.
           
          He pushes Milo away, tosses back the covers and rises out of bed. 
          It's still the dead of night and Stanley is all in a huff from 
          his dream.
           
          He spots Tina's clipping on his dresser mirror and rips it off, 
          upset with himself.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Stupid, stupid. She'd never...
           
          Stanley wheels about and to his complete surprise sees...
           
          THE MASK
           
          Through his bedroom window, propped up on the fourth story ledge. 
          Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear the 
          POUNDING beat of the Mask F.X. theme.
           
          STANLEY
           
          stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost 
          hear echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name. A deadly 
          siren song above 
          the pounding drums.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTLY)
          No...
           
          He backs away from the window.
           
          E.C.U. - THE MASK
           
          shimmers as the WHISPERS grow louder.
           
          STANLEY
           
          takes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his hand and 
          finally loses control. He bolts from the room.
           
          EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
           
          Stanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow 
          ledge. Milo tugs at his pajama leg, but Stanley kicks him away 
          and climbs out 
          over the ledge.
           
          THE LEDGE
           
          Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then 
          catches his balance. His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at 
          the leering face. 
          F.X. music THUNDERS in his head.
           
          THE MASK
          (faint echos)
          Stanley... Stanley.
           
          Stanley tries to steady himself, his eyes transfixed on his 
          prize.
           
          STANLEY
          Just... one... last... time.
           
          He lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a time 
          towards the mask.
           
          MILO
           
          watches from the apratment window, whimpering softly.
           
          C.U. - THE LEDGE
           
          Narrow masonry begins to crumble.
           
          STANLEY
           
          carefully reaches down, his fingers just brushing the mask as he 
          teeters out over nothingness. Night traffic whizzes by down 
          below.
           
          THE MASONRY
           
          cracks away.
           
          STANLEY
           
          SCREAMS as he begins to fall, jamming the mask to his face.
           
          INT. APARTMENT
           
          The window suddenly EXPLODES inwards as the whirling Stanley/Mask 
          tornado bursts into the room. Milo dives for cover.
           
          The tornado scorches the rug as it wheels around the room, then 
          SCREECHES to a halt, revealing the Mask in his full glory. He 
          strikes a grand 
          entrance pose with his arms held high.
           
          MASK
          (SINGS)
          I gotta be me! I just gotta be me!
           
          He ZZZIPS into the bathroom
           
          INT. BATHROOM
           
          The Mask sticks the picture of Tina on the bathroom mirror and 
          blows her a kiss.
           
          MASK
          (a'la Big Bopper)
          Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what
          you likah!
           
          He sprouts a couple of extra arms as he madly brushes his teeth, 
          sprays on cologne and bats himself with a powder puff all at 
          once.
           
          He ZZZIPS into the bedroom.
           
          INT. BEDROOM
           
          The Mask stands before a full length mirror and checks himself 
          out. With a magical "hands are quicker than the eye" move, he 
          CHANGES 
          wardrobe instantly... now posing in an effete fashion victim Don 
          Johnson-style suit.
           
          MASK
          The G.Q. look?... Naw.
           
          In a TWINKLING he's changed again: now in MTV Rapper-style over-
          sized jeans and backwards baseball cap.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          501's?
          (shakes his head)
          For buttonheads only.
           
          He changes again in a flash... This time he's naked except for 
          his Calvin Klein underwear (his stomach muscles appear super-cut 
          washboard-style).
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Marky Mark, eat your heart out.
           
          He changes one last time and appears in a wild banana yellow zoot 
          suit complete with a snap brim fedora. That's the ticket!
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          S-s-s-mokin! Now let's see...
           
          The Mask quickly searches his pockets. He pulls his pants pockets 
          inside out and a moth flutters out.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          What? Seems to be a minor cash
          flow problem here! I don't like
          to keep a lady waiting, but...
          (points a finger in the air)
          First things first!
           
          The Mask ZZZIPS out of frame.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT EDGE CITY BANK - NIGHT
           
          The street is quiet and empty, except for a Dipsy Doodle Diaper 
          delivery van parked across from the bank.
           
          INT. TRUCK
           
          Crowded with Dorian's men, it's been set up as a makeshift 
          control room for the robbery. Dr. Freeze SLAPS a clip in his 9mm 
          and looks down 
          through the van's false bottom to Sweet Eddy, who is standing in 
          an open manhole working on a bundle of underground wiring.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          What's the E.T.A.?
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Another five minutes.
           
          Freeze synchronizes his watch.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Counting down... now.
           
          Freeze presses a button on the side of a miniaturized headset 
          he's wearing
           
          DR. FREEZE (CONT.)
          (into headset)
          Lookin' good here, my man.
           
          INTERCUT - DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          He sits at his desk, speaking into a high tech walkie talkie. In 
          the B.G. Dorian's wall-mounted video monitors display live shots 
          of the club in full 
          swing.
           
          DORIAN
          Nice work, Freeze. You boy are
          on your own now. I've got to make
          sure I'm seen downstairs.
           
          DR. FREEZE (V.O.)
          Do it, man. The Doctah is about
          to operate.
           
          INT. VAN
           
          Freeze turns to his men.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Gentlemen...
          (cocks his gun)
          Let's do our duty and grab the
          booty.
           
          The burglars gather their gear when suddenly the bank alarm 
          starts RINGING.
           
          Freeze looks down the hole to Sweet Eddy.
           
          DR. FREEZE (CONT.)
          What the hell you doin', fool?
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Nothing! I didn't do nothing!
           
          FREEZE
          (to the others)
          C'mon! You keep that motor
          runnin'!
           
          EXT. BANK
           
          Freeze and company race across the street with guns drawn.
           
          ANGLE ON THE BANK DOORS
           
          Freeze and Chun Woo flatten themselves on either side of the door 
          as Burglar #4 drops to one knee and quickly picks the lock.
           
          Suddenly the glass doors EXPLODE wide open as a HUMAN WHIRLWIND 
          bursts out of the bank, shoots right past them and zig-zags up 
          THE 
          street. Twenty dollar bills slowly drift down onto the stunned 
          robbers in its wake.
           
          In an instant the whirlwind does a U-turn, zig-zag races back up 
          to them and SCREECHES to a halt. The Mask, still in his banana 
          yellow zoot suit 
          and carrying huge sacks of money like Santa Claus, plucks those 
          stray twenties from the air, one, two, three.
           
          MASK
          Sorry, fellas. Waste not want
          not!
           
          And ZZZOOM, he's off again. HOOTING laughter like a maniac.
           
          Freeze pulls his gun.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Get that sucker!
           
          Two cop cars now SQUEAL around the corner, their sirens blaring 
          and ROAR up the street at the bank robbers.
           
          DR. FREEZE
          Oh, shit!
           
          The robbers race back to the van, dive inside and PEEL OUT. The 
          police open fire as they roar after them in hot pursuit. Bullets 
          tear into the 
          van, blowing out the rear windows.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. MONKEY'S PAW
           
          The die-hard crowd of TRENDIES is piled up outside as usual 
          clamoring to get in. But a buzz of excitement begins to travel 
          through the crowd 
          as one by one they notice...
           
          A LIMOUSINE
           
          But not just any limousine. As it slowly pulls up by the front of 
          the club we realized it's long... longer... the longest limousine 
          we'vve ever seen. 
          Finally the passenger door rolls into sight and the limo comes to 
          a halt.
           
          The door bursts open and out leaps the Mask.
           
          THE MASK
          Ah... my public!
           
          The crowd parts like the Red Sea as the Mask sashays to the front 
          door. Bobby the Bouncer gets one look at the Mask and actually 
          loses his 
          cool.
           
          BOBBY
          Er, uh... Are you on the list?
           
          THE MASK
          No, but I believe my friends are.
          (fans a wad of cash)
          Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.
           
          He tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club 
          as the crowd scrambles for the cash.
           
          INT. MONKEY'S PAW
           
          This is the first time we've gotten a good look at the place and 
          it's a real eyeful. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO REVEAL its wild tropical 
          DECOR 
          complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees. 
          WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way across the 
          crowded dance 
          floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks.
           
          CAMERA ENDFRAMES as the hostess seats Dorian at his favorite 
          ringside table and removes the "reserved" sign. The lights dim an 
          all eyes 
          go to the bandstand.
           
          ANGLE OF THE BANDSTAND
           
          A spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a 
          gigantic fan revealing...
           
          TINA CARLYLE
           
          in a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and 
          mesh. If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress 
          would be arrested 
          for disturbing the peace.
           
          She talks/sings the intro of her number a capella.
           
          TINA
          There's all kinds of men
          In this old world
          That seek the affections
          Of a beautiful girl.
           
          But of the men from
          Which to choose
          There's only one type
          That I... ap...aprooove.
           
          And now the band slides in, in classic torch song style as Tina 
          sings "Checks Appeal". She works the room throughout the song, 
          driving the 
          men crazy as she lingers by each table.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          You can keep your cowboys
          on the farm
          The gigolos don't make me warm
          It's mink my fingers
          crave to feel
          I need a man with checks appeal.
           
          ANOTHER ANGLE
           
          The Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and 
          immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina.
           
          His eyes BUG OUT on stalks, an AHOOGA horn sounds and his heart 
          starts POUNDING wildly, shooting two feet out of his chest with 
          EACH 
          beat. Customers at nearby tables are astonished.
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          Pretty boys are such a bore
          There's manly macho types galore
          But you'll always know
          The diamond's real
          If you've got a man with checks appeal.
           
          The Mask snatches a bottle off a passing WAITRESS' tray and sucks 
          it down in one gulp. His head VIBRATES like an electric paint 
          shaker. 
          WWWOOOING! He CLAPS both hands on his head to hold it still.
           
          DORIAN'S TABLE
           
          Sweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          What the hell are you doing here?
           
          EDDY
          We got trouble. You better come
          upstairs.
           
          Dorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards 
          his office.
           
          ANGLE ON THE MASK
           
          as he continues to ogle Tina. His face now elongates into a 
          wolf's. He HOWLS, WHISTLES, pounds his fist on the table and 
          stomps his foot on 
          the floor.
           
          TINA
          Don't want to see too fanatic
          But dollar signs are so romantic
          I want a love
          That's deep and real
          Just with a man that's got...
          (big finish)
          Checks ap-peaaal.
           
          The audience goes crazy. Tina takes a bow.
           
          Suddenly the Mask ZZZIPS around the perimiter of the club, leaps 
          up on top of the piano and SNAPS his fingers. A spotlight hits 
          him.
           
          THE MASK
          Let's rock this joint!
           
          He grabs the stuffy, tuxedoed PIANIST'S stool and spins it hard. 
          When the pianist stops twirling, he been transformed into a hip, 
          BEATNIK 
          BE-BOPPER who immediately starts pounding out a mean BOOGIE-
          WOOGIE.
           
          The Mask produces a conductor's baton from thin air, spins around 
          and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy, WAILING 
          out a 
          driving rock 'n roll tune.
           
          Satisfied with the music, the Mask leaps down onto the dance 
          floor, grabs the astonished Tina and drags her off her feet into 
          a wild special 
          FX JITTERBUG.
           
          THE CROWD
           
          watches amazed as...
           
          THE MASK AND TINA
           
          put Fred and Ginger to shame. Jiving away at warp speed, the Mask 
          movves like a combination of Gumby and Barishnikov. He SHOOTS 
          TINA 
          beneath his legs, SNAPS her back into midair, SPINS her like a 
          baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat.
           
          THE MASK
          S-s-s-smokin!
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE
           
          Dorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr. Freeze, sitting there, 
          gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound 
          in his side.
           
          DORIAN
          What the hell happened to you?
           
          FREEZE
          I'll be okay. Nobody puts the
          chill on Freeze.
           
          DORIAN
          Where's the money?
           
          FREEZE
          Deal went south, Bro'. Someone
          else hit the place before we did.
           
          DORIAN
          Who?
           
          FREEZE
          Don't know. Dude looked like
          a freakin' goblin or something.
          Next thing we know there's cops
          all over us, man.
           
          DORIAN
          Where's Chun Woo?
           
          FREEZE
          Takin' a dirt nap. It was bad,
          man. Real bad.
          (swallows hard)
          I need a smoke.
           
          DORIAN
          Yeah... sure.
           
          Dorian taps out a cigarette, places it between Dr. Freeze's lips 
          and lights it... but the flame doesn't draw.
           
          Beat.
           
          The cigarette tumbles from Freeze's mouth.
           
          Dorian glances back up and sees that Dr. Freeze's eyes are glazed 
          over in death.
           
          Dorian leaps to his feat and hurls his chair across the room in 
          anger. It SMASHES the mirror over his bar.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Son of a bitch! Who did this
          Eddy? Who?
           
          Eddy is staring at Dorian's T.V. monitor. On it the Mask can 
          still be seen in the midst of his wild dance with Tina.
           
          EDDY
          That's him... That's the guy!
           
          Dorian grabs a .45 from his desk, checks the barrel and jams it 
          in his coat.
           
          DORIAN
          Come on!
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. DANCE FLOOR
           
          The Mask spins Tina all around him like a top and then SHOOTS her 
          straight up into the air.
           
          Amazingly, she continues somersaulting at the apex of her ascent, 
          suspended in mid-air by her magical momentum.
           
          THE MASK
           
          stands there nonchalantly filing his nails, whistling to himself.
           
          Tina continues to SPIN in place high above him.
           
          THE MASK
           
          casually checks his watch. Without looking up he holds out one 
          hand for the catch.
           
          TINA
           
          perfect timing... A final somesault and she drops right back down 
          into his arms. They go straight back into a rockin' hitterbug 
          without missing a 
          beat.
           
          THE WINDING STAIRCASE
           
          Dorian and Eddy race down the steps, guns drawn. Dorian calls to 
          Bobby by the hostess' stand.
           
          DORIAN
          Clear the club. Now!
           
          DANCE FLOOR
           
          The dance's grand finale. The Mask spins Tina around and around 
          his body like a baton in one of those awful Hawaiian fire dances.
           
          As the band bangs out the final bars of the tune, the Mask 
          SCREECHES Tina to a halt, bends her over backwards and nails her 
          with a Valentino 
          kiss that literally blows her shoes off; SSSMACK! KAPOW!
           
          She hangs onto the Mask's tie for support when BANG the tie is 
          shot in half. Tina falls on her cute behind.
           
          C.U. - TIE
           
          The shot-away piece of the Mask's tie flutters to the floor and 
          MORPHS back into a piece of Stanley's pajamas.
           
          DORIAN
           
          stands at the edge of the dance floor, his smoking gun trained on 
          the Mask.
           
          THE MASK
          (gasps in mock horror)
          Gee willickers! Does this mean
          we won't make the Star Search
          finals?
           
          DORIAN
          This means you won't make it out
          of this club alive if you don't
          tell me where my money is.
           
          THE MASK
          Okay...
           
          The Mask immediately whips out an old fashioned pull handle 
          calculator, snaps on a green visor and starts tabulating. KA-
          CHING.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          (fast talking)
          You got a 27.5% in T-Bills
          amortized over the fiscal yeah
          16-3/4% in stocks and bonds/
          (KA-CHING, KA-CHING)
          Carry the nine and divide by the
          Gross National Product...
           
          DORIAN
          Now cut that out!
          (turns to Eddy)
          Ventilate this goon!
           
          Eddy pulls out his .38 and starts blasting BLAM. BLAM.
           
          The Mask dodges the bullets by contorting his cartoon-flexible 
          body.
           
          BLAM. The Mask SPINS once and freezes in a pirouette, now dressed 
          in a tutu.
           
          BLAM. The Mask SPINS again and stops dressed as a matador, the 
          bullet whizzes under his cape.
           
          BLAM BLAM BLAM
           
          A hockey goalie bats the bullet away.
           
          A Russian Dancer leaps over the shot.
           
          A Cowboy DING! takes the hit.
           
          The Mask staggers back... the forwards in a classic Western death 
          scene. He throws an arm around Sweet Eddy for support.
           
          MASK
          Ak... you got me Pahdnuh.
          (cough... cough)
           
          Eddy seems touched by the Mask's dying words as he holds him in 
          his arms.
           
          MASK (CONT.)
          Hold me close, Red. It's a
          gettin' dark.
          (COUGH)
          Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller
          out.
          (cough... cough)
          Tell Tint Tim I won't be makin'
          it home for Christmas.
          (COUGH)
          Tell Scarlet I do give a damn...
          I... I... UUG!
           
          And the Mask gives up the ghost, his pink tongue flops out the 
          side of his mouth. Eddy bursts into tears.
           
          Suddenly a huge cartoon AUDIENCE pops up silhouetted in the 
          foreground, applauding wildly. An off-camera ARM shoots into 
          frame handing 
          the Mask an Oscar.
           
          The Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Thank you! You love me! You
          really love me!
           
          Dorian pulls out his own .45 and opens fire.
           
          The Mask starts HOOTING laughter and ricochets off the dance 
          floor.
           
          Dorian gives chase, but suddenly the nightclub doors are KICKED 
          OPEN and Kellaway and a squad of police burst into the room with 
          THEIR 
          guns drawn.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Drop it, Tyrel!
           
          Dorian lets his .45 CLATTER to the ground. Kellaway retrieves it.
           
          DORIAN
          Hello, Kellaway. You got a
          warrant or did you just drop by
          for a night cap?
           
          KELLAWAY
          I got probable cause. A couple
          of your boys were spotted knocking
          over Edge City Bank.
           
          One of his men begins to roughly frisk Dorian
           
          DORIAN
          Easy, junior. You're givin' me
          a woodey.
           
          KELLWAY
          One of them was wearin' some kind
          of big green mask.
           
          DORIAN
          For once you're on the right
          track, but that's not one of my
          men. Maybe you ought to try a
          little actual police work instead
          of this harassment bullshit.
           
          KELLAWAY
          This isn't harassment. You want
          to see some harassment?
          (to his men)
          Search the place, boys.
           
          His men begin to tear the club apart.
           
          DORIAN
          Ever wonder why you didn't make
          Captain, asshole? I got friends
          so high up they'd give you a nose
          bleed.
           
          Kellaway hauls off and CRACKS him in the face with a solid right 
          cross.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Well what d'ya know? I guess they
          gave you one too.
           
          Dorian shakes it off and glares at him.
           
          DORIAN
          (SOFTLY)
          You're a dead man.
           
          One of the officers now appears on the stairway.
           
          OFFICER
          Lt., we got a stiff upstairs.
          One of the guys from the heist.
           
          KELLAWAY
          (cuffs him)
          Better call that high-priced
          lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're
          comin' downtown.
           
          DORIAN
          I'll be back on the streets before
          sunrise and you know it.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Then just think of this as the
          city's way of showing you a little
          hospitality.
          (pats him on the cheek)
          I'll stop by to tuck you in
          myself.
           
          As the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on 
          the dance floor.
           
          CLOSER
           
          Kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the 
          Mask's tie and inspects it closely... It's the same fabric 
          Kellaway saw Stalney 
          wearing that morning.
           
          EXT. CLUB
           
          Kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina. Flattened 
          into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the 
          Mask. The eyes 
          follow Kellaway as he speaks to TWO COPS guarding the door.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You're on your own, boys.
           
          COP
          Don't worry, Lt. If he's in
          there, well get him.
           
          Kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket.
           
          KELLAWAY
          And if he's not, I got a
          feeling I know where to find him.
           
          As Kellaway heads for his car, the Mask slips out of the poster 
          (still flat as a pancake), slides along the wall behind 
          unsuspecting policemen 
          and around the corner to safety.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - DAWN
           
          Milo GROWLS, Frisbee in mouth. Stanley wakes up with a massive 
          headache and dark rings under his eyes. The Mask, which lies on 
          the pillow 
          next to him is taking a greater and greater toll. There's a 
          BANGING on the door.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)
          Police. Open up.
           
          Stanley runs to the closet to hide the Mask. The instant he opens 
          the door, an avalanche of CASH pours out, suffocating him.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh my god!
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)
          Ipkiss! I know you're in there.
           
          Stanley grabs the Frisbee and starts shoveling the money back 
          into the closet. Now the doorbell starts RINGING.
           
          STANLEY
          All right, I'm coming!
           
          Stanley tosses the Mask and the Frisbee into the closet and SLAMS 
          it shut. He scoops up a few stray dollars and throws them under 
          the bed.
           
          He hurries to the door and opens it, an easy smile on his face.
           
          STANLEY
          Lieutenant, what a surprise! What
          can I do for you?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You can answer a few questions.
           
          STANLEY
          I've got to get ready for work.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Trust me. Your bank's opening
          late today.
           
          Kellaway steps into the apartment, without waiting for an 
          invitation. Stanley glances nervously back at the closet. Milo is 
          scratching at the door.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Where were you last night?
           
          STANLEY
          Here... mostly. Is something
          wrong?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe
          it's all just a crazy coincidence
          that this so called "Mask"
          character always seems to be
          wherever you are.
           
          STANLEY
          Mask -- who?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Don't insult my intelligence,
          Ipkiss. First, he's spotted in
          your building, then the bank where
          you work and now I find this at
          the Monkey's Paw.
           
          He displays the TORN PIECE OF FABRIC. It matches the piece 
          missing in Stanley's pajamas. Stanley wilts.
           
          Milo YAPS and leaps up, trying to open the closet door.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo. No!
          (moves the dog away)
          Okay, so I went out on the town
          last night. A guy's got to have
          a little fun.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          In your jammies?
           
          Milo is back at the closet door. He's just about got it open as 
          Stanley turns the detective to the door.
           
          STANLEY
          Naw, I just took 'em with me in
          case I didn't make it home. I
          don't know about you, Lieutenant.
          But I've got a pretty good track
          record with the ladies.
           
          Kellaway pulls away from Stanley and begins suspiciously SNIFFING 
          the air around him.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Wait a second... you smell that?
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          KELLAWAY
          (SNIFFS)
          Bullshit. I hate the smell of
          bullshit. Don't even think about
          leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be
          in touch.
           
          Kellaway SLAMS the front door, just as the closet door falls open 
          -- spilling all the cash. Milo happily snatches his Frisbee. 
          Stanley sinks back 
          down on his bed.
           
          STANLEY
          What are we gonna do, Milo? What
          are we gonna do?
           
          C.U. - VIDEO MONITOR
           
          A replay of the bank robbery, from the bank's grainy videocams. A 
          blurred image of the Mask is visible as he zig-zags around the 
          bank at high 
          speed.
           
          WIDER
           
          Kellaway sips a cup of brackish coffee as Oliveras FREEZE-FRAMES 
          the best image of the Mask. There's a wild-eyed look of glee on 
          his face as 
          he stuffs sacks full of money.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          I don't know, boss. That's one
          helluva rubber mask.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Where's the lab report?
           
          Oliveras hands it over.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          We got fingerprints on some of
          the currency, but nothing matches
          Tyrel's men. Looks like this guy
          beat 'em to the punch.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Get the bank's employee files and
          run down the prints on a guy named
          Ipkiss.
           
          DEPUTY OLIVERAS
          You figure it was an inside job?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Yeah, and all I need is a couple
          of prints to lock this wack job
          up 'till doomsday.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE - DAY
           
          Dorian's assembled a war council. At the table are Sweet Eddy and 
          assorted Button Men from the city's underworld. An open attache 
          case filled 
          with stacks of money sits before Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          A fifty thousand dollar reward
          to the man who finds this "Mask"
          character before the cops do.
          Get the word out to every street
          hustler and low life in this town.
          (pounds his fist)
          I want him here. In my office.
          Alive. By tomorrow! Now get
          going!
           
          Everybody scrambles out of their seats.
           
          Tina sits in the corner of the room, painting her nails. She 
          glances up at Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          What are you looking at?
           
          TINA
          You. You're losing it Dorian.
           
          DORIAN
          I'm losing nothing. Except maybe
          some extra baggage I don't need
          around here.
           
          TINA
          What's that supposed to mean?
           
          DORIAN
          You weren't putting up much of
          a fight when that green goon
          kissed you last night.
           
          TINA
          C'mon, did it look to you like
          I had a choice?
           
          DORIAN
          Maybe you did and maybe you
          didn't, but I know this, one day
          real soon I'm gonna run this town
          and when I do there's gonna be
          payback for anyone who crossed
          me.
          (glares at her)
          I mean anyone.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. BANK - DAY
           
          The place is in general disarray but still functioning, jammed 
          with worried depositors. Stanley makes his way to his desk, his 
          face pale and 
          unshaven. Dark circles ring his eyes.
           
          MR. DICKEY
          Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our
          hands here and you stroll in over
          an hour late. If I have to put
          up with your slovenly...
           
          Stanley develops an odd facial TWITCH, then...
           
          STANLEY
          (EXPLODES)
          Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell
          your daddy how you're running this
          branch like it's your own personal
          piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw
          some of those files we could
          arrange a little vacation for you
          at Club Fed!
           
          Dickey is absolutely shocked into silence by this outburst, 
          then...
           
          MR. DICKEY
          That will be all, Ipkiss.
           
          Dickey turns on his heels and exits. Charlie Schumacher now 
          appears glowing with new respect for Stanley.
           
          CHARLIE
          Woah! What side of who's bed did
          you wake up on?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm not sure.
          (TWITCHES)
          I haven't exactly been myself
          lately.
           
          For a split second, Stanley's entire face CONTORTS into an 
          alarming Mask-like expression.
           
          CHARLIE
          (WARILY)
          Yeah, well you look like you
          could use a little R and R there
          buddy... and as a matter of fact
          I've got just the ticket. Or
          should I say tickets?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm afraid to ask.
           
          Charlie flashes two tickets.
           
          CHARLIE
          Saturday night. Grand opening
          of the Valhalla Casino. Serious
          skirt alert. Everybody who's
          anybody will be there. What do
          you say?
           
          STANELY
          I don't know Charlie, I...
           
          Stanley suddenly spots Tina making her way across the room to his 
          desk.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Excuse me a second.
           
          ANGLE ON STANLEY'S DESK
           
          STANLEY
          Tina... What are you doing here?
           
          TINA
          I heard about the robbery. I
          guess I just wanted to make sure
          you were okay.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, don't worry about me.
          (TWITCHES)
          I'm fine.
           
          TINA
          Are you sure? You look a
          little...
           
          STANLEY
          I'm just having a little trouble
          sleeping is all.
          (BEAT)
          I guess you won't want to open
          that account after all this...
           
          TINA
          I'm not so sure I'll have much
          to open an account with anymore.
           
          STANLEY
          What about the nightclub? I
          thought you were doing great.
           
          TINA
          I don't know how much longer I
          can stay there Stanley. Things
          are getting a little intense.
           
          STANLEY
          Well, there must be plenty of
          other places you could sing.
          Maybe even get a record deal...
           
          TINA
          I wish it was that easy. There's
          thousands of girls out there just
          like me who...
           
          STANLEY
          Not just like you. You've got
          a voice like... like an angel.
           
          TINA
          (lights a cigarette)
          An angel huh? That's the first
          time I've heard that one.
           
          STANLEY
          No, I mean it. You really do.
           
          TINA
          I can vamp my way through a tune.
          But that's not really singing.
           
          STANLEY
          What is it with you, Tina? Why
          don't you believe in yourself?
           
          TINA
          (SIGHS)
          I guess I've just heard a lot of
          promises from a lot of guys. In
          the end they all wanted the same
          thing and it wasn't a song.
           
          STANLEY
          So maybe you've been singing for
          the wrong guys.
           
          TINA
          I'm not so sure there's any other
          kind. Not for me, anyway.
          (RISES)
          Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt.
           
          STANLEY
          Yeah.
           
          TINA
          What about this guy, the Mask?
          Do the cops have a line on him?
           
          STANLEY
          I'm not sure. Why are you
          interested?
           
          TINA
          Promise you won't say anything?
           
          STANLEY
          Sure.
           
          TINA
          He came to the club last night
          and he was just so... well,
          different. I haven't been able
          to get him off my mind.
           
          STANLEY
          Really? They say he's pretty
          weird looking.
           
          TINA
          Yeah. He's ugly... but he's kinda
          cool... y'know, like Mick Jagger.
           
          STANLEY
          You really think so?
           
          TINA
          Yeah. If you hear anything about
          him, would you call me at the
          club?
           
          Stanley nods - unsure of what to say. Tina opens the door, but 
          before she exits...
           
          STANLEY
          Actually... I sort of know the
          guy.
           
          TINA
          What?
           
          STANLEY
          The Mask. We're - old college
          buddies him and I.
           
          TINA
          Are you serious?
           
          STANLEY
          Oh yeah. To tell you the truth,
          I'm sorta covering for him on this
          bank thing. He's not such a bad
          guy, really. He just gets a
          little carried away.
           
          TINA
          I'll say. Do you think you could
          give him a message?
           
          STANLEY
          I suppose so.
           
          TINA
          Tell him I want to see him again
           
          STANLEY
          When? I mean, I'd need to tell
          him exactly.
           
          TINA
          How about seven o'clock tonight
          at Peninsula Park.
           
          STANLEY
          I'll be... I mean, I'll make sure
          he's there.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - GARAGE - AFTERNOON
           
          Peggy parks her car in her space, locks it up and beeps on the 
          car horn.
           
          When she turns, she notices a shadowy FIGURE watching her from a 
          bark corner of the garage.
           
          She hurries down the row of parked cars, clutching her purse to 
          her side.
           
          The figure follows at a slow but relentless pace.
           
          Peggy fumbles for her keys, finally finds the correct one and 
          enters the building.
           
          INT. APARTMENT HALL
           
          Peggy is relieved as she reaches her apartment door and slips the 
          key in the lock... but the lock is jammed.
           
          She tries and tries again... nothing. Suddenly, a hand enters 
          frame and SLAPS an eviction notice on her door.
           
          LANDLORD
          Sorry, doll. I had the locks
          changed this afternoon.
           
          PEGGY
          You what? You can't do that!
           
          LANDLORD
          You've known we're going condo
          for six months, Peggy. I can't
          stall the owner a minute longer.
          Either you pony up the downpayment
          or you're out.
           
          PEGGY
          Just a couple more days, Phil.
          The paper's ready to give me a
          full time job.
           
          LANDLORD
          I've heard that one before.
           
          PEGGY
          C'mon, at least let me get a few
          of my things.
           
          Phil considers this a beat, then unlocks the door for her.
           
          LANDLORD
          Don't make me regret this. We
          get a certified check by noon
          tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort
          you out of here.
           
          PEGGY
          Thanks Phil. You're a sweetheart.
           
          Phil exits. Peggy picks up her things when she hears an off-
          camera "Pssst." She turns.
           
          THE FIGURE
           
          stands in the shadows by the fire escape. He's got a voice that 
          sounds like he's been gargling glass.
           
          THE FIGURE
          I heard you were lookin' for a
          story.
           
          PEGGY
          Who... Who are you?
           
          THE FIGURE
          Just a guy with a little
          information lookin' to make a
          buck. But maybe I heard wrong.
          You don't look like much of a
          reporter to me.
           
          Peggy gulps back her fear, determined to live up to her job.
           
          PEGGY
          You give me something worth
          printing and I'll get you your
          money. What's this about?
           
          FIGURE
          The guy they call the Mask and
          why Dorian Tyrel's willing to pay
          fifty large to get him.
           
          PEGGY
          How do I find this Tyrel?
           
          FIGURE
          Careful, sweet meat. You break
          this story and he just might find
          you.

          Dorian and Sweet Eddy casually step through the front door of the 
          restaurant's ersatz chalet facade.
           
          INT. SMORGASBORD
           
          Sweet Eddy takes a position by the door as Dorian greets Artie 
          the Swede at a large oak table in the festeively decorated 
          SMORGASBORD
           
          The Swede is flanked by his gunsels as he's served by a big 
          blonde waitress in a classic peasant girl costume.
           
          SWEDE
          Dorian... thanks for coming by,
          kid.
           
          DORIAN
          My pleasure, Swede. It's been
          too long. I was worried you were
          still pissed about that little
          thing with Harry the Hat.
           
          SWEDE
          That? It was nothing. He was
          a pain in my ass anyway. Here,
          sit down, sit down.
           
          DORIAN
          Congratulations on the new casino.
           
          SWEDE
          Thanks, but it might be a little
          early to celebrate. As a
          matter of fact that's why I asked
          you to stop by.
           
          DORIAN
          Is that right?
           
          SWEDE
          Here... have a little something
          to eat. That's Svenska meatballs,
          kid. The real thing.
           
          DORIAN
          Thanks.
           
          Dorian starts to eat.
           
          SWEDE
          So, I tell you Dorian, it's a
          terrible shame. I put all my hard
          work into this beautiful casino
          and what do you think? All the
          sudden I got all kinda problems
          with the city. Big problems.
          The whole deal could fold.
           
          DORIAN
          Maybe I can help you out. I'm
          expecting to come into a little
          investment capital shortly. If
          worse comes to worse and you
          really need to bail out...
           
          SWEDE
          What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy
          a sweetheart? Thanks for the
          offer Dorian, but I think maybe
          I can solve this myself.
           
          DORIAN
          Is that right?
           
          SWEDE
          That's right. You know that
          Councilman you got in your pocket?
           
          Dorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth. 
          He notices a PINK CARNATION squashed into the gravy.
           
          SWEDE (CONT.)
          Well now you've got 'im in your
          mouth. How you like that?
           
          The Swede and his men have a good laugh as Dorian spits out his 
          meatball. The Swede pulls a gun and jams it under Dorian's chin.
           
          Sweet Eddy goes for his gun, but one of the Swede's men pops up, 
          jamming a barrel to his temple.
           
          SWEDE (CONT.)
          (to Dorian)
          Now listen close scumbag! You
          want to bw in business with me?
          Okay, we're partners now. I'm
          takin' fifty per cent off the
          Monkey's Paw. You screw with me
          again and I'll send you straight
          down to Hell with your scumbag
          councilman. You can apologize
          for eatin' him for lunch.
           
          DORIAN
          Sure, Swede. Take it easy.
           
          SWEDE
          Good. Now get out of my sight.
           
          Dorian rises.
           
          SWEDE
          Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets
          to my grand opening. Stop by.

          He starts to turn away when he notices an ad on the back of the 
          paper for a book... "The Masks We Wear" by Dr. Arthur Neuman, the 
          SAME 
          man we saw interviewed on "The Larry King Show." The byline reads 
          "The Mysterious Powers of the Identities Within Us."

          changes you into a different
          person?
           
          STANLEY
          Yes!
          (face twitches)
          It's turning me into some kind
          of lunatic!
          (briefly CONTORTS into a Mask expression)
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Mr. Ipkiss, please. This is just
          obsessional dellusion. What you
          have here is nothing more than
          a piece of wood.
           
          STANELY
          But your book says masks...
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          My book uses masks as a metaphor
          for our complex personalities.
          The masks we must present to the
          outside world... to suppress the
          id. To protect our innermost
          desires.
           
          STANELY
          Yeah, well this one works in
          reverse.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          You're going to have to be willing
          to work on this delusion or...
           
          STANLEY
          It's not a delusion! Alright,
          I'll prove it to you if I have
          to, but I won't be responsible
          for the consequences.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Mr. Ipkiss please! There is no
          such thing as a magical mask.
           
          STANLEY
          (holds up mask)
          Last chance to hide all dangerous
          objects.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Alright then, go on. You're not
          going to frighten me.
           
          Stanley takes a deep breath and shoves the mask onto his face.
           
          STANLEY
          Whooooooooaaaaa...
           
          He starts spinning around.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Whoa, what?
           
          Stanley just stands there like an idiot. Nothing happened. He 
          tries it again. Same result.
           
          STANLEY
          It didn't work?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Does that surprise you? The mask
          is nothing but a reflection of
          you - the inner you.
           
          Stanley isn't listening. He's thinking out load.
           
          STANLEY
          It worked last night. And the
          night before. Maybe it only works
          at night... What kind of mask
          did you say this was.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Scandinavian. It looks like a
          representation of Loki, the Norse
          God of Mischief. He supposedly
          caused so much trouble that Odin
          banished him from Valhalla
          forever.
           
          STANLEY
          (GASPS)
          What if he banished him... into
          a mask?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          (SIGHS)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Ipkiss, we're out
          of time.
           
          STANLEY
          But what should I do about my date?
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Your date?
           
          STANLEY
          You know. Tonight. The park.
          Tina. Do I go as myself of the
          Mask?
           
          Dr. Neuman puts an arm around Stanley and leads him to the door.
           
          DR. NEUMAN
          Mr. Ipkiss, please. Haven't you
          been listening to anything I've
          been saying? Go as yourself.
          And as the Mask.
          (a beat)
          Because they are the one and the same,
          beautiful person
           
          Stanley sees this is a losing battle. He turns and walks out.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. FORD TAURUS - DAY
           
          Lt. Kellaway sits in this unmarked police car, finishing up 
          lunch. The police band comes on. Kellaway grabs it.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Yeah?
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          I've got that cross-check from
          the bank files.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          And?
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          It's Ipkiss, Alright. Stanley
          Ipkiss.
           
          Kellaway smiles to himself. At that moment -
           
          STANLEY
           
          comes out of Dr. Neuman's office building. He gets in his car and 
          drives off.
           
          OLIVERAS (V.O.)
          You want us to pick him up?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Don't do a thing until I tell you.
          Just keep the SWAT team standing
          by. If this guy's half as bad
          as he's supposed to be we'll need
          all the help we can get.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
           
          fires up his engine and pulls away.
           
          EXT. PARK - SUNSET
           
          Topiaried ivy reads: "Welcome to Peninsula Park." A small sign 
          below that reads: "No dumping."
           
          Carrying his briefcase, Stanley enters the park.
           
          EXT. BENCH
           
          Stanley passes through a stand of trees and nearly bumps into 
          Tina.
           
          TINA
          Stanley, what are you doing here?
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early.
           
          TINA
          A little.
           
          STANLEY
          I just... wanted to make sure you
          two got together okay.
           
          TINA
          That's nice.
          (sits down)
          You know, I hardly ever stop by
          here. It's hard to believe it
          was just a garbage heap.
           
          STANLEY
          (looking at the sky)
          It's always beautiful at sunset.
          Those methane emissions really
          pick up the colors.
           
          TINA
          Wow. They really do. All those
          pinks and greens.
           
          STANLEY
          Well... I'm sure my cousin will
          be along any minute. He never
          shows up anywhere 'till after
          sundown. He's sort of strange
          that way.
          (RISES)
          I guess I'll get going.
           
          TINA
          No, Stanley. Stay for a second.
          I was thinking about what you said
          and I, uh, I want you to know I
          appreciate it. Maybe you're
          right. If I believed in myself
          a little more I wouldn't rely on
          guys like Dorian.
           
          STANLEY
          Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel?
           
          TINA
          Yeah. He's sort of my manager.
           
          STANLEY
          Tina, you've got to be careful
          of that guy. He's a dangerous
          criminal.
           
          TINA
          You really mean that, don't you?
           
          STANLEY
          Absolutely. You ought to hear
          the stories...
           
          TINA
          No, I mean, you're really worried
          about me. That's... real sweet,
          Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          C'mon, Tina this is serious. How
          involved are you with this guy?
           
          TINA
          I can take care of myself,
          Stanley. I always have.
           
          STANLEY
          Oh, really? People close to Tyrel
          have a nasty habit of turning up
          dead, or haven't you noticed?
           
          TINA
          Look, this may sound a little cold
          but I do what I have to do to get
          by, okay? I'm nobody in this town
          without Dorian.
           
          STANLEY
          And who are you with him Tina?
          I'm not exactly sure who I am
          anymore but at least I'm trying
          to find out. If you really had
          any faith in yourself, you
          wouldn't be hanging on to some
          kind of free ride.
           
          That last bit stung, and Stanley knows it. A shadow falls over 
          them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          (SIGHS)
          I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better
          get going.
           
          Stanley gets up and hurries off through the trees.
           
          TINA
          (RISES)
          Stanley... wait!
           
          But he's already disappeared. Tina starts to follow after when 
          she hears a strange WHOOOSH. A whirlwind begins to kick up the 
          leaves all 
          around her.
           
          The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory 
          and literally sweeps her off her feet. With his lower lip thrust 
          out he romances 
          Tina in a deep syrupy French voice.
           
          THE MASK
          Cher! Ce moi! Je'taime, Je'
          taime, Je any old tame! At last
          we are together mon petite bon
          bon!
           
          ANGLE ON THE BUSHES
           
          Kellaway, Doyle, and two other officers are watching from a 
          distance. He speaks into his walkie talkie in hushed tones.
           
          KELLAWAY
          This is Kellaway. I need back
          up and I need it now! Every
          available man down to Peninsula
          Park.
           
          INT. NEWSROOM - BULLPEN
           
          MURRAY, an old timer newshound hurries into the room, grabs his
          notebook and pulls on his coat.
           
          MURRAY
          Looks like it's gonna be a long
          night. My wife is gonna kill me.
           
          PEGGY
          What is it, Murray?
           
          MURRAY
          The cops got your pal Ipkiss
          staked out at Peninsula Park.
          We just picked it up over the
          police band.
           
          PEGGY
          Let me cover it, Murray! You go
          on home to Claire.
           
          MURRAY
          I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey
          said...
           
          PEGGY
          (grabs her coat)
          I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks
          a million. I owe you one.
           
          She gives Murray a quick peck on the cheek and runs out the door.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. PENINSULA PARK
           
          The Mask is all over Tina like a cheap suit, stroking her hair 
          grabbing her bod. She's definitely having second thoughts about 
          him as he backs 
          her up to the bench.
           
          THE MASK
          Our love is like a red red rose,
          and I'm feeling so thorny already,
          I'd like to nip you in the bud!
           
          She ducks his grab, but he recovers smoothly, flipping out a pack 
          of cigarettes. He pops one in her mouth.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Cigarette?
           
          His hand is a blur of motion as he sticks dozens of cigarettes in 
          her mouth.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Regular? Menthol? Filter?
          Cigar? Cigarette? Tiparillo?
           
          He produces a huge blow torch from within his jacket and pops on 
          the flame.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          Let me get that for you!
           
          He grabs the gigantic wad of cigarettes as if they were one, puts 
          them in his own mouth and applies the blow torch. With one mighty 
          SSSUCK 
          he smokes them all down to gray ash.
           
          Beat.
           
          The ash tumbles away.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          (exhales a huge cloud of smoke)
          Aaaaaah. And now... amore!
           
          He throws his arms wide and lunges at Tina.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Freeze!
           
          The Mask freezes in mid-air, arms outstretched and feet suspended 
          off the ground.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Put your hands up!
           
          The Mask's lips barely move as he speaks in a tiny voice out the 
          side of his mouth.
           
          THE MASK
          But eu 'tol me 'oo freeze!
           
          KELLAWAY
          Alright, alright. Unfreeze!
          You're under arrest!
           
          The Mask instantly drops to the ground and throws himself into 
          wildly exaggerated expressions of remorse and pain.
           
          THE MASK
          Under arrest! My god! The Law!
          I knew I'd forgotten something!
          (TEARS)
          I was so young! So foolish! So
          full of life!
           
          Tears are gushing from Stanley/Mask's eyes like twin water taps. 
          He puts his hands out and Kellaway slaps on the cuffs.
           
          THE MASK (CONT.)
          What... What'll they do with me,
          Sarge?
           
          KELLAWAY
          Sorry, son. That's not my
          department. Search him!
           
          Doyle reaches into the Mask's zoot suit and starts tossing stuff 
          on the ground.
           
          DOYLE
          Comb - Flintstones vitamins -
          Sousaphone - Bazooka -
          (PAUSE)
          picture of Kellaway's wife...
           
          Kellaway looks down at the photo. It really IS a picture of his 
          wife with a handwritten note: "Call me, lover - 555-1234!"
           
          KELLAWAY
          What the --?
          (PAUSE)
          Margaret!
           
          Furious, Kellaway LUNGES at Stanley/Mask's neck. Two other 
          officers restrain him.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You son of a bitch -- !
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Jeez, I figured you had a sense
          of humor!
          (PAUSE)
          After all, you married her!
           
          Stanley/Mask honks Kellaway's nose which makes a loud AHOOGA 
          noise and runs for it.
           
          Kellaway starts to follow, but discovers he's now handcuffed to 
          Doyle.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Get him!
           
          The other police officers draw their guns and give chase as 
          Stanley RICOCHETS off through the trees hooting laughter.
           
          EXT. PARK ENTRANCE
           
          A twelve foot high stone wall surrounds the park. Stanley/Mask 
          races through the entryway, SLAMMING the park's huge wooden gates 
          behind him.
           
          CLOSER - THE GATE
           
          The Mask throws an iron bolt, SNAPS on a huge padlock, SLAMS down 
          a steel plate ZZZIPS up a gigantic zipper, HAMMERS in dozens of 
          nails at high speed and throws himself against the gate 
          panting...
           
          But then his eyes BUG OUT on stalks as he sees what lies on the 
          opposite side of the gate.
           
          STANLEY'S P.O.V.
           
          COPS... more COPS than seems humanly possible. They're in cars, 
          armed antipersonnel carriers, hanging from trees, parachuting 
          FROM 
          helicopters...
           
          And they're all aiming serious looking guns at HIM.
           
          BULLHORN VOICE
          It's all over! Put your hands
          over your head or we'll open fire.
           
          Stanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out 
          of this mess - then -
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Hit it!
           
          With that, a police SPOTLIGHT SNAPS on, and the brightly lit park 
          entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage. Stanley/Mask strikes a 
          pose, 
          now wearing a straw hat "boater" and weilding a cane.
           
          Pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as 
          a RUMBA begins playing from every speaker in town. 
          Stanley/Mask SWAYS seductively in time to the music.
           
          A FEMALE COP steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over 
          her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song.
           
          FEMALE COP
          They rave about Sloppy Joe - the
          Latin lothario - but Havana -
          has a new sensation.
           
          It's "Cuban Pete RUMBA" by Desi Arnaz! (Yes, this is a real 
          song!)
           
          FEMALE COP (CONT.)
          He's really a modest guy -
          although he's the hottest guy -
          in HavAAAAna - and here's what
          he has to saaaay -
           
          Stanley/Mask steps up to the "stage" and tilts the boater over 
          his eyes, casting a sly glance toward the crowd.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          ("Latin" voice)
          They call me Cuban Pete - I'm
          King of the Rumba beat - every
          time I play the maracas I go chick
          chick chickie boom!
           
          Gene Kelly on acid, Stanley/Mask punctuates his number with any 
          number of sly gestures - winking, nodding, sliding seductively 
          down a 
          street lamp post, doing repeated "splits" on the sidewalk - it's 
          his big number!
           
          The cops watch this with open mouthed astonishment.
           
          ANGLE ON STONE WALL
           
          Kellaway climbs over two of his men to scale the wall. He can't 
          believe his eyes. Doyle clamors up beside him.
           
          DOYLE
          Hey, he's not bad.
           
          Kellaway shoots him a dirty look.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
           
          waltzes into the street, prancing just inches from the heavily 
          armed cops. His legs twine around each other like spaghetti, then 
          his upper torso 
          SPINS until they're straightened out again.
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          (still singing)
          Yessir, I'm Cuban Pete! The craze
          of my native street! When I start
          to dance everything goes chick
          chick chickie boom!
           
          Like some weird, loony case of mass hypnosis, Stanley/Mask waits 
          for the "musical break" to coax the armed cops into JOINING him 
          on the 
          number - as the rough and tumble equivalent of CHORUS GIRLS!
           
          ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN FROM HELICOPTER
           
          The street takes the look of a Busby Berkeley musical as the cops 
          HIGH STEP in time to the infectious RUMBA beat.
           
          EXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT
           
          Kellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and 
          scrambles to his feet. He can't believe his eyes. His cops, his 
          tac squad, his 
          friggin' SWAT team - they're ALL in the street, dancing with this 
          crazy maniac!
           
          Stanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female SWAT officer, 
          "dirty dancing" her across the street -
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          The senoritas they sing, and how
          they sling their sombreros --!
          (It's very nice! So full of
          SPIIIIICE--)
          (dip!)
          And when they're dancing they
          bring a happy ring to their
          vaqueros - they sing their song,
          all the day loonnnggg -
           
          Doyle crash lands beside Kellaway and starts out to join the 
          others, but Kellaway grabs him by the back of his jacket.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You go out there and I'll blow
          your brains out!
           
          Furious, Kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car, 
          pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air. The sharp REPORT 
          AND 
          stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music 
          suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away from the 
          CHORUS 
          line, looking confused.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          Goddamn it! Arrest that thing!
           
          The cops - shaken back to reality - fumble for their weapons.
           
          THROUGH THE SMOKE
           
          The Mask takes off - dashing into the crowd.
           
          KELLAWAY
           
          spots the Mask and races after him, calling his men.
           
          KELLAWAY (CONT.)
          This way!
           
          THE MASK
           
          bumps into an OLD LADY who SCREAMS at his hideousness.
           
          The Mask realizes how obvious he is. He turns away and brings his 
          arms to his head. There's a RIPPPING sound. And when he turns 
          around, 
          the Mask has now transformed back into...
           
          STANLEY
           
          Carrying the mask, Stanley tries to blend in with the crowd.
           
          KELLAWAY
           
          followed by a handfull of officers bears down on him.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Halt! Halt or we'll shoot!
           
          Stanley quickly cuts down...
           
          A NARROW ALLEY
           
          Stanley races down the lane - cops hot on his trail. Bullets 
          EXPLODE all around him. Just as he reaches the next street...
           
          A CAR
           
          screeches to a halt - almost running Stanley over. The window 
          rolls down revealing...
           
          PEGGY BRANDT
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley! Get in!
           
          Stanley jumps into the passenger seat.
           
          INT. PEGGY'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
           
          Peggy rips around the bend, easily outdistancing the cops.
           
          STANLEY
          Thanks. Where are we going?
           
          PEGGY
          Someplace where we'll be safe.
           
          EXT. DAILY TRIBUNE BUILDING - NIGHT
           
          The streets are empty.
           
          INT. NEWS SHIPPING ROOM - NIGHT
           
          Stanley and Peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast 
          shadowy shipping room. In the b.g., a huge machine spews out 
          hundreds of 
          newspapers on an assembly line. Everything's mechanized: 
          printing, folding, wrapping.
           
          Peggy hands Stanley a cup of coffee. He's a complete wreck, 
          clothes disheveled, rings under his eyes.
           
          PEGGY
          I saw it. I saw the whole thing.
          What's happening to you, Stanley?
           
          STANLEY
          It's crazy... I've lost all
          control. When I put on this mask
          I can do anything... be anything,
          but it's ruining my life.
           
          PEGGY
          Stanley, I don't know what's
          happening to you, but I do know
          this. That letter you sent my
          column was from a guy with more
          guts and heart than any of the
          creeps I've met in Edge City.
          Whatever this mask is, you don't
          need it. You... Stanley Ipkiss,
          are already all you ever need to
          be.
           
          STANLEY
          Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean
          that?
           
          PEGGY
          (PAUSES)
          Actually... no.
           
          STANLEY
          What?
           
          We now hear a door open and footsteps.
           
          PEGGY
          (RISES)
          What took you guys so long? I've
          been vamping here for twenty
          minutes.
           
          Dorian and three of his men stand there with their guns trained 
          on Stanley.
           
          DORIAN
          This is him?
           
          PEGGY
          You have the fifty thou?
           
          Sweet Eddy FLICKS open a briefcase lined with cash.
           
          PEGGY (CONT.)
          Right. When he puts on the mask
          he becomes that green thingamajig.
           
          STANLEY
          (still dumbfounded)
          Peggy, what are you doing?
           
          PEGGY
          Sorry, Stanley. You really are
          a great guy, but I just can't lose
          my condo. You know how hard it
          is to find an apartment in this
          city.
           
          Sweet Eddy and a second thug grab Stanley and hang him over the 
          steel maw of the whirring news press.
           
          DORIAN
          Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money
          from the heist?
           
          STANLEY
          My aparment. It's in my
          apartment!
           
          DORIAN
          Thanks. Now I believe you have
          a pressing engagement.
           
          PEGGY
          Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt
          him!
           
          Dorian toys with the wooden mask, enjoying his control over the 
          situation.
           
          DORIAN
          You're right. Easy boys. One
          thing at a time. Tell me about
          this mask, Ipkiss. How does it
          work?
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know... You just put it
          on!
           
          The Mask FX theme builds, Dorian raises the mask to his face.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Better be careful, boss.
           
          With a CRACK of thunder a whirlwind of light and power swirls 
          around Dorian's figure. Unlike Stanley's transformation, Dorian's 
          is much more 
          diabolical. He grows and changes within a nimbus of ROARING 
          light. Finally the light dies away and Dorian/Mask rises from a 
          circle of swirling 
          smoke.
           
          C.U. DORIAN/MASK
           
          While Stanley was a zoot suited bee-bopper in hyper-drive, 
          Dorian/Mask is more like a hulking evil GENIE, fresh out of the 
          lamp and pissed at 
          the world. His diamond earring and touches of his neuvo-gangster 
          look is still apparent, but his huge grin stretches out like a 
          TYRANNOSAURUS 
          Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power. His voice is 
          a deep inhuman RUMBLE.
           
          DORIAN
          What a rush.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Whoa, boss... are you okay?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          I'm better than ever, you idiot.
          Now stop the presses. There'll
          be a new headline tonight.
           
          Sweet Eddy stands there looking disappointed with Ipkiss still 
          held dangling above the churning presses.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          But what about him?
           
          Dorian/Mask wheels about and ROARS at Sweet Eddy.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          DO AS I SAY! I have other plans
          for Ipkiss. Everything's become
          so clear to me now!
           
          Peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase.
           
          PEGGY
          Ah... excuse me. If you don't
          mind, I'll just take my money and
          be going. You guys make
          yourselves at home.
           
          Dorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Must you go? What a shame. You
          and I could make beautiful
          headlines together.
           
          Peggy removes his arm from her shoulder.
           
          PEGGY
          Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part
          of the deal.
           
          Peggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Of course. You only want what's
          coming to you, don't you?
           
          Peggy whips out a snub-nose .38 out from beneath her coat.
           
          PEGGY
          Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't
          born yesterday.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Ah... But you might die today!
           
          Dorian throws the switch and the presses CHURN to life. In a 
          flash he snatches Peggy off her feet.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          A girl like you deserves
          to have her face plastered all
          over page one.
           
          He tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper.
           
          CAMERA BOOMS DOWN as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses' 
          huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and 
          hydraulics to finally ENDFRAME on the chute where the newspapers 
          roll out on a conveyor belt.
           
          Headlines in blood red ink now read: "Reporter Killed in Freak 
          Accident" next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking 
          Peggy, her mouth open 
          in a silent scream.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          What do we do with Ipkiss?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          The police are looking for the
          Mask. We shall give them the
          Mask. And Eddy...
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Yeah, Dorian?
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Get the boys ready. The Swedes'
          expecting us at the casino opening
          tomorrow night. We wouldn't want
          to disappoint him, would we?
           
          Dorian/Mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep BOOMING 
          LAUGH. It's unnerving even to Eddy, but he laughs nervously in 
          RESPONSE 
          and elbows the other thugs to join in.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
           
          The door is kicked open and two of Dorian's henchmen burst into 
          the room. Milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the 
          curtains. They 
          yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into 
          plastic garbage bags.
           
          EXT. STREET - CAR
           
          Stanley lies in the back seat, gagged, bound hand and foot and 
          half hidden under a blanket. A thug in the driver's seat pokes 
          his .45 under 
          Stanley's nose.
           
          THUG
          That money better be where you
          said it was, Ipkiss or you can
          Ipkiss your ass goodbye.
           
          He chuckles at his own little joke.
           
          INT. APARTMENT
           
          Milo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish 
          their job. He ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window.
           
          MILO'S P.O.V.
           
          of the henchmen's car. Stanley can barely be seen peeking out the 
          car window. The henchmen pushes him back down.
           
          MILO
           
          His ears perk up. The boss is in trouble! He checks back outside 
          the curtain.
           
          THE HENCHMEN
           
          finish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags. Milo 
          races right by them, just out of sight.
           
          EXT. STREET
           
          The henchmen hop in and start the engine. As the car peels out 
          into traffic, Milo appears, valiantly racing along the sidewalk, 
          DODGING 
          pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the car in sight.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
           
          Dejected, Lt. Kellaway heads up the steps with Sgt. Doyle.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          I still can't believe it.
          Hardened cops dancin' in the
          streets... and broadcast all over
          the ten o'clock news.
           
          DOYLE
          The SWAT team got an offer to open
          for Wayne Newton.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          I'm history. The Captain's going
          to have my badge for breakfast.
          With a little pension on top.
           
          DOYLE
          C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your
          fault. Something will turn up.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Sure. Stanley Ipkiss is going
          to fall right into my lap...
           
          A car SCREECHES BY. The door flies open and a BODY comes tumbling 
          out - knocking Kellaway down. He looks up at the body sitting in 
          HIS 
          lap -
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          ...Ipkiss!
           
          STANLEY
          I can explain everything...
           
          DOYLE
          Don't bother.
           
          Doyle pulls a GREEN RUBBER MASK out of Stanley's pocket. Kellaway 
          starts hauling him up the precinct steps.
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          You have the right to remain
          silent, you freakin' Looney Tune.
          Anymore of your half-baked
          wisecracks can and will be used
          against you by me, personally...
           
          STANLEY
          You've got to listen to me!
           
          Kellaway and Doyle drag Stanley into the precinct - just as MILO 
          charges up. But the dog is shut out of the station.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
           
          Bruised, beaten and exhuasted - Stanley's thrown into a small 
          cell. The KEY-GUARD locks the cell up - then walks away.
           
          Stanley looks around his dismal quarters. A filthy toilet. The 
          cot even worse. There's a YOWLING. He climbs up on the cot and 
          looks out the 
          small, barred window.
           
          STANLEY'S P.O.V.:
           
          There's a dumpster below the window, overflowing with trash. Next 
          to the trash heap - is MILO. The dog looks up at Stanley and YIPS 
          happily. 
          Stanley forces a smile.
           
          STANLEY
          Go find yourself a new home, Milo.
          It looks like I'm going to be here
          for a long long time...
           
          Milo watches Stanley recede back into the cell.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - DAWN
           
          Stanley lies on his cot - staring at the ceiling. The Guard bangs 
          on the door.
           
          GUARD
          Wake up. You gotta visitor.
           
          STANLEY
          About time you found me a
          lawyer...
          (a beat)
          ...Tina?
           
          TINA
          Hello, Stanley.
           
          STANLEY
          What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick
          you out for not delivering me on
          schedule?
           
          TINA
          Is that what you think - that
          I set you up?
           
          STANLEY
          I don't know. But I've got plenty
          of time to figure it out.
           
          TINA
          You're just going to have to trust
          me on this.
           
          STANLEY
          Now is not the best time for
          me on trusting women.
           
          TINA
          I ran out on Dorian last night,
          Stanley. I just came to tell you
          I'm sorry. Sorry about
          everything.
           
          STANLEY
          You ran out on him?
           
          TINA
          That magic mask of yours turned
          him into some kind of monster...
           
          STANLEY
          He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa
          in the first place.
           
          TINA
          He's going to the casino opening
          tonight and he's planning to do
          something terrible.
           
          STANLEY
          A real change of pace for him.
           
          TINA
          Half this town will be there
          Stanley. I tried to tell the
          cops, but they wouldn't listen
          to me.
           
          STANLEY
          As long as he's got the mask,
          there's nothing they can do to
          stop him anyway. There's nothing
          anyone can do.
           
          TINA
          There must be some way. How does
          it work?
           
          STANLEY
          (PAUSES)
          It's like it brings you innermost
          desires to life. If deep down
          inside you're a little repressed
          and... a hopeless romantic, you
          become sort of a love-crazy wild
          man.
           
          TINA
          And if you've got a black heart?
           
          STANLEY
          Then the world's going to be a
          very dark place. And if I were
          you, I'd get out of town. Fast.
           
          Tina takes a beat and absorbs this information.
           
          TINA
          Thanks.
           
          STANLEY
          For what?
           
          TINA
          Lots of things. For really
          believing in me when I couldn't.
          For sharing a sunset with me.
          For being the first guy to treat
          me like I was a person instead
          of a slab of meat.
          (a beat)
          And for being any kind of
          romantic. Even a hopeless one.
           
          STANLEY
          (SOFTENING)
          You're welcome.
           
          TINA
          You know, that night at the club
          I knew I met someone special.
          Someone like nobody I'd ever met
          before.
           
          STANLEY
          The Mask.
           
          TINA
          No... the guy that was inside the Mask
          all the time. You. Stanley Ip -
           
          They draw closer. The iron bars scrunch up their faces...
           
          TINA (CONT.)
          --kiss.
           
          They KISS. A sweet, soft and romantic kiss. Then... the KEY-GUARD 
          pulls her away.
           
          KEY-GUARD
          Time's up, lady.
           
          TINA
          I've got to disappear for awhile
          Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll
          go but I'll let you know as soon
          as I can.
           
          Stanley takes a long last look at Tina as she's escorted out.
           
          EXT. STATION - DAY
           
          Warily, Tina slips out of the precinct. She's about to cross the 
          street, but spots a SUSPICIOUS LIMO, engine idling. Quickly, she 
          doubles back 
          and heads -
           
          INTO THE ALLEY
           
          Behind the station. She looks over her shoulder. No one's there. 
          Tina hurries toward the next street and -
           
          A BIG SEDAN
           
          roars up, cutting her off. She turns and runs back the way she 
          came - but freezes when THE LIMO screeches up, blocking her.
           
          Sweet Eddy and Hicks jump out of the limo. She SCREAMS.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S CELL - AT THE WINDOW - SAME TIME
           
          Stanley watches helplessly as Tina is dragged into the limo. 
          Frantic, Stanley runs to the cell door.
           
          STANLEY
          (to the Key-Guard)
          Hey! A girl's being kidnapped
          out there! Do something!
           
          THE GUARD tunrs up the volume on JEOPARDY, drowning Stanley out.
           
          EXT. DORIAN'S HOUSE - DAY
           
          A slick/modern house on the hills overlooking Edge City. Sweet 
          Eddy pulls Tina from the limo.
           
          INT. DORIAN'S HOUSE
           
          Sweet Eddy and Huey enter and push Tina roughly into the room. 
          Dorian rises to meet her.
           
          DORIAN
          (SARCASTICALLY)
          Baby, there you are...
          (he embraces her)
          I was gettin' all worried about
          you.
           
          TINA
          I just went out for a little while
          Dorian.
           
          Sweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder 
          bag he got from her car.
           
          DORIAN
          Looks like maybe a long little
          while, right baby?
           
          Dorian grabs her by the throat and SLAMS her against the wall. 
          The pictures rattle.
           
          DORIAN
          You know what happened to the last
          bitch that ran out on me? Do
          you?!
           
          TINA
          (CHOKING)
          No...
           
          DORIAN
          Nobody else does either. Nobody
          ever will.
           
          He tosses her onto the bed. She lies there gasping for breath.
           
          DORIAN
          Now fix yourself up, baby. And
          pick out something pretty to wear
          tonight.
           
          Dorian picks up the mask and admires it.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          We're going to make a big splash
          at that opening. One this town
          will never forget.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
           
          Agitated, Stanley paces around the room. Stanley's eyes pop open. 
          An IDEA! He stands up, clunking his heaad on the upper bunk. 
          STANLEY 
          peers down the hall and sees
           
          THE KEY GUARD
           
          watching a TV boxing match. He's CHEWING on the leather key-chain 
          strap. There's a half eaten sausage and a wedge of cheese on the 
          desk.
           
          STANLEY
           
          climbs up on the cot and looks out the window.
           
          STANLEY
          (stage whisper)
          Milo!
           
          EXT. THE ALLEY - SAME TIME
           
          Just a pile of trash. The dog's gone. Then... a RUSTLE. A filthy 
          blanket moves... and MILO emerges from it - tail waggling as he 
          sees Stanley.
           
          The little dog jumps up, helplessly trying to reach the window.
           
          STANLEY
          Come on, boy!
           
          Milo gets an idea. He jumps on boxes and trash bags, using them 
          as steps. He climbs higher and higher until he's reached the top 
          of the 
          dumpster.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Come on, Milo!
           
          Milo jumps from the dumpster. He almost reaches the window, but 
          falls back down again into the trash heap.
           
          The dog leaps a second time. On this jump, Stanley grabs him and 
          brings him through the bars.
           
          INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS
           
          Stanley gathers Milo up in his arms. The dog licks his face and 
          YELPS joyously. Stanley muzzles him and peeks -
           
          DOWN THE HALL
           
          The Key-Guard's SNORING in his chair. The chewed leather key-
          chain strap is still in his MOUTH. His half-eaten sausage and 
          cheese still lies 
          before him.
           
          STANLEY
           
          shows Milo the guard, then whispers in the dog's ear.
           
          STANLEY
          Keys, Milo. Get the keys!
           
          Milo cocks his head at the sound of the word KEYS. He zips out 
          through the bars.
           
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
           
          Milo trots down the hall and approaches the key-guard's station. 
          The dog stares and sniffs at the SNORING man.
           
          INT. STANLEY'S CELL - A MOMENT LATER
           
          Milo returns, slipping back into the cell.
           
          STANLEY
          Good boy...
           
          He pulls the wedge of cheese out of the dog's mouth.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          I said "keys" not "cheese"! Keys.
          K-E-Y-S... keys!
           
          Stanley pushes the dog back out the cell.
           
          FOLLOWING MILO
           
          He approaches the guard and stops - staring at the keys dangling 
          from the man's mouth. Milo jumps up on the desk and bites down on 
          THE 
          key-chain. He starts to pull when...
           
          The guard stirs and almost wakes up. Milo freezes. A moment 
          later, the guard starts SNORING again. Milo grabs the keys and 
          trots back to 
          Stanley's cell.
           
          STANLEY
          Atta boy, Milo. Now let's see
          if we can get out of here.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. VALHALLA CASINO - SUNSET
           
          Built on pilings at the edge of the marina, the extravagant 
          Vegas-like structure looks like a stylized Viking castle. 
          (Production note: Key mater 
          shots will be matte paintings.)
           
          REPORTERS and tuxedoed GUESTS crowd around as the Swede and town 
          DIGNITARIES prepare to cut a huge red ribbon and officially open 
          the casino.
           
          Two statuesque BLONDES in scanty Valkyrie (Viking goddess) 
          costumes present the Swede with a gigantic pair of SCISSORS. The 
          CROWD 
          applaudes and flashbulbs POP.
           
          THE SWEDE
          So, ladies and gentlemen with a
          special thanks to Mayor Tilton
          and everyone else who made this
          possible, I give you... the
          Valhalla Casino.
           
          With a mighty SNAP of the scissors the Swede cuts the ribbon and 
          the doors of the casino open wide.
           
          CUT TO:
           
          EXT. STREETS - SUNSET
           
          Dorian's limo barrels through the streets of Edge City followed 
          by two sedans full of his men.
           
          C.U. - THE SUN
           
          as it disappears behind the clouds. CAMERA PULLS BACK as the 
          limo's moon roof slides shut. We tilt down to discover Dorian and 
          Tina, 
          dressed to the nines for the opening. Dorian holds the mask in 
          his lap.
           
          DORIAN
          It's almost time.
           
          Tina nervously starts to light a cigarette. Dorian snatches the 
          lighter away from her.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          I wouldn't do that, Sweetie. We
          don't want to start the
          celebration early.
           
          Dorian flips back a blanket covering four compact wooden crates 
          marked "C-7 - Caution U.S.M.C. Demolition Materials."
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Now sit back and try to relax.
          I've got to change for the party.
           
          Dorian slowly raises the mask to his face as Tina watches in 
          horror.
           
          EXT. LIMO
           
          The tinted glass LIGHTS UP from inside like muted fireworks as 
          Dorian's transformation begins.

          INT. POLICE STATION - C.U. - SLEEPING GUARD
           
          CAMERA PANS from his snoring mouth down to his gun as a hand 
          carefully lifts it out of his holster.
           
          WIDER
           
          Gun in hand, Stanley silently backs away with Milo at his side.
           
          The Guard chokes off a snore and begins to wake up. He sees 
          Stanley's cell door standing open and goes for his gun... but 
          grasps air.
           
          STANLEY
           
          puts one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down as 
          hard as he can on the Guard's head. THONK. The Guard drops back 
          DOWN 
          on his chair unconscious.
           
          Stanley peeks from beneath his hand and regards his work. Not 
          bad. Milo yips happily.
           
          STANLEY
          Come on.
           
          Stanley turns and starts for the door when he bumps straight into 
          Lt. Kellaway.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Ipkiss!
           
          Stanley is shocked, but quickly realizes he's got the gun. He 
          points it at Kellaway with greater authority.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it! I warn you! I'm
          seriously stressed out here!
           
          KELLAWAY
          Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot.
          You're in the middle of a police
          station. There's no way you're
          just going to walk out of here.
           
          STANLEY
          (PAUSES)
          You're right.
           
          Stanley pockets Kellaway's gun while keeping him covered with the 
          Guard's gun. He pulls the handcuffs from Kellaway's belt and 
          begins to 
          handcuff the two of them together.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Now what are you doing?
           
          STANLEY
          Putting myself in your custody.
           
          KELLAWAY
          You are certifiable.
           
          Stanley unbuttons his shirt and holds it open.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo!
           
          Milo immediately jumps inside and Stanley buttons up. He now 
          looks like he has a pretty nasty pot belly, but otherwise okay.
           
          STANLEY (CONT.)
          Okay. Now we have to hurry or
          we'll miss the party.
           
          KELLAWAY
          Of course. We wouldn't want to
          keep Alice and the white rabbit
          waiting.
           
          Keeping the gun jammed in Kellaway's ribs, Stanley folds his 
          jacket over his gun hand. We hear it cock beneath the jacket. KA-
          LATCH.
           
          STANLEY
          Now move.

          as the CAR HOP attempts to open the passenger door, it EXPLODES 
          off and shoots ten feet from the car taking the unfortunate Car 
          Hop with it. 
          Dorian/Mask steps out of swirling mists within the limo in all 
          his wicked green glory.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Don't be shy, Tina. I know how
          you like to make an entrance.
           
          He pulls her out of the limo.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          And I must say, that's a dress
          to die for. Or should I say in?
           
          Dorian's men scramble, hauling the C-7 out of the limo and racing 
          off into the darkness with their automatic weapons.

          Lt. Kellaway and Stanley march past POLICEMEN, FELONS and 
          CITIZENS in the front desk area looking stiff and unnatural as 
          hell. Doyle 
          waves hello from the coffee service as he munches on a chocolate 
          doughnut.
           
          DOYLE
          Hi Lieutenant. Where are you
          taking Ipkiss?

          Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay...
          ouch!
           
          Stanley jams him in the ribs with that hidden gun.
           
          DOYLE
          What did you say?
           
          Milo pokes his head up out of Stanley's shirt, but Stanley 
          instantly pushes it back down. Doyle does a double-take wondering 
          what's wrong 
          with this picture as they continue their stiff-legged walk out 
          the door. Doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half-eaten 
          doughnut.

          CAMERA ENDFRAMES on Charlie Schumacher as he snatches a drink off 
          a passing WAITRESS' tray and turns to a gorgeous Valkyrie change 
          girl whose helmet has two large horns sticking out of it.
           
          CHARLIE
          Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful.
          One look at you and I know how

          Suddenly Mrs. Peenman appears, pushing her way past Charlie with 
          a paper bag filled with quarters.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Out of my way, Buster. Mama feels
          lucky tonight.

          Dorian/Mask steps through the smoking ruin dragging Tina after 
          him. He's flanked by a half dozen of his heavily armed men.

          off the exits. They frisk down their captives for loot and 
          jewelry. Orlando runs 
          up to Dorian/Mask with canvas sacks filled with money.

          A SECURITY GUARD now pops out from behind a mock-stone pillar and 
          opens fire on Dorian. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
           
          Orlando dives for cover. The bullets seem to have no effect as 
          Dorian rips a Viking spear off a wall display and hurls it 
          straight across the room 
          with supernatural force.
           
          The spear SKEWERS the Security Guard, sends him flying back and 
          PINS him to a slot machine which immediately rings TILT and

          quarters.

          You can come out now, Orlando.
          I think he got the point.
           
          Dorian hauls Tina over to the Vikin ship where his men are wiring 
          up boxes of C-7 and sticks of dynamite. He slams her up against 
          the prow as 
          his men lash her in place with coils of rope.

          Stanley spots a THUG standing guard outside the kitchen's double 
          doors. He ducks back down behind a barrel and gets an idea. The

          The Swede struggles desperately as he's tied to a spoke of a huge 
          wooden NUMBERS WHEEL, a kind of upright roulette wheel that's one 
          OF 
          the casino's attractions. Mayor Tilton and two other town 
          dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes.

          Dorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and 
          casually begins to juggle them.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to
          grind with you. In fact I got
          a couple and I'm afraid they may
          give you a splitting headache!
           
          He nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin. As the 
          captives SCREAM Dorian prepares to throw his first ax.

          Stanley ducks just as a Viking ax splits the dragonhead right 
          next to him in half.
           
          Dorian ROARS with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat.
           
          Stanley pops back up firing his gun. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
           
          Dorian takes the direct hits. He grins horridly at Stanley and he 
          extends his slimy tongue.
           
          C.U. - TONGUE
           
          The bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle.
           
          Dorian now sucks in a mighty breath. Stanley grabs a Viking 
          shield and protects Tina and himself.
           
          Dorian blows the bullets back at Stanley.
           
          RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT.
           
          They batter the shield. Stanley's knocked backwards from the 
          impact.
           
          A HUGE GREEN CLAW
           
          drags Stanley out and SLAMS up against the prow next to Tina. One 
          of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          How touching! The two love birds.
          Just to show you there's no hard
          feelings, I'm going to let you
          spend the rest of your lives
          together.
           
          TINA
          You've got it all wrong! I could
          care less about this creep.
          Nobody could replace you, Dorian.
          Nobody!

          If you think a line like that's 
          going to save your life, you're
          dumber than he is.
           
          TINA
          (SOFTLY)
          Okay. Maybe it's too late. Then
          all I want is... a kiss.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          A kiss?
           
          TINA
          One last kiss.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          (a beat)
          Sure, why not...
           
          Dorian/Mask sticks out his slimy TWO-FOOT TONGUE, and stick his 
          eyebrows back. Hiss massive lips flutter as he puckers up. But 
          Tina turns 
          her head way.
           
          TINA
          No! From the real Dorian. The
          guy I used to love.
          (BREATHY)
          Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian
          Tyrel.
           
          ORLANDO
          No time, boss. This building's
          going down any minute...
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          I make the decisions! And I've
          decided...
           
          Tina stares at him dreamily. Ego gets the better of him. He 
          reaches up and RIPS the mask off. SSSSHUPP!
           
          DORIAN/MASK TRANSFORMS BACK INTO DORIAN
           
          DORIAN
          ...to give the girl one last
          thrill.
           
          He plants his mouth on Tina's -- kissing her roughly. Tina really 
          gets into it. But Stanley watches as Tina slyly positions the leg 
          that he 
          freed up. And...
           
          TINA DROP-KICKS THE MASK
           
          right out of Dorian's hand. It flies into the air.
           
          A SERIES OF SLO-MO SHOTS AS...
           
          THE MASK SOARS THROUGH THE AIR...
           
          DORIAN, ORLANDO and SWEET EDDY ON THE RUN...
           
          THE MASK REACHES ITS SUMMIT THEN TUMBLES DOWN THROUGH THE AIR...
           
          HANDS REACH HIGH... FINGERTIPS GRAZE IT...
           
          But then suddenly... shockingly...
           
          A SNOUT, FLAPPING TONGUE AND BARE TEETH
           
          soar straight up through thr human hands and...
           
          MILO GRABS THE MASK
           
          as though it were a Frisbee. Everyone's stunned.
           
          REAL TIME
           
          The dog lands back on the ground -- the mask firmly in his mouth. 
          He starts to run away but... Dorian grabs his hind leg.
           
          DORIAN
          C'mere, you ugly little mutt...
           
          MILO
           
          legs pumping frantically, is losing ground. At the last second, 
          he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it. Lightning FLASHES.
           
          DORIAN'S
           
          eyes widen as
           
          MILO TRANSFORMS INTO -- DOG/MASK!
           
          His pint-sized doggy body now has a giant-sized GREEN HEAD with a 
          double-row of JAGGED CANINE TEETH. The plain collar now sparkles 
          with GLEAMING STUDS. RAZOR-TOENAILS distend. The eyes glow hell 
          fire green.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Whoa!
           
          Reflexively, Dorian lets go. Dog/Mask unleashes an incredibly 
          loud SONIC WOOF that explodes glass front slot machines all 
          around them.
           
          DORIAN (CONT.)
          Don't let it get away!
           
          Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask. But the canine-creature runs 
          between his legs and CHOMPS DOWN on his butt. The tiny dog picks 
          BIG 
          Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll.
           
          STANLEY
           
          watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less 
          than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope 
          into a 
          FLAMING VIKING WALL TORCH.
           
          Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn.
           
          DOG/MASK
           
          uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down.
           
          SWEET EDDY
          Get him off me!
           
          Dorian raises his Uzi and SPRAYS THE AREA WITH GUNFIRE! Dog/Mask 
          leaps away in the nick of time.
           
          ORLANDO
          C'mon! We've got the money.
          Let's get the hell out of here!
           
          DORIAN
          I gotta have that mask!
           
          Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines.
           
          STANLEY
           
          burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the 
          detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12
           
          IN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES
           
          Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of 
          WATER now trickles down on him from above.
           
          Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie 
          laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but...
           
          DOG/MASK
           
          pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight.
           
          VIKING SHIP
           
          Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks 
          down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer 
          stops. Tina exhales, 
          relieved, as Stanley unties her.
           
          TINA
          (kissing him)
          You did it...
           
          C.U. - TIMER
           
          as it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0!
           
          A muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards.
           
          EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT
           
          The two front support pilings BLOW UP.
           
          INT. CASINO - SAME TIME
           
          The entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to 
          slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat.
           
          STANLEY
          Milo! Milo, come!
           
          Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the 
          boat as...
           
          THE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP!
           
          The entire casino floor drops straight down.
           
          THE SHIP SLIDES
           
          straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors.
           
          DORIAN
           
          SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him.
           
          EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT
           
          The Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in 
          the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water.
           
          EXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT
           
          It bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog 
          emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables.
           
          They can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect 
          romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces.
           
          TINA
          Stanley... we made it. We're
          alive!
           
          Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof!" and leaps into Stanley's arms. 
          Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back 
          into a 
          regular dog.
           
          DORIAN
          I'll take that.
           
          They turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got a 
          gun pointed right at them.
           
          Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye 
          holes and holds it overboard.
           
          STANLEY
          Hold it right there or you'll be
          looking for this on the bottom
          of the harbor.
           
          Dorian stops in his tracks.
           
          DORIAN
          Drop it and I'll kill you all.
           
          STANLEY
          You can have it. But she gets
          to go.
           
          DORIAN
          Fine.
           
          TINA
          Go where?
           
          STANLEY
          Swimming. We're still close to
          shore.
           
          DORIAN
          Five seconds, Ipkiss.
           
          Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina.
           
          STANLEY
          Go ahead. Hurry...
           
          Tina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in.
           
          DORIAN
          Okay. Put it down. Right over
          there.
           
          Dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table. Stanley starts 
          to put down the mask. But at the last instant -- he tosses it
           
          INTO THE PILE OF TNT
           
          As Dorian turns to see where it lands, Stanley jumps him. Dorian 
          FIRES but misses. Stanley jumps Dorian -- knocking his gun away.
           
          Dorian falls into one of the WALL TORCHES -- toppling it.
           
          The TWO MEN slug it out as a FIRE STARTS. It burns closer and 
          closer to the dynamite -- the mask in the middle of the pile.
           
          IN THE WATER
           
          Tina and Milo cling to the floating barrel.
           
          TINA
          (sees fire)
          Stanley! The dynamite!
           
          BACK ON BOARD
           
          Dorian pummels Stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the 
          FIRE SEARS toward the explosives.
           
          But Stanley counters with a solid right that rocks Dorian back. 
          Dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees...
           
          The FIRE licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies.
           
          Dorian lunges for the mask. Stanley jumps overboard. The dynamite 
          explodes!
           
          FROM THE WATER
           
          Tina and Milo watch as the ship blows up. The fireball burns 
          bright, smoke everywhere.
           
          TINA
          ...Stanley?
           
          Beat. Stanley surfaces gasping for breath. Tina pulls him over to 
          the barrel and Milo licks his face.
           
          And then the smoke parts revealing...
           
          DORIAN/MASK
           
          standing on the remains of the boat. Like Wile E. Coyote, he's 
          charred pitch black, with singed hair and clothes. But like a 
          cartoon -- he just 
          shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome 
          Dorian/Mask glory.
           
          DORIAN/MASK
          What a BLAST! This mask makes
          me a god!
           
          He picks up the last fizzing, but UNDETONATED STICK OF TNT and 
          laughs.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          I'm immortal...
           
          He raises his arms and thunders to the heavens. At that moment -- 
          the SUN peaks over the horizon.
           
          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
          Do you hear? I'm immortal!
           
          The sun's rays hit the Mask. In an instant, he transforms back to 
          regular Dorian. The mask pops off Dorian's face -- useless.
           
          Dorian stares dumbfounded at the TNT stick in his hand as it --
           
          KA-BOOM! Dorian is blown to smithereens.
           
          EXT. MARINA - DAWN
           
          There are cops everywhere. Lt. Kellaway wraps Tina in a dry 
          blanket. Stanley holds out his arms.
           
          STANLEY
          Back to jail, Lieutenant?
           
          LT. KELLAWAY
          Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up
          for the rest of my life. But the
          mayor and a hundred other witnesses say
          Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and
          you're the good guy. So no jail.
          Just a downtown parade at noon.
          (RESIGNED)
          And I've got to be your escort.
           
          Stanley smiles and puts his arms around Tina. They head down the 
          beach. The two young lovers and Milo walk past --
           
          CHARLIE SCHUMACHER
           
          standing near the crowd of post-party VICTIMS being helped by the 
          POLICE and MEDICAL PERSONNEL. He's still hitting on that 
          STATUESQUE 
          Valkyrie change girl.
           
          CHARLIE
          So I deck this thug, grab his gun
          and tell Stanley, "Take cover,
          Buddy. I'll get these folks out
          sae and sound." Y'know
          we should go back to my place so
          I can tell you the rest of the
          story.
           
          ANGLE ON SHORELINE
           
          Mrs. Peenman is walking along grumbling to herself when she 
          notices the mask floating to shore with some of the wreckage from 
          the boat.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN
          Just look at this mess...
           
          She picks it up out of the surf and The Mask FX theme begins to 
          pound in her head.
           
          Back to Charlie and his Valkyrie.
           
          CHARLIE
          So what do you say, sweetheart?
          Let's you and me go back to my
          place and scramble some eggs.
           
          Suddenly Mrs. Peenman/Mask ZZZIPS up and sweeps Charlie off his 
          feet. She's the most whacked-out Mask creature yet with a huge 
          GREEN 
          Witch Hazel face and Bride of Frankenstein hair.
           
          MRS. PEENMAN/MASK
          Hello short, dark and handsome!
          C'mere and give Momma a kissy-poo!
           
          She starts SMACKING her king-sized lips horribly.
           
          CHARLIE
          (TERRIFIED)
          Yah! Put me down!
           
          She jams a hand down the front of Charlie's pants.
           
          MRS.PEENMAN/MASK
          Let's see what caliber pistol
          you're packing there, soldier boy!
           
          She gets a grip and squeezes. AHOOGA! AHOOGA! Charlie SCREAMS, 
          ttears himself from her grasp and starts running for his life. 
          CAMERA 
          PANS with Mrs. Peenman as she RICOCHETS after him hooting 
          laughter. We ENDFRAME on Stanley and Tina as they watch the 
          BIZARRE 
          spectacle pass them by. They turn and embrace for a well deserved 
          kiss as Milo yips happily and squirms up between them.
           

          THE END

	--------------------------------------------------------------

	EXT. ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. - 4:00 AM

	A patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water.  BACK
	FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to
	massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River
	manor house; the country estate of William Parrish.

	INT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM

	MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into
	an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with
	Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists
	and trees and small boats and distant humans.

	INT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM

	MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-
	ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping
	occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a
	man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.

	Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him.
	Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity
	of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes
	up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the
	wind itself:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		... Yes.

	Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is
	not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades,
	the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.

	He rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze
	outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes
	up:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		Yes...

	It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has
	heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He
	can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild-
	ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed,
	trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't
	heard; he is not sure.

	He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his
	eyes.

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		Yes.

	Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one
	there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up,
	should he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute
	stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a
	light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but
	then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and
	finally, exhausted, falls back asleep.

	EXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING

	The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-
	rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and
	adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms,
	speakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's
	older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she
	relishing every moment.

	A Painter approaches.

			     PAINTER
		The big tent, Miss Allison --

			     ALLISON
		Paint is rust and moss green.
		Medieval colors -- Daddy's like
		an old knight.

	A Florist stops her.

			     FLORIST
		The head table --?

			     ALLISON
		What about it?

			     FLORIST
		The flowers, ma'am--?

			     ALLISON
		Freesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy
		loves freesia -- and you, over there,
		lights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking
		for a saffron glow -- sort of tea-
		dance twenties.

	EXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING

	Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ-
	ing the activity outside through the windows.  He checks his
	watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family
	retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish
	passes.

			     PARRISH
		What do you think of all this, May?

			     MAY
		It's going to be beautiful.  And
		Miss Allison says the President may
		come.

			     PARRISH
		Oh, the President's got better
		things to do than come to my
		birthday party.

			     MAY
			(smiling)
		What?

	Parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who,
	on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.

			     ALLISON
		Daddy!

			     PARRISH
		Hi, Allison --

			     ALLISON
		Have you got a minute?

			     PARRISH
		Not much more.  Big day in the big
		city.  What's on your mind?

			     ALLISON
		Fireworks.  Update -- we're con-
		structing the number '65' on the
		barge, archers from the State
		College at New Paltz will shoot
		flaming arrows at it, when it
		catches fire it will give us the
		effect of a Viking funeral with none
		of the morbidity... The Hudson River
		Authority says, for you, they'll
		make a special dispensation - of
		course there'll be an overtime bill
		for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...

			     PARRISH
		Allison, I trust you.  This is your
		thing.

			     ALLISON
		But it's your birthday.

	Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break-
	fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is
	grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.

			     SUSAN
		Good morning, Dad.

			     PARRISH
		Hi, honey.

			     ALLISON
			(to Susan)
		I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.

			     SUSAN
			(smiling)
		Drew called from the AStar, they're
		still two minutes away.

			     PARRISH
		Drew's aboard?

			     SUSAN
		He wanted to ride back down with
		you. Now sit and relax, get some-
		thing in that flat tummy of yours --

	But Parrish only pours coffee.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
			(to Allison)
		You coming?

			     ALLISON
		You've got patients waiting, I've
		got three hysterical chefs, one
		loves truffles, the other hates
		truffles, the third one doesn't know
		what truffles are.  I'd better drive
		down.

	Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing
	in intensity.

			     PARRISH
			(unconsciously)
		I hate parties --

			     ALLISON
		Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're
		going to love it.

			     PARRISH
		Isn't it enough to be on this earth
		sixty-five years without having to
		be reminded of it.

			     ALLISON
		No.

	Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting.

			     SUSAN
		Will you relax?  I know it is a big
		deal day --

			     PARRISH
		How did you know?

			     SUSAN
		Drew told me.

			     PARRISH
		Does Drew tell you everything?

			     SUSAN
		I hope so.

			     PARRISH
		You like him, don't you?

			     SUSAN
		Yeah.  I guess so.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		I don't like to interfere.

			     SUSAN
		...Then don't.

	The helicopter CHOPS in overhead.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		-- Here comes our boy now --
		Shall we?

	EXT. COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING

	A BUTLER and May carry the overnight bags for the family as
	led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter.  En route
	they pass QUINCE, 38, Allison's husband, who is perched at a
	portable bar with AMBROSE, the head caterer, tasting wines.

			     QUINCE
		...This shit's not bad.

			     AMBROSE
		-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr.
		Quince, a possibility for dessert.

			     QUINCE
			(pointing to another
			 bottle)
		And that?

			     AMBROSE
		Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it
		for the appetizer.

	Ambrose takes a sip, swishes the wine in his mouth, spits it
	in a bucket.

			     QUINCE
		What do you do that for?

			     AMBROSE
		Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.

			     QUINCE
		9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come
		from, the sun's over the yardarm,
		m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.

	Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is
	hailed by Allison.

			     ALLISON
		Quince!  Everybody's waiting!

	Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as
	DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it,
	approaches Parrish and Susan.

			     DREW
			(to Susan)
		Hello, Beautiful.

			     SUSAN
		Hi.

	Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for
		coming out.

			     DREW
		Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to
		line up a few ducks before kickoff.
		Any thoughts?  Last minute refine-
		ments or variations?

			     PARRISH
		'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did
		hear a voice last night.

			     DREW
		A voice?

			     PARRISH
		In my sleep.

			     DREW
		What'd it say?

			     PARRISH
		'Yes'.

			     DREW
		'Yes' to the deal?

			     PARRISH
		Maybe, who knows?  You know how
		voices are.  Let's go.

	Quince comes running up now.

			     QUINCE
		Hi, Bill --

			     PARRISH
		Good morning, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		How're you doing--?

			     PARRISH
		I'm doing great.  You ready?

			     QUINCE
		I am, this is it.  B Day.

			     PARRISH
		How's that, Quince?

			     QUINCE
		Bontecou Day.  Going to close
		with Big John -- Look at you, Bill,
		all cool as a cat and over at
		Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting
		in his pants.

			     ALLISON
			(to Quince)
		Honey, please.

			     QUINCE
		Okay.  All aboard - New York, New
		York!

			     ALLISON
		Remember everybody, tonight, dinner
		in the city at Daddy's.  You too,
		Drew.  We've still got some loose
		ends --

			     PARRISH
		Not my birthday again?

			     SUSAN
		You're only six-five once.

			     PARRISH
		Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's
		get this day started.

	Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and
	Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him
	As Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors.

	INT. ASTAR HELICOPTER - DAY

	The configuration of seats has Drew beside Parrish, in front
	of them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats.
	Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache
	case and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the
	pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up
	and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances
	over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.
	He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks
	that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into
	her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the
	work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.

			     SUSAN
		I thought you were in a meeting--?

			     PARRISH
		I am.  With you.

	He peers up ahead at Drew, on the telephone and gesticulat-
	ing intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the CHOP
	of the blades and the pilot pressed up against him.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Do you love Drew?

			     SUSAN
		...There's a start for a meeting.

			     PARRISH
		I know it's none of my business --

	Susan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her
	father on the cheek.

			     SUSAN
		No, it's none of your business.

	Another moment.

			     PARRISH
		Do you love Drew?

			     SUSAN
		You mean like you loved Mom?

			     PARRISH
		Forget about me and Mom -- are you
		going to marry him?

			     SUSAN
		Probably.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
			(smiles)
		Don't get carried away.

			     SUSAN
		Uh oh --

			     PARRISH
		Susan, you're a hell of a woman.
		You've got a great career, you're
		beautiful --

			     SUSAN
		And I'm your daughter and no man
		will ever be good enough for me.

			     PARRISH
		Well, I wasn't going to say that --

			     SUSAN
		What were you going to say?

			     PARRISH
		Listen, I'm crazy about the guy --
		He's smart, he's aggressive, he
		could carry Parrish Communications
		into the 21st century and me along
		with it.

			     SUSAN
		So what's wrong with that?

			     PARRISH
		That's for me.  I'm talking about
		you.  It's not so much what you say
		about Drew, it's what you don't say.

			     SUSAN
		You're not listening --

			     PARRISH
		Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of
		excitement, not a whisper of a
		thrill, this relationship has all
		the passion of a pair of titmice.

			     SUSAN
		Don't get dirty, Dad --

			     PARRISH
		Well, it worries me.  I want you
		to get swept away.  I want you to
		levitate.  I want you to sing with
		rapture and dance like a dervish.

			     SUSAN
		That's all?

			     PARRISH
		Be deliriously happy.  Or at least
		leave yourself open to be.

			     SUSAN
		'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going
		to do my upmost --

	He smiles.

			     PARRISH
		I know it's a cornball thing but
		love is passion, obsession, someone
		you can't live without.  If you
		don't start with that, what are you
		going to end up with?  I say fall
		head over heels.  Find someone you
		can love like crazy and who'll love
		you the same way back.  And how do
		you find him?  Forget your head and
		listen to your heart.  I'm not
		hearing any heart.
			(a moment)
		Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll
		come back.  Because, the truth is
		there is no sense living your life
		without this.  To make the journey
		and not fall deeply in love -- well,
		you haven't lived a life at all.
		You have to try.  Because if you
		haven't tried, you haven't lived.

			     SUSAN
		Bravo.

			     PARRISH
		Aw, you're tough.

			     SUSAN
		I'm sorry.  But give it to me again.
		The short version.

			     PARRISH
		Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning
		could strike.

	Silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Forgive the lecture --

			     SUSAN
		I won't.  And when I tell Drew about
		it, he won't either.

			     PARRISH
		You won't tell him, and even if you
		did, he'd clock it and punch it into
		his laptop in order to pull out some
		key phrases when he gives the
		Commencement Speech at Wharton.

			     SUSAN
		You're terrible.

			     PARRISH
		I know.  But I'm the only father
		you've got.

	She kisses him on the cheek.

			     SUSAN
		Thank God.

			     PARRISH
		He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.

	EXT. 34TH STREET HELIPAD, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	The AStar lands, an attendant, waiting with a luggage cart,
	rushes to open the door and unload the bags.  The passengers,
	Parrish paired with Quince, Drew with Susan, file off the
	rooftop through a door which opens into an elevator.

	INT. ELEVATOR, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	Parrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride
	downwards.

			     QUINCE
		Hey, this is it, the hour approach-
		es, I'm getting all excited.  So
		what do you think, is it --
			(indicates Drew and
			 Parrish)
		-- just the 'Executive Committee' or
		could you guys use me?

			     DREW
		Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer,
		but it's all set for just me and Bill.
		More people might --

			     QUINCE
		I know.  Gum up the works.

	Parrish is about to make some reassuring comment to Quince
	when the Voice suddenly intrudes:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		'...I know, it's none of my
		business.'

			     PARRISH
		What?

			     DREW
		I was saying to Quince we won't
		need --

			     PARRISH
		Did you just hear something?

			     DREW
		Why yes, Bill, I was saying to
		Quince --

			     PARRISH
		No no, not you.

			     SUSAN
		Daddy, what's the matter?

			     PARRISH
		Nothing.  I'm sorry.

	A respectful silence, the elevator continues downwards,
	suddenly the Voice intrudes again:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		'...I want you to levitate.  I want
		you to sing with rapture and dance
		like a dervish.'

	Parrish grunts bizarrely, Susan notices and reacts:

			     SUSAN
		What is it, Daddy --?

			     PARRISH
		Nothing.

	Parrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a
	thing but him.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Just talking to myself again.  You
		know me --

	The elevator door opens.

			     PARRISH
		Well, here we are --

	Parrish leads the group out.

	EXT. 34TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	They exit the building.

			     SUSAN
			(to Parrish)
		Are you okay?

			     PARRISH
		A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears
		pricked.  I'm ready for action.

			     SUSAN
		Well, go get 'em, Pops.

			     PARRISH
		Yer damn right.

	Parrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine,
	Quince looks longingly after them.  Susan, blowing a kiss
	goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a
	cab.

	INT. LOBBY, BONTECOU WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

			     DREW
		...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo
		opportunity, you and Big John, it'll
		lead network news.  Okay so far?

			     PARRISH
		Sounds good.

			     DREW
		It's going to be great --

			     PARRISH
		Do you think I need a haircut?

			     DREW
		Bill, after this deal, you'll be
		able to afford one.

	Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator.

	INT. BONTECOU EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY

	Parrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing
	the overkill decor.

			     DREW
		Their PR guy asked me, what did I
		think Parrish Communications stood
		for, that's principle and ethics-
		wise?  I came up with something, but
		then it occurred to me, why don't I
		ask Bill?  What do you think?

	A moment, Parrish shrugs.

			     PARRISH
		Our first annual report, must be
		thirty-five years ago now, I owned
		two stations, I wrote down a state-
		ment of purpose, that one day you
		would wake up to a Parrish radio
		station, read a Parrish paper at
		breakfast, catch our news on tele-
		vision during the day, and go to bed
		with one of our books or magazines
		and you would always be told the
		truth and in the bargain, have a
		good time.

			     DREW
		That's great!  Wait 'til I show it
		to Bontecou.

	Drew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec-
	utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white-
	haired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55.

			     BONTECOU
		Bill, thanks for coming over...
			(to Drew)
		And how're you doing today, Drew?
			(to Parrish)
		You've got a firecracker here, the
		kid's really set the table.

			     PARRISH
		Good, good.  Glad to hear it.

			BONTECOU
		We've met before, y'know, that White
		House function, the President had
		you on his right and you know where
		I was?

			     PARRISH
		I'm sorry, I don't recall --

			     BONTECOU
		Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I
		want to come in from the outfield,
		bat cleanup like you have, learn the
		plush ropes --

			     PARRISH
		I thought you were buying my company.

			     BONTECOU
		Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy
		Parrish Communications.  I could pay
		for it, of course, but it would
		always have your imprint.

	Silence.  Parrish looks around at the circle of 'suits',
	Bontecou holding away.

			     PARRISH
		Well, that's very nice to hear.

	Drew nods excitedly.

	EXT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL CORNELL MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

	The busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue.

	INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK AVENUE - DAY

	A thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's
	entrance, customers cheek-by-jowl as a pair of waiters
	juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors,
	residents and interns.

	Susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner.  A counterman,
	with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front
	of her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for
	the day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her
	speaking into the pay phone.

	An attractive YOUNG MAN, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at
	his feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder.

			     YOUNG MAN
		...Honey, you've got to go on...
		there's a time to sow and a time to
		reap, you sow now and forget about
		him... yeah, I liked him, I don't
		like him anymore... because you're
		my honey and anybody messes with you
		messes with me -- I'm on a plane in
		a minute... as soon as I get my
		phone in, you're my first call,
		that's a promise... where you going
		now?... good, hit the books, get that
		degree, one day we'll hang out a
		shingle together... you bet, honey...
		later.

	The Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an
	overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the
	counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the
	breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take
	her eyes off him.  He senses her eyes, glances over, his
	cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Good morning, I was talking kind of
		loud there, sorry.

			     SUSAN
		Not at all.  It was fascinating.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating'
		about it?

			     SUSAN
		You and 'Honey'?

			     YOUNG MAN
		My kid sister.  She just broke up
		with her boyfriend and she's
		thinking about dropping out of
		law school.

			     SUSAN
		I'm sorry --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Nothing to be sorry about.  That's
		the way with men and women, isn't
		it?

			     SUSAN
		What's the way?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Nothing lasts.

			     SUSAN
		I agree --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Why?

			     SUSAN
		I was just being agreeable, now I've
		got to explain why?

			     YOUNG MAN
		I'm not trying to sharpshoot you,
		but that 'nothing lasts' stuff,
		that's what was the trouble with
		Honey's guy.  He was fooling around
		and Honey caught him at it.  One
		girlfriend wasn't enough for him.

			     SUSAN
		So you're a one-girl guy?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Damn right.  Looking for her right
		now.  Who knows?  You might be her.

	Susan laughs.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		Well, don't laugh.  I just arrived
		in town, got a new job -- I'm trying
		to get into this apartment.  You a
		doctor?

			     SUSAN
		How'd you know?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Everybody's a doctor around here.
		This apartment house is all green
		pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm
		waiting for to vacate is a doctor.
		What kind of doctor?

			     SUSAN
		Me?  Internal medicine.

	The Young Man smiles.

			     YOUNG MAN
		So if I needed a doctor, you could
		be it?

			     SUSAN
		I could be her.

			     YOUNG MAN
		'Her'.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		Yes, I could.
			(a moment)
		I have an office in the hospital.

			     YOUNG MAN
		-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive
		in this big bad city and I not only
		find a doctor, a beautiful woman as
		well.

	Susan looks into her coffee.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		I'm sorry, you mind my saying that?

			     SUSAN
		Not at all.

			     YOUNG MAN
		How 'bout another cup of coffee?

			     SUSAN
		I've got patients coming in --

			     YOUNG MAN
		And I want to get into my apartment
		and go to work.  Please, what do you
		say, another cup of coffee?

	Two pots are warming behind the counter, he reaches over and
	refills her cup and his.  Pushes a container and pitcher to-
	wards her.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		I see you use lots of sugar and
		cream.  Me, too...

	They smile at each other, fix up their coffee.

	EXT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	A magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in
	the midtown sea of glass and aluminum.

	INT. OUTER LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	Parrish and Drew enter, no particular fanfare but an aware-
	ness the 'Chief' has arrived, everyone giving Parrish the
	appropriate wide berth, Drew right beside him.

			     DREW
		I'm all excited --

			     PARRISH
		Me, too.

			     DREW
		I thought it was great, I thought
		you and Big John would be like a
		couple of bulls in a china shop --
			(faltering)
		Instead it was --

			     PARRISH
		Like a marriage made in heaven?

			     DREW
		You have a way with words.

	They stride to the main bank of elevators.

	INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICES, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	Parrish, Drew beside him, proceeds through a high tech, but
	tasteful, maze, spiffy executive secretaries at burnished
	desks.  Neither looking right or left, somehow Parrish man-
	ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods
	despite his swift entrance.

	He passes through an open set of doors and he is into his
	own suite, commanded by JENNIFER, his assistant.

			     JENIFER
		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		Hi, Jennifer.

	Drew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at
	the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this
	is as far as he goes without being invited.

			     DREW
		So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll
		recommend, we close and it's a deal,
		right?

			     PARRISH
		As close as a deal could be.

			     DREW
			(bursting)
		Olympic.

	Parrish disappears into his office.  Drew, on his way out,
	glides past Jennifer's desk.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		This is our lucky day.

	Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to
	Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but
	Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes
	it, returns to her desk.

	INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY

	Alone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately
	changes.  Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares
	out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the
	Manhattan skyline: cogitates.

	He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he
	flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp
	but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he
	ignores it.

	Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the
	pain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to
	massage the pain, it does not subside.  Parrish stands,
	trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some-
	thing is unmistakably wrong.  Now a SOUND which he has
	come to recognize, makes itself heard:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		Yes.

	Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the
	source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction,
	yet surrounds him.  Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply
	intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a
	corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other
	clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently
	seized the upper part of his body.  He breaks out in a sweat,
	his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself:

			     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
		...Yes.

	Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him
	on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer,
	each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself,
	consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a
	hallucination but which he is certain is not.  Parrish is
	possessed.  He angles his face in every direction, arbi-
	trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously,
	enrage, responds to the Voice.

			     PARRISH
		'Yes' what?

			     VOICE
		'Yes' is the answer to your
		question.

			     PARRISH
		I didn't ask any question.

			     VOICE
		I believe you did.

	Parrish is absolutely confounded, seized up with pain and
	consternation at this unseen Voice which has such presence
	and reality.

			     PARRISH
		Who are you?

	Silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Goddammit, what is going on?!

			     VOICE
		I think you know --

			     PARRISH
		I don't!

			     VOICE
		Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried,
		you haven't lived'.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		What are you talking about?

			     VOICE
		What you were talking about.

	Parrish gasps.

			     PARRISH
		What is this?  Who is this fucking
		guy?

	He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping,
	his skin ashen.  Now he addresses the Voice again, searching
	for it in another direction:

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Tell me who you are!

			     VOICE
		Are you giving me orders?

			     PARRISH
		I'm sorry, I --

			     VOICE
		No, you're not.  You're trying to
		'handle' the situation but this is
		the one situation you knew you never
		could handle.

	A spasm, the worst one yet, finally it subsides and there is
	an eerie silence in the room, a VOID, almost more disturbing
	than the voice that has filled it.

			     PARRISH
		Where are you?  Are you there?

			     VOICE
		It's enough now.

			     PARRISH
		Please.  Talk to me --

			     VOICE
		There's going to be plenty of time
		for that.

			     PARRISH
		What do you mean?!

			     VOICE
		I think you know --

			     PARRISH
		Know what?
			(a moment)
		Know what, goddammit!

	The VOICE is gone.  Parrish searches the corner, but the
	room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by
	the VOICE, it is now just Parrish's office.  Faint SQUEALS of
	traffic from the street, then a KNOCK at the door.

	Parrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is
	still wet with sweat, the KNOCK again.  Parrish straightens
	himself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his
	hair, blinks as he addresses the door.

			     PARRISH
			(carefully)
		Come in.

	Jennifer enters.

			     JENIFER
		I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish.
		Are you all right?

			     PARRISH
		Sure.

			     JENIFER
		Lunch is 'in' today, have you given
		it any thought --_

			     PARRISH
			(interrupting)
		No.  Nothing.

			     JENIFER
		Nothing?

	Parrish is within himself, doesn't answer.

			     JENIFER (cont'd)
		Why don't I think of something?

	Parrish still doesn't answer, however Jennifer is satisfied,
	correctly hearing his silence as an affirmative.  She has her
	hand on the door, 'Open' or 'Closed'?  He nods and she closes it.
	Utter silence again.  Parrish's eyes search the room, nothing
	there.

	INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, YORK AVENUE, DAY

	The place has cleared out now, the counterman busy bussing
	tables laden with dishes and cups, Susan and the Young Man
	are still at the counter, but about to leave.

			     YOUNG MAN
		...It's kind of a pro bono job.

			     SUSAN
		'Pro bono'.  That means doing good
		-- Going to be doing good all your
		life?

			     YOUNG MAN
		I know what you're saying.  Doesn't
		pay very well.  Depends on the woman
		I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger
		house, a better car, lotsa kids,
		college doesn't come cheap --

			     SUSAN
		You'd give up what you want for the
		woman you marry?

			     YOUNG MAN
		I would.

	Susan rises now, the Young Man with her, leaving money for
	their checks they head for the door.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		If I married you, I'd want to give
		you what you wanted, I know it's
		old fashioned and all that, but
		what's wrong with taking care of a
		woman?  She takes care of you.

			     SUSAN
		You'll have a hard time finding a
		woman like that these days --

			     YOUNG MAN
		You never know.  Lightning could
		strike.

	Susan at the door now, pauses abruptly, her eyes on the
	Young Man.

	EXT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, YORK AVENUE - DAY

	The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out
	onto the street.

	Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and
	vulnerable.

			     SUSAN
		I've got to go --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Did I say something wrong?

			     SUSAN
		No, it was so right it scares me.

			     YOUNG MAN
		I've been thinking... I don't want
		you to be my doctor.  Because I
		don't want you to examine me.

			     SUSAN
		Why?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Because I like you so much.
			(a moment)
		You have coffee here every morning,
		don't you?  If I came by, could you
		give me the name of a doctor?

	Another moment.

			     SUSAN
		Sure, I'll give you the name of a
		doctor.
			(a moment)
		...And I don't want to examine you.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Why not?

			     SUSAN
		Because I like you so much.  Now
		I've got to go.

	She hurries away down the sidewalk, the Young Man watching
	her.  Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - SUSAN

	She looks back at the Young Man, then turns and walks on.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE YOUNG MAN

	He looks back at Susan as the distance between them widens,
	now he turns and walks on.

	ON SUSAN

	She looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed
	in the opposite direction, his back to her.  She turns the
	corner and continues on.

	ON THE YOUNG MAN

	Approaching the corner, he looks back for Susan yet again,
	but she is gone, still turned he steps off into the street
	and a hospital supplies truck, speeding down the curb lane,
	HITS HIM BROADSIDE, a horrific impact, the THUD echoes as
	his body arcs through the air.

	Another sickening THUD as it lands, the Young Man lies
	crumpled, still.

						CUT TO:

	INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	A beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a
	glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky-
	line.  The hour is before dinner: gathered on one side of
	the room are Allison and Parrish, on the other side Drew and
	Quince.  COYLE, a butler, and LUISA, the housekeeper, pass
	hors d'oeuvres and drinks.

			     ALLISON
		...Music, I know how you love music,
		Daddy, and I want to have music that
		pleases you -- and of course doesn't
		put a thousand other people to sleep
		-- I've agonized over this and
		finally settled on Sidney Brown,
		twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus
		I'm feathering in a Latin sextet on
		their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini
		Lopez-zy, I forget their names --

	Parrish has tuned Allison out, he tried to stay with it, but
	his mind has wandered, the event of the day too much with
	him.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		You haven't heard a word, have you?
		I keep talking and all you do is nod
		like Mr. Himmelfass in The
		Nutcracker.

	Parrish still doesn't answer.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		You don't care, do you?

			     PARRISH
		What, honey?

			     ALLISON
		I lay awake nights in a cold sweat,
		I want this party to be like some-
		thing Mom would have made for you,
		I want it to be perfect --

			     PARRISH
			(attentive now)
		I know you do, darling.

			     ALLISON
		And you could care less --

			     PARRISH
		Oh, you couldn't be more wrong,
		sweetheart.  I can' tell you how
		much I appreciate it and how I'm
		looking forward to it.

			     ALLISON
		Good.  Songs.  What songs should
		Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we
		can forget about -- what songs do
		you think he should play?

	A stab of pain, Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but
	manages to keep his attention on Allison.

			     PARRISH
		Tell it to me again.

	Suddenly, the Voice cuts in:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		...Yes.

	Parrish's head snaps, startled by the SOUND.

			     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
			(to Parrish)
		Did you miss me?

	Parrish reacts once more, aware again he is the only one who
	has heard the Voice, as an oblivious Allison continues:

			     ALLISON
			(to Parrish)
		Never mind.  Leave it to me.

	Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the
	Voice.  His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful.

			LUISA
		Mr. Parrish, dinner is served.

			     ALLISON
			(to Quince and Drew,
			 across the room)
		Chow-time, you guys.

	Parrish is confounded.  Blindly and disconcerted, he follows
	Allison and Drew and Quince.

	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	As a disturbed Parrish approaches the table, he hears the
	Voice once more:

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		What are you looking so provoked
		about?  'Did you miss me?'  It's
		a normal question.  I missed you.
		But what do I get back?  'Not an
		ounce of excitement, not a whisper
		of a thrill --'

	Parrish sits.

			     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
		'-- This relationship has all the
		passion of a pair of titmice'.

	Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his
	panic.

			     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
		I'm waiting outside.

	The conversation swirls on around Parrish, he is deaf to it:

			     ALLISON
			(to Drew)
		Did you speak to the Governor?

			     DREW
		He's coming.

			     ALLISON
		His wife?

			     DREW
		Unfortunately.  I sat between them
		at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was
		better than Seconal.

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		I'm waiting outside.  Won't someone
		come to the door?

	Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of
	himself.  As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa:

			     PARRISH
		Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa?

			     LUISA
		I didn't hear a ring, sir.

			     PARRISH
		Please have a look --

	Luisa goes as Coyle continues serving.

			     ALLISON
			(to Quince)
		What about the Mayor?

			     QUINCE
		He said he would be there with bells
		on.

			     DREW
		Good, maybe they'll drown him out.

	Parrish is still not hearing a word, preoccupied with the
	return of Luisa.

			     ALLISON
		Please don't be negative, Drew, we
		have an acceptance list that would
		do The White House proud -- The
		Secretary-General of the UN, the
		Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators,
		I don't know how many Congressmen,
		and at least twelve of the Fortune
		'500'.

			     QUINCE
		No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a
		Masters champion?  Someone I could
		talk to.
			(a moment)
		Or would talk to me.

	Luisa returns to Parrish as the others' conversation drones
	on:

			     LUISA
		You're right, Mr. Parrish.  There
		was a gentleman at the door.  He's
		waiting for you in the foyer.

	Parrish is stunned.

			     PARRISH
			(after a moment)
		Show him into the library, tell him
		I'll be right there.

	Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage
	to go as Allison continues:

			     ALLISON
		I've arranged for favors -- silver
		charm bracelets for the women,
		platinum keychains for the men --
		all engraved 'W.P.' -- but now I'm
		thinking of scrubbing them, they
		seem so ordinary.

	Finally Parrish rises from the table, starts out.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		Are they ordinary?  Do they seem
		that way to you, Daddy?

			     PARRISH
		Uh -- I don't know.  No - uh - I
		don't...

	Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into
	disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room.

			     DREW
			(to Allison)
		You're overthinking it --

			     QUINCE
		I don't think they're ordinary.  I
		love keychains.

	INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears
	the doorway to the library.  The door is open.  He hesitates
	before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his
	eye can see, now tentatively, he enters.

	INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	A beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club
	chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library
	ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat
	carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from
	the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured
	glass.

	Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in
	sight.

			     PARRISH
		Hello?

	Silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Anyone here?

	No response.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I said is anyone here?!

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		Quiet down.

	Parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his
	eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch
	of which is exactly what he has heard before.  There is the
	sense that someone is there but Parrish cannot see him, and
	he does not dare look.

			     PARRISH
			(quietly)
		Where are you?

			     VOICE (V.O.)
		I'm here.

	Now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured
	glass, the section of the room most distant from Parrish,
	there is a shape.  Something is there.

			     PARRISH
		What is this, a joke, right?  Some
		kind of elaborate practical joke?
		At my 40th reunion, we delivered a
		casket to the Class president's
		hotel room and --

			     VOICE
		Quiet.

	Parrish falls silent, something in the SOUND and TONE of the
	Voice muting him.  He takes a step backwards.

			     VOICE (cont'd)
		Where are you going?

			     PARRISH
		I - I - uh --

	The shape moves, makes itself more visible.  Although still
	diffused by the glass, the shape has definition, a person, a
	man, his features are not yet distinguishable, but he is
	there all right.

			     VOICE
		The great Bill Parrish at a loss for
		words?  The man from whose lips fall
		'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses-
		sion'...all those admonitions about
		being 'deliberately happy', what
		there is no sense 'living your life
		without...', all the sparks and
		energy you give off, the rosy advice
		you dispense in round, pear-shaped
		tones --

			     PARRISH
		What the hell is this?  Who are you?

			     VOICE
		Just think of millenniums multiplied
		by aeons compounded by infinity,
		I've been around that long, but it's
		only recently that your affairs here
		have piqued my interest.  Call it
		boredom, the natural curiosity of
		me, the most lasting and significant
		element in existence has come to see
		you.

	Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing.

			     PARRISH
		About what?

			     VOICE
		I want to have a look around before
		I take you.

			     PARRISH
		'Take me'...?  Where?

			     VOICE
		It requires competence, wisdom,
		experience -- all those things they
		say about you in testimonials --
		and you're the one.

			     PARRISH
		'The one' to do what?

			     VOICE
		Show me around.  Be my guide.  And
		in return, you get...

			     PARRISH
			(breathless)
		Get what?

			     VOICE
		Time.

			     PARRISH
		What the hell are you talking about?

			     VOICE
		Watch it!

			     PARRISH
		I'm sorry --

			     VOICE
		In return you'll receive minuets, days,
		weeks, I'm not going to go into details
		... what matters is that I stay
		interested.

	Parrish squints, trying to make sense of what is happening.

			     VOICE (cont'd)
		...'Yes'.

			     PARRISH
		Yes what?

			     VOICE
		'Yes' is the answer to your ques-
		tion.

			     PARRISH
		What question?

			     VOICE
		Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The
		question you've been asking yourself
		with increased regularity, at odd
		moments, panting through the extra
		game of handball, when you ran for
		the plane in Delhi, when you sat up
		in bed last night and hit the floor
		in the office this morning.  The
		question that is in the back of your
		throat, choking the blood to your
		brain, ringing in the ears over and
		over as you put it to yourself --

			     PARRISH
		The 'question' --

			     VOICE
			(urging)
		Yes, Bill.  The question.

	After a moment.

			     PARRISH
		...Am I going to die?

	The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no
	longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re-
	vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the
	coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off-
	center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Yes.

	A moment, Parrish beside himself.  He cannot bring himself
	to speak, finally:

			     PARRISH
		Am I dreaming this?
			(Another moment)
		Are you a dream?

			     YOUNG MAN
		I am not a dream.

			     PARRISH
		You're coming to 'take me'.  What is
		that?  Who the hell are you?

	The Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches
	from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man
	daring Parrish to identify him:

			     PARRISH
		You are --?

			     YOUNG MAN
		  	(urging again)
		'...Yes --'

	Parrish turns away.  But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in
	front of him again.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
			(gently)
		Who am I?

			     PARRISH
		...Death.

	Parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what
	he has comprehended.  He surveys the Young Man who, at this
	moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		You're Death?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Yes.

			     PARRISH
		Death!

			     YOUNG MAN
		That's me.

			     PARRISH
		You're not Death.  You're just a kid
		in a jacket and a pair of pants.

			     YOUNG MAN
		The jacket and the pair of pants
		came with the body I took.  Let me
		ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?

	A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment.

			     PARRISH
		You want me to be your guide --?

			     YOUNG MAN
		You fill the bill, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		I do?
			(a moment)
		How long will you be staying?

			     YOUNG MAN
		You should hope quite a while.

			     PARRISH
		And then --?

	The Young Man nods, gently.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		It's... it's... over.

	A long silence.  Parrish and the Young Man take each other in,
	the sense that now they understand each other.  A SOUND at the
	door.

			     LUISA (O.S.)
		Mr. Parrish?

	Parrish does not hear her for the moment, Luisa steps inside
	the Library.

			     LUISA (cont'd)
		Will the gentleman be staying for
		dinner, sir?

	Parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then
	at the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to
	verify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by
	Luisa.  The Young Man interjects:

			     YOUNG MAN
			(to Luisa)
		Yes.
			(a polite afterthought)
		Thank you.

	Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits.  Parrish is frozen,
	dumbfounded.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
			(to Parrish)
		Where is dinner?

	Parrish does not answer at first.

			     PARRISH
		This is crazy -- you're not going to
		eat dinner with us.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Bill, I am eating dinner with you.
		And your family.  And that's what
		we're doing.  It's not open for
		discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't
		you understand?

	Parrish is frightened by the response.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		Good.  Now lead the way.

	Parrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out
	of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer.

			     PARRISH
		Excuse me?  Could I say something?

			     YOUNG MAN
		Of course.

			     PARRISH
			(quietly)
		It just occurred to me --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Speak up, please.

			     PARRISH
			(louder)
		When I introduce you, if I say who
		you are, I don't think anyone will
		stay for dinner.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Then don't.

	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	As Parrish and the Young Man enter, Allison is heard in the
	background.

			     ALLISON
		...Well, here's another possibility.
		It's a little last minute, but how does
		this strike you?  Kaleidoscopes. Little
		gold kaleidoscopes.  Some German firm
		went kerplunkt, Tiffany's picked these
		things up, they're perfect party favors,
		however they're not personal, they're
		winter scene or something, snow-flakes
		and dachshunds...

	Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward
	pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family
	dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey-
	ed.  Finally, Allison breaks the ice:

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
			(to the Young Man)
		Hi there --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Hello.

	Parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at
	each person as if he were discovering a face of the first
	time.

			     PARRISH
		Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away
		for so long -- uh -- this is a
		friend of mine I asked to drop by --
		we got to talking and stuff -- uh --
		he's going to join us for dinner --
		um --

	Parrish drifts into another awkward pause.

			     ALLISON
			(to the Young Man)
		Hello, how nice to meet you.  And
		wouldn't it be nicer if my father
		would introduce you?

			     YOUNG MAN
			(to Allison)
		'...How nice to meet you.'

			     PARRISH
		Oh, I'm sorry.  This is my daughter,
		Allison, and her husband, Quince,
		Drew, my number one, works with me...

	Parrish drifts off as the Young Man awkwardly shakes hands
	with each person.

			     ALLISON
			(prompting)
		Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?

			     PARRISH
		A name?

			     DREW
			(pleasantly, going
			 along with the joke)
		Yeah, something he goes by --

			     PARRISH
		Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh --
		this is --

			     ALLISON
		Daddy!  Come on, a name.

			     DREW
		Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing
		me.

			     PARRISH
		Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone
		right out of my head --

			     DREW
		What?!

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I'm sorry.  This is - uh - uh...

	The group waits patiently.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Joe!

			     ALLISON
		Joe...

	Parrish once more drifts into silence.  (The YOUNG MAN is now
	identified as "JOE".)

			     DREW
		Just plain 'Joe'?

			     ALLISON
		Love that name.

			     QUINCE
		Me, too.  Hey, buddy!

	Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew
	squints observingly at Joe.

			     DREW
		'Joe...'

			     PARRISH
		Yes.

			     DREW
		Is there any more to it?

			     PARRISH
			(alarmed)
		What do you mean?

			     DREW
		Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'

	Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name,
	a furtive glance at Joe.  Parrish's brow darkens and a name
	tumbles from his lips:

			     PARRISH
		-- Black.

			     ALLISON
		Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you,
		Mr. Black.

			     QUINCE
		'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost
		two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in
		1952.

			     JOE
		Yes?

			     QUINCE
			(to Joe)
		You bet.  I'm kind of my Rotisserie
		League.

			     JOE
		Are you?

			     PARRISH
		He is!  Let's sit down --

	Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which
	was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.
	Joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his uten-
	sils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at
	his foot.

			     ALLISON
			(to Joe)
		Paillarde of veal.

			     QUINCE
		Yeah, they hit the calf over the
		head with a mallet and then Luisa
		hits it again in the kitchen.

			     ALLISON
		Honey --!

			     QUINCE
		You know what I'm saying, Joe?

			     JOE
		No --

			     PARRISH
			(laughing emptily)
		Joe knows what you're saying, just
		being polite --

	Drew is studying Joe.

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		Have we met?

			     PARRISH
		Uh -- he's from out of town --

			     QUINCE
		How long you here, Joe?

			     JOE
		As long as it takes.

	Drew is provoked by the response, but remains polite:

			     DREW
		You and Bill old friends?

	Parrish jumps in:

			     PARRISH
		No --

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		I get the feeling you've done some
		business before.

			     JOE
		We have an arrangement now.

			     DREW
		What side of the industry did you
		say you were on?

			     JOE
		I didn't say.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I
		have the feeling you guys got the
		broad strokes already.  Need any
		help with the details?

	Parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		I'm sorry -- business at dinner...
			(to Joe)
		Forgive me for being so rude.

			     JOE
		Sure.

	The doors to the dining room open, Susan appears.

			     SUSAN
		Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -
		had to have dinner with my depart-
		ment chief --

			     ALLISON
		You ate?

			     SUSAN
		...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't
		miss a loose end meeting.  What's on
		the table for discussion?  Party
		favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --

	She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob-
	viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water
	toys and their lips meeting mid-air.

	At the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is
	present and has been watching.  She is shocked, embarrassed,
	pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		What are you doing here?

	Silence.

			     PARRISH
			(stunned)
		You know each other?

			     SUSAN
			(lightly)
		We've met.

			     PARRISH
		What?!

			     SUSAN
		-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee
		Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.

			     QUINCE
		Well, I guess he's found one.

			     DREW
		Joe, you do get around.

	Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction.

			     SUSAN
		That's your name?

			     ALLISON
		And isn't it a lovely one?  So
		sturdy, so straight --

	Joe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her,
	doesn't answer.

			     DREW
		Incidentally, Joe, where're you
		staying?

			     JOE
		Here...

			     DREW
		'Here'?

			     SUSAN
		In this house?

			     QUINCE
		Great!

	Parrish pushes his plate away.

			     PARRISH
		Uh - will that hold you, Joe?

			     SUSAN
		Incidentally, 'Joe' what?

			     JOE
		Black.

			     QUINCE
		Hey, this is fun.

			     SUSAN
		So, what are you doing here?

	Parrish tenses, but Joe doesn't answer.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Cat got your tongue?  You weren't so
		silent this morning.

	Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy.

			     ALLISON
		Now, I'm getting interested.  I want
		to know more ---

			     PARRISH
			(to Joe)
		We've got some things to discuss.

	Parrish stands, motions for Joe to rise.

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		-- Did I hear 'business'?

			     SUSAN
		What 'business'?

			     QUINCE
		Don't bother asking, we already
		tried.

			     JOE
		It's so very nice to see you again.

			     SUSAN
		Funny, I don't get that feeling.
		Maybe it's because you found out
		I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

			     PARRISH
		Cut it out, Susan.
			(to Joe)
		You and I've got to talk.  Big day
		tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.

	Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops:

			     JOE
			(to Susan)
		Susan.
			(to Allison)
		Allison.
			(to Quince)
		Quince.
			(to Drew)
		Drew.
			(to Parrish)
		Bill...
			(to the group)
		Thank you.

	He makes an awkward little bow, then heads for the nearest
	door.

			     PARRISH
		Joe, that's the kitchen.

			     JOE
		Thank you.

	Joe pivots, and he follows Parrish out the proper door.

			     DREW
		That was 'Joe'.

			     ALLISON
		He's cute.

			     DREW
		Very.

	Susan's eyes are still on the door where Joe exited, her
	face reflecting her irritation and bewilderment, as well as
	a tinge of excitement.

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish leads the way, Joe beside him as they progress through
	the huge house.

			     PARRISH
		...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon-
		certed, that stuff between you and
		Susan -- uh -- threw me.

			     JOE
		'Threw' you?  Where?

			     PARRISH
		Shook me up.  I mean that you knew
		her and everything --

			     JOE
		I didn't know her.  The body I took
		knew her.  The man she met in the
		coffee shop this morning.  I - uh -
		took him.

			     PARRISH
		So there's nothing between you and
		Susan?

			     JOE
		No.

			     PARRISH
		I wish you had said something to me
		about staying here --

			     JOE
		It hadn't occurred to me until then.
		I was just having such a wonderful
		time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm
		here for?

	Parrish suddenly looks very anxious, Joe stops.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		You seem uncomfortable, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		No, I'm okay with this - uh - I
		think.  So --

	He opens a door.

	INT. MASTER GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

			     PARRISH
			(to Joe)
		Bathroom...tub...towels, sauna --

	Parrish turns back to the bedroom.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		...Chair, lamp, bed --

	Parrish is in a stunned state, chatters on unconsciously:

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Box springs, they're assembled in
		Jakarta.  Had to stay in a station
		manager's house there unexpectedly
		- best night's sleep I ever had.
		Ordered twenty, they filled a con-
		tainer and shipped them right over,
		I've put one in every bedroom here
		and in the country.

	Joe tests the springs.

			     JOE
		What a good idea.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you.  Would you like the man's
		name?

			     JOE
		No.

	Parrish glances around, a room in which the occupant could
	not want for anything.

			     PARRISH
		If there is anything else, don't
		hesitate --

			     JOE
		I won't.

			     PARRISH
		How long have I got?

			     JOE
		You're putting me on the spot, Bill.

	A moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Let's put it this way.  When I go,
		you go.

			     PARRISH
		When you go, I go.

			     JOE
		That's the best I can do.
			(a moment)
		...but minute-by-minute, I find
		myself lingering.

			     PARRISH
		...I just saw my doctor, he told me
		everything was fine.

			     JOE
		Your doctor?
			(icily)
		Did your doctor say anything about
		a tiny, undetectable hole in your
		aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab-
		ly weak vein in the further reaches
		of your famous brain?  Were they any
		prognostications about the possibil-
		ilites of a fatal collision on a golf
		cart of suffocating in an avalanche
		on a skin vacation in Gstaad?

			     PARRISH
		No --

			     JOE
		I hope you realize, Bill...in your
		office this morning, that was your
		time.

			     PARRISH
		Closer than that.

	Parrish keeps still, trying to cool the heat of Joe's
	temper.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		...But meanwhile, you are still
		here.  Count your blessings.  Call
		it gravy, frosting on the cake,
		whatever it is you say.

			     PARRISH
		Well, thank you for letting me know.

			     JOE
		Not at all.

			     PARRISH
		And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.

			     JOE
		Good night to you, Bill.

	Parrish gently closes the door.

	Joe looks around, checks out his surroundings: curious,
	attentive.

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish, unsteady, starts back down the hall, Luisa appears.

			     LUISA
		...Miss Allison asked if you would
		like to have your dinner kept warm?

			     PARRISH
		No. Thanks, Luisa.

			     LUISA
		Very good, sir.

	Luisa turns:

			     PARRISH
		Luisa --

	She stops.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Mr. Black's luggage was misplaced by
		the airlines.  Would you mind get-
		ting a few things together for him?
		A couple of suits, some shirts,
		ties, underwear, shoes.  Have Coyle
		take his measurements off what he is
		wearing tonight.

			     LUISA
		Certainly, sir.

	Luisa nods, and heads back downstairs.  Parrish enters
	his den, takes a seat in his chair, stares into the middle
	distance, ruminates.

	INT. GUEST ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Joe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and
	wonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement
	window, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges
	on the bedroom door.  In the process he opens this door,
	steps out into the hallway.

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or
	Miro, a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature
	Ming vae, and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein
	of water.

	INT. KITCHEN HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	In the "back" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor,
	the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light.  Joe enters.

	INT. KITCHEN, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	The staff is at ease, some smoking, remains of food around.
	Coyle, the butler, has his back to Joe and does not see him
	for a moment.  In front of Coyle, an open jar of peanut but-
	ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of Wonder Bread.
	Joe is fascinated by the process.  Coyle suddenly hears the
	silence, looks up and see Joe, standing up embarrassedly.

			     COYLE
		Yes, sir?

			     JOE
		Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet
		you.

			     COYLE
		Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.

	The staff all mumble expansive "Good evening, sir"s to Joe.
	He motions to them to sit, they do but Coyle does not.  Coyle
	shifts from foot-to-foot, the staff is not used to having
	Parrish family or guests in this part of the house.

			     JOE
			(to Coyle)
		What are you eating.

			     COYLE
		You mean this, sir?

	Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly.

			     COYLE (cont'd)
		Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter.

			     JOE
			(carefully)
		'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.
			(a moment)
		You like it?

			     COYLE
		I would say, sir, it is right up
		there with Jif and Skippy.  But
		miles ahead of Peter Pan.
			(another moment)
		Like a taste?

	Joe nods, Coyle fashions a spoonful, offers it to Joe.  Joe
	swallows it.  But he has not yet found a comfortable way of
	masticating, his mouth and tongue go every which way, the
	staff observes him, fascinated.

			     COYLE (cont'd)
		You're a peanut butter man now, eh,
		sir?

			     JOE
		Yes, I am.  I thoroughly enjoyed
		this - uh - peanut butter.
			(to the staff)
		And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting
		you.

	Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast
	to the staff.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I'll be moseying on.

	He heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer-
	ful "Goodnight, Mr. Black"'s, his tongue again licking the
	edges of the spoon.

	INT. SWIMMING POOL, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

	A spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views
	of the skyline.

	Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black
	Speedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter.
	He observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as
	she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection
	from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is.

			     SUSAN
		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		I'm lost.

			     SUSAN
		-- Can't seem to escape you today.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry.

	Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder,
	points to a stack of towels.

			     SUSAN
		Hand me one of those, will you?

	Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the
	spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand,
	can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants
	the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and
	presents it to Susan.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		You must have something really big
		going on with my father --

			     JOE
		'Big'?

			     SUSAN
		You appear at his side out-of-the-
		blue, stay at his house, eat dinner
		with his family, it's practically a
		first.  You're in the red-hot center
		of big business and I thought you
		were a regular Joe.

			     JOE
		I am Joe.

			     SUSAN
		Not the one I met this morning, hit-
		ting on me in as nice a way as I've
		been hit on in a long time, but the
		moment you find out I'm my Dad's
		daughter, you act like a stranger.

			     JOE
		That is not my intention.

	Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter.

			     SUSAN
		What are your intentions?  To make
		little dreams in coffee shops, turn
		a woman's head, and I don't mind
		admitting it was turned, I liked it,
		but ten hours later I feel like a
		fool.  I don't get it.  You, my
		father, here in this house, the cof-
		fee shop, it's making me upset, and
		I don't like being upset.  Who are
		you anyway?  And what are you eating?

			     JOE
			(mumbles)
		Peanut butter.

	He finishes the spoonful.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		But it's gone now.

	He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in
	his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate.  Susan holds her
	hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the
	spoon on the table with the towels.  She watches, fascinat-
	ed, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his
	spoonful.

			     SUSAN
		You act like you never had peanut
		butter before --

			     JOE
		I haven't.

			     SUSAN
		-- What kind of childhood did you
		have?

			     JOE
		Do you love Drew?

			     SUSAN
		Come again?

			     JOE
		When you put your mouth to his,
		Susan, it seems a frequent thing.

			     SUSAN
		Drew is none of your damn business.
		Nor is where I put my mouth.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry.  Do you live here?

			     SUSAN
		No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then
		I'm going home.

			     JOE
		I guess what I'm trying to say is --
		I'd like us to be friends.

			     SUSAN
		I've got plenty of friends.

			     JOE
		I don't have any.

			     SUSAN
		I can see why.

	She finishes drying herself, drops the towel on a chair, and
	prepares to leave.

			     JOE
		...I didn't mean to offend you at
		dinner.  I'm not quite at home some-
		times with people.  I get busy doing
		- uh - what I do, and I don't seem to
		have developed --

	He drifts off.

			     SUSAN
		Yes --?

			     JOE
		I have a certain function to per-
		form, and that seems to take all
		of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh -
		I speculate - uh - I haven't left
		room for - uh - anything else.

			     SUSAN
		I'm sorry to say I know what you're
		saying.

	A moment.

			     JOE
		Susan?

			     SUSAN
		Yes?

			     JOE
		Did you know you have a wet spot on
		your shoulder?

	She glances at her shoulder, he grabs a towel, touches the
	drops of water, pats them dry, hands her the towel.  She
	flashes a nervous smile.

			     SUSAN
		Goodnight, Joe.

			     JOE
		Goodnight to you, Susan.

	Susan steps towards a door, Joe takes a step in the wrong
	direction, they almost walk into each other.  Now she takes
	a step in another direction, as does Joe, again they almost
	collide.

			     SUSAN
		Shall we dance?

	Joe is completely puzzled, finally Susan heads for one door,
	Joe for another.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Joe --

			     JOE
		Yes?

			     SUSAN
		I think you want to go to the west
		wing.  Through there.

	Susan indicates yet another door.

			     JOE
			(after a moment)
		Thank you.

	Joe redirects himself, goes to the door.  As they both are
	about to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each
	other across the pool, smile at catching each other's
	glances.  Joe exits.  For a moment Susan's eyes remain on
	the door through which he has gone.  Now she grips the towel
	over her shoulders, the one Joe gave her, pats the same spot
	he did.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NEXT MORNING

	Parrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with
	their morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away
	linen, dusting picture frames.  He nods and greets them as
	he strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle
	and Luisa.

	INT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

	Parrish knocks, waits a courteous moment, opens the door,
	finds Joe in an elegant shirt and trousers trying to tie his
	tie.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning.

			     JOE
		Good morning, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		How are you?  How're you feeling?

			     JOE
		'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you
		feel?

			     PARRISH
		Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well.
		This is crazy.  This is the left-
		field thing of all time.  What do I
		do?  What do I tell my family?

			     JOE
		Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything,
		Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we
		had last night.  I felt as if I were
		being treated like a person.  'Joe'
		this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile
		- Quince passed me the rolls -- no
		'rapture' or 'passion' or any of
		those mighty things you seem so
		intent on imparting, but I am cer-
		tain, should you - uh - say - uh -
		who I am - our adventure would end
		abruptly.

	Parrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing
	of silk stretching across his collarbone.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		But I did so enjoy your family.

	Parrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully.

			     PARRISH
		What about my family?  This 'adven-
		ture' involved only me, right?

	Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses
	to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Tell you what, you promised that it's
		going to be only me and --

			     JOE
		And what?

			     PARRISH
		And I won't tell anyone who you are.

			     JOE
		Sounds fair enough.

			     PARRISH
		It is a deal?

			     JOE
		A 'deal'?

			     PARRISH
		You give your word, I give mine --
		that we'll do what we say.  It's a
		truth exchanged between two people.

	A moment.

			     JOE
		Bill --

			     PARRISH
		Yes?

			     JOE
		You've got a deal.

	Parrish seems relieved.  He has now, with some difficulty,
	completed the tying of Joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on
	Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror.
	Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the
	balls of his feet, quite taken.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		This is great!
			(a moment)
		Now what do we do?

			     PARRISH
		Shake hands.

	Joe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish, but
	Parrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes
	it.  Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a
	broad smile.

	EXT. 5TH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	Parrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per-
	fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part
	of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work.  Parrish
	senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check-
	ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the
	top of corporate high-rises.

			     PARRISH
		You know, I got to thinking last
		night -- with you here, and seem-
		ingly occupied, how's your work
		going - uh - elsewhere?

	A flicker from Joe.  He has heard what Parrish has said, his
	eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but
	he is concentrating on Parrish's words.

			     JOE
		When you were shaving this morning,
		you weren't just shaving, right?

			     PARRISH
		What do you mean?

			     JOE
		You were hatching ideas, making
		plans, arriving at decisions, right?

			     PARRISH
		I guess so.

			     JOE
		So you understand the concept then.
		When you're busy here, your work,
		what your task is, is being executed
		elsewhere.

			     PARRISH
		Of course.

			     JOE
		So you've grasped the idea.  Con-
		gratulations.  Now multiply it by
		infinity and take it to the depth
		of forever, and you still will
		have barely a glimpse of what I
		am talking about.

	Parrish falls silent, chewing over Joe's admonition.

			     PARRISH
		Joe --?

			     JOE
		Yes, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		How about giving a guy a break?

			     JOE
		Make an exception?

			     PARRISH
		There's one to every rule.

			     JOE
		Not this.

	They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home
	in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un-
	characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his
	lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:

			     PARRISH
		-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still
		young, this is not my time --

			     JOE
		That's what everybody says.

			     PARRISH
		I'm not everybody.

			     JOE
		That's what everybody says.

	Parrish is trying to control himself, glances at Joe.

			     PARRISH
		I want to live.

			     JOE
		I understand.

	A moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		But you can't.

	A sudden silence between them.  Parrish's shoulders appear
	to have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais-
	ing these issues has vanished.

			     PARRISH
		What's it like?

			     JOE
		What do you mean?

			     PARRISH
		What's it like where I'm going?

			     JOE
		Can you keep a secret?

			     PARRISH
		Yes.

			     JOE
		So can I.

	They turn into Parrish's office building.

	INT. LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	As Parrish and Joe enter, Parrish is hailed by JAIME, the
	Elevator Starter.

			     JAIME
		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning, Jaime.

			     JAIME
		Knight's Reward in the 4th at
		Calder --

	A bemused Parrish walks on, Joe beside him, Jaime pursuing
	them.

			     JAIME (cont'd)
		-- A closer in today with cheap
		speed.  The colt will come from the
		clouds and boom!  Fifty-eight dollar
		horse.  I get you down, Mr. Parrish,
		just say the word.

			     PARRISH
			(smiles)
		I'm sorry, not today, Jaime.

	Parrish and Joe arrive at the bank of elevators.  Jaime,
	back at his post, hits a button.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
			(to Joe)
		You know, everyday I've walked into
		this building, Jaime gives me a
		horse.
			(a moment)
		I wonder if any of them won.

	The elevator materializes, Parrish and Joe step on.

	INT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN - DAY

	Parrish and Joe emerge from the executive elevator, Jennifer
	is waiting as usual with her pad, "Good morning"s, etc.  As
	Parrish strides down the hall, Joe right beside him, he passes
	instructions back to Jennifer who, scribbling, hurries along
	behind them.

			     PARRISH
		-- And call my family, I'd like them
		to come over for dinner tonight.

			     JENIFER
		Didn't the family get together last
		night --?

			     PARRISH
			(remonstrating, gently)
		Jennifer.

			     JENIFER
		Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.

	Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as
	Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room.

			     PARRISH
			(to Joe)
		Perhaps you would like to wait in my
		office --?

			     JOE
		No.

			     PARRISH
		What I'm trying to say is this is a
		Board meeting and you are not a mem-
		ber of the Board.

			     JOE
		I'm sure you'll see to it that it
		won't be a problem.

	Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for
	the doorknob.

	INT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	Parrish enters, Joe following right behind him.  A euphony
	of "Good morning"'s from the various members of the Board,
	including Quince.  Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe,
	right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pas-
	tries, he heads for them.

			     PARRISH
			(to the Board)
		-- This is Joe Black, a personal
		associate of mine - uh - he'll be
		joining us today.  I know it's --
		uh -- unusual, and my apologies --
		and Drew -- uh -- carry on.

	Immediately indications of surprise on Board members' faces at
	Parrish bringing in an 'observer', Drew's reaction guarded
	but intense.

			     DREW
			(after a moment, to
			 Joe)
		Nice to see you.  I didn't expect
		you, but certainly you can't get
		enough of a good thing.

			     JOE
		Thank you.

			     DREW
			(to the Board)
		The Board of Parrish Communications -
		is hereby called to order.  Our sole
		order of business is an acceptance
		of John Bontecou's generous offer
		and --

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		Do you have any more of these deli-
		cious cookies?

	A hushed silence at the inappropriateness of Joe's inter-
	ruption.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		And a cup of tea.  With milk, I
		think.  I'd like to try it English-
		style.  Yes, a cup of tea with milk.

			     DREW
		Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about
		some water?

			     JOE
		Why yes, thank you.

			     DREW
		Hot or cold.

			     JOE
		Cold.

			     DREW
		And a glass.

	Drew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's
	refreshments.

			     PARRISH
			(quietly, indicating a
			 chair)
		Would you like to sit down, Joe?

			     JOE
		Yes.

	Joe sits.

			     DREW
		To review -- we're really crossing
		the 't's and dotting the 'i's here.
		Bill had a great and conclusive
		meeting with John Bontecou yester-
		day, all that remains for us is to
		put it to a vote.

	Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from
	the Board at Drew's news.

			     PARRISH
			(emptily)
		Thank you, Drew.

	Parrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something
	official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous,
	reflective, deeply felt.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Umm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I
		was interested in meeting John yes-
		terday -- impressive... I suppose...
		But it did get me to thinking.  I
		started in this business because
		this is what I wanted to do.  I knew
		I wasn't going to write the Great
		American Novel, but I also knew
		there was more to life than buying
		something for a dollar and selling
		it for two.  I wanted to give the
		news to the world, and I wanted to
		give it unvarnished.  The more we
		all know about each other, the
		greater the chance we will survive.
		Sure, I want to make a profit, you
		can't exist without one but John
		Bontecou is all profit.  If we give
		him license to absorb Parrish
		Communications, and he has his eye
		on a few others after us, we'll be
		appointing him to the position he
		craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to
		reach the world you will have to go
		through John Bontecou.  And not only
		will you have to pay him to do this,
		far more expensive, you'll have to
		agree with him.  Reporting the news
		is a privilege and a responsibility
		and it is not exploitable.  Parrish
		Communications has earned this priv-
		ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy
		it.  As your chairman, I urge you to
		agree this company is not for sale.

	A silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is
	trying to maintain his balance.

			     DREW
			(carefully)
		...Sounds like you're not leaving
		much room for discussion.

			     PARRISH
			(to the Board)
		Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm
		reversing my field.

			     DREW
		That's your privilege, Bill.  But
		given our needs, given the absolute
		necessity for growth, given the fu-
		ture, the truth is... joining John
		Bontecou is every bit as certain as -
		Death and Taxes.

	Joe interjects:

			     JOE
		'Death and Taxes'?

	After a moment.

			     DREW
		Yes.

			     JOE
		"Death and Taxes"?

	Another moment.

			     DREW
		Yes.

			     JOE
		What an odd pairing.

			     DREW
		It's just a saying, Mr. Black,

			     JOE
		Of whom?

			     DREW
		It doesn't matter.

			     JOE
		Then why did you bring it up?

	Drew regards Joe.

			     DREW
		You're not familiar with the phrase,
		"In this world, nothing is certain
		but Death and Taxes"?

			     PARRISH
		I am now.

			     DREW
		Glad I could be of some help.

	The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by
	his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish, Drew
	coolly grasps the irritation of the members.  Parrish breaks
	the silence.

			     PARRISH
		Shall we adjourn?

			     DREW
		But the matter's still on the table,
		Bill --

	EDWARD SLOANE, a contemporary of Parrish's, has been warily
	silent, but extremely observant.  Protective of Parrish, and
	sensing his burgeoning difficulty, he interrupts:

			SLOANE
		Why don't we let it rest for the
		moment?  Give it some air?

			     PARRISH
		Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall
		we?

	Joe rises.

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		Those cookies were excellent.

	He exits with Parrish, the door closes behind them.  A BABBLE
	of disturbed reactions from the Board.

			     DREW
		Who is that guy?

	Drew grabs a telephone:

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Felicia?


			FELICIA (O.S.)
		Yes, sir?

			     DREW
		Get me a Field Background check on
		Joe Black.  Litigations. Bankrupt-
		cies.  Credit ratings.  The works.
		Got it?

	Drew hangs up.

	INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY

	Parrish enters, Joe right on his heels.  They booth stop,
	Parrish regards him.

			     PARRISH
		-- What's the deal here?  Are you
		going to be breathing down my neck
		right 'til the very end?

			     JOE
		I don't understand.

	Parrish tries to gather himself.

			     PARRISH
		...I'd like to be alone for a while.

			     JOE
		Are you sad, Bill?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, I am.  There's a research lib-
		rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't
		you go down and read some magazines?

			     JOE
		You're not thinking of going some-
		where, are you, Bill?

			     PARRISH
		Joe, could I ask you to take a walk?
		Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll
		be seeing you.

			     JOE
		Of course.

	But Joe doesn't move.

			     PARRISH
			(prompting)
		Now I'd like to be alone.

			     JOE
		Oh.  Okay.

	Parrish reaches into his pocket and hands Joe some cash.

			     PARRISH
		Here -- this will hold you for a
		while.

	Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		You know about money, don't you?

			     JOE
		It can't buy happiness?

	Parrish opens the door.

			     PARRISH
		Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of
		the city.

			     JOE
		No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.

	Joe goes.

	INT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

	Susan is busy giving instructions to a Nurse, a patient on
	an examining table beside them.  As she finishes, she
	suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception
	area.  She is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last
	notation, hands a chart to the Nurse and heads down the
	corridor.

			     SUSAN
		Joe --

			     JOE
		How nice you look.  Is that your
		uniform?

	Susan regards him.

			     SUSAN
		Why did you come here?

	Joe doesn't have an answer.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Are you ill?

			     JOE
		Oh goodness, no.

			     SUSAN
		Then why are you here, Joe?

			     JOE
		I came to see you.

			     SUSAN
		I don't have any time to see you
		now.  I'm doing grand rounds and
		then I'm examining back-to-back
		patients until dinner and then --

			     JOE
		Very well, I'll watch.

			     SUSAN
		Watch me do what?

			     JOE
		Whatever you do.

			     SUSAN
		That's impossible.  I'm a doctor,
		I'm --

			     JOE
		And I'll be a visitor.

			     SUSAN
		Patients have visitors, not doctors.

			     JOE
		I don't mind --

	Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid-
	thirties, TEENA, an arm around her mother, EASTER, who is
	holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat,
	in great pain.

			     TEENA
			(urgently)
		Miss?  Miss Doctor?

			     SUSAN
			(gently)
		Just a minute, please.

			     TEENA
		Please.  My momma's sicker'n he
		is.

	Easter looks up and sees Joe.  She abruptly becomes still,
	eyes wide, as if sudden recognition.

			     EASTER
		Obeah.

			     TEENA
		No, Momma.

	But Easter just stares at Joe, fearful.

			     EASTER
		Obeah mon.  I gonna die.

			     TEENA
		Momma, stop it. Is just a man.

	Joe looks at Easter, curiously.

			     SUSAN
			(to Teena)
		What's obeah?

			     TEENA
		Bad spirit.  She just all fever, she
		don' mean nothin'.  Please help us?

			     SUSAN
		Have you filled out the insurance
		forms?

	Teena shakes her hand anxiously.  Joe leans forward to
	Easter and speaks softly in perfect, lilting West Indian
	dialect.

			     JOE
		No obeah, sister.  No duppy, no
		jumbie.  Evera ting gon' be irey.

	Susan and Teena both look at him, astonished.  Easter's
	fearful gaze remains locked on him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Go wi' de doctor lady.  Momma be
		fine.

			     EASTER
		Don' leave!?

			     TEENA
			(pleading)
		Momma.

	Susan leads Teena away.  Easter is riveted on Joe.

			     EASTER
			(with certainty)
		Obeah.

			     JOE
		Obeah evil.  I not evil.

			     EASTER
		What you then?

			     JOE
		I from dat nex' place.

			     EASTER
		You wait here'n to take us?  Like
		you bus driver to dere?

			     JOE
			(smiles)
		No, no.  I on holiday.

			     EASTER
			(looks around, dubious)
		Some spot you pick.

	She winces with pain, gasping.

			     EASTER (cont'd)
		Pain is bad.

			     JOE
		I nuttin' to do wi' dat.

			     EASTER
		Make it go 'way.

			     JOE
		Doctor lady make it irey.

			     EASTER
		Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru.
		Make it go 'way.

			     JOE
		Can't, sistah.

			     EASTER
			(adamant, pleading)
		Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex'
		place.

	Joe regards Easter, a long moment.

			     JOE
		Not time yet.

			     EASTER
		Make it time.

	Joe shakes his head, a firm no.  But when he looks and speaks
	to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret.

			     JOE
		Can't feel wi' de way tings gotta
		be, Easter.

	Susan and Teena return with an Orderly and a wheelchair for
	Easter.

			     EASTER
			(to Joe)
		Please...

			     TEENA
		Come now, Momma.

	Easter is helped into the wheelchair.  She looks pleadingly
	at Joe.  The Orderly starts to wheel her away.  Joe stays him,
	putting his hand on Easter's arm.

			     JOE
		Close your eyes, Easter.

	She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Soon.

	He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off.

			     SUSAN
			(to Teena)
		Go with her.  I'll be right there.

	Teena goes.  Joe remains his normal voice.

			     JOE
		She's in a great deal of pain.

			     SUSAN
		Yes.

	Susan regards Joe, puzzled.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Have you spent a lot of time in the
		islands?

			     JOE
		Some.

	Joe shifts.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I - uh - I - realize now - uh - my
		being here - um - your patient --
		this is not really appropriate --
		and I - uh --

			     SUSAN
		Don't apologize.  There's nothing
		to be sorry for -- every hospital
		should have someone like you.

	Silence.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Well...I'm glad you came.

			     JOE
		Thank you.  I'm so very glad to be
		here.

	Another awkward silence.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I guess you're busy --

			     SUSAN
		Yes.

	She doesn't move, they search for words.

			     JOE
		Well, I could come again some other
		time.

	Susan regards him.

			     SUSAN
		Joe, I'm with Drew.

			     JOE
			(sincerely)
		Not now.

	Susan smiles gently.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Don't you want me to come again...?

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		I have to go, I'm sorry to say --

			     JOE
		Be sorry for nothing.

	Another moment.

			     SUSAN
		Yes.  Well...thank you, Joe.

	Susan turns to go, hesitates.

			     JOE
		Good-bye, Susan.

	Susan waves softly to him, heads down the hall, glances back
	once to see Joe has not moved, is watching her depart.

	INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

	Jennifer shows Joe in, Parrish is deep in thought, beside
	him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and
	silver, but untouched.

	Joe is more abstracted than usual, he is starting at
	Parrish's food.

			     JOE
		Are you going to eat your lunch

			     PARRISH
		It's all yours.

	Joe starts eating, Parrish watches him, somewhat fascinated,
	Joe's chewing has improved.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Good?

			     JOE
		Excellent.  What is it?

			     PARRISH
		Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A
		little Coleman's mustard.

	Joe takes another big bite.

			     JOE
		Truly - uh - splendid.

			     PARRISH
		Glad you like it.  My wife turned me
		onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan --
		that was my wife --

			     JOE
			(familiarly)
		Uh-huh.

			     PARRISH
		Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy
		as roast beef, not as boring as
		chicken.  She knew stuff like that.

	Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		-- Everything reminds me of her --
		there isn't a day that goes by that
		I don't think about her -- One day
		she was here.  The next day she was
		gone.  What are you going to do? --
		I guess you've heard all this a
		trillion times before.

			     JOE
		And more.

			     PARRISH
		Why didn't you stop me?

			     JOE
		Well...I don't know.

	Silence.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		How was it the first time you met
		her?

			     PARRISH
		I thought you'd heard a trillion
		times --

			     JOE
		This part I'm interested in.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		She had on this little blue suit --
		with a little white collar that had
		little red piping on it --

	Joe is riveted on Parrish ow, Parrish aware of him, has
	paused.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		You could have put her under glass
		and I would have just stood and
		looked at her.  But when she spoke
		-- I loved the sound of her voice
		and her laugh --
			(a moment)
		-- I couldn't get enough of her --
		and gradually -- or maybe it wasn't
		gradually -- I realized I couldn't
		live without her.

	A KNOCK, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish,
	then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway.

			     DREW
		May I interrupting?

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     PARRISH
		No.

			     DREW
			(to joe)
		'Just kidding'?

			     PARRISH
		Sit down, Drew.

			     DREW
		Before I do --
			(glances at Joe)
		I was hoping we might be alone,
		Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Joe and I have no secrets from each
		other.

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		How nice for you both.

	Drew takes a moment, then plunges in.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Bill, pardon my candor, but I was
		confounded by your decision this
		morning.

			     PARRISH
		Why?

			     DREW
		I was hired, you told me, to help
		bring Parrish Communications into
		the 21st Century.  This merger is
		the vehicle --

	Joe interrupts:

			     JOE
		Perhaps a merger is a way to bring
		Bill's company into the 21st cen-
		tury.  And perhaps it isn't.  And
		perhaps cheating on your French
		Philosophers exam at The Groton
		School was an expedient way to get
		your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.
		Be that as it may, Drew, a question
		can often be argued both ways.

	Drew is stunned.

			     PARRISH
		Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		I thought this was practically a
		done deal --

			     PARRISH
		Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget
		Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of
		his fancy name and his fancy offer.
		I'm not going for it.

	A moment.

			     DREW
		Okay.

	Drew heads for the door, turns around.

			     DREW (cont'd)
			(to Parrish)
		Can I invite myself to dinner
		tonight?
			(a moment)
		Susan and I had ticket for the
		Knicks game.  But she said you
		guys were getting together --

			     PARRISH
		Dinner?  Absolutely.

			     JOE
		Absolutely.

			     DREW
			(to Joe)
		Damn decent of you.

	Drew exits.

			     JOE
		Why, at this juncture, are you
		letting yourself be so concerned
		by business matters?

			     PARRISH
		I don't want anybody buying up my
		life's work and turning it into
		something it wasn't meant to be.  A
		man wants to leave something behind.
		And he wants it left behind the way
		he made it.  And he wants it to be
		run the way he run it -- with a sense
		of honor, of dedication, of truth.
		Okay?

			     JOE
		Okay.

			     PARRISH
		And I don't need your goddamn permis-
		sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't
		need anyone to tell me how to run my
		life.

			     JOE
		Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a
		heart attack and ruin my vacation.

	INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	The skyline glitters through the terrace windows.  The hour
	is before dinner, Coyle and Luisa weave seamlessly among the
	family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray.

	Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a
	distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace.  Joe's eyes
	are on Susan across the room.  Her eyes flicker towards him,
	aware of his gaze.

			     ALLISON
			(to Susan)
		...We're never all together two
		nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas,
		Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's
		going on?

			     SUSAN
		Nothing's going on.  Maybe he
		doesn't want to be alone.  He's go-
		ing to be sixty-five in a minute --

			     ALLISON
		...I don't know, Daddy seems funny
		to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's
		like he dropped from the clouds...

	Drew enters.  He nuzzles Susan's neck, out of the corner of
	her eye she sees Joe still observing them.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		...When Daddy walked in with him, he
		couldn't even remember his name.  Now
		he's his house guest.  And you know
		how he hates house guests.  What is
		going on?

	Drew, whose eyes have also been on Joe across the room, turns
	back.

			     DREW
			(to Susan and Allison)
		Good question.

	Allison sees Susan's eyes flicker over towards Joe.

			     ALLISON
		-- But he does seem very nice.

			     SUSAN
		You think so?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Over at the terrace, Quince buttonholes Parrish, Joe stand-
	ing by.

			     QUINCE
			(to Parrish)
		...I read you all the way on the
		Bontecou thing, and I know where
		you're coming from.  And I'm with
		you a hundred and one percent.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		But I've got to tell you, if mergers
		are in the wild, I've got some great
		prospects I've developed.  I want to
		talk to you about them next week.

			     PARRISH
		Next week?

			     QUINCE
		Yeah.  Or the week after.

	Quince sees Parrish hesitate.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
		No good?

			     PARRISH
		No, anything is possible.
			(lightly)
		It's up to Joe.

			     QUINCE
		Joe, you don't know how glad I am
		you're aboard.  Anybody who can take
		some of the weight off the old man,
		I'm in his corner.

			     JOE
		That's very gracious of you, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		No problem.  I'll leave you two
		alone.  I can tell you guys have
		something on the fire --

	An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as
	Allison appears.

			     ALLISON
			(to Parrish)
		Did you know twenty-six members of
		your rifle company are coming?

			     PARRISH
		Who?

			     ALLISON
		From the Korean War.

			     PARRISH
		Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.

			     ALLISON
		Whatever it was, they'll be here.
		We sent out invitations to everyone,
		plane tickets included -- the RSVP's
		are amazing.  A few of them we didn't
		hear from, and some of them are dead,
		of course --

			     PARRISH
		Of course.

			     ALLISON
			(a moment)
		You know, we're going to give this
		party for you whether you like it or
		not.

			     PARRISH
		I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I
		don't seem more appreciative.

			     ALLISON
			(resignedly)
		That's okay, Daddy.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Across the room, Quince has pulled Drew aside:

			     QUINCE
		...I know you're down, but you know
		when you're down, Drew, there's no
		place to go but up.

			     DREW
		Thanks, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some
		other merger possibilities up my
		sleeve, and I'm putting them to see
		old man.

			     DREW
		Are you?

			     QUINCE
		We'll do it together.  I'll clue you
		in.  Timing's got to be right.  The
		old man says it's up to Joe.

			     DREW
		'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his
		words?

			     QUINCE
		Yeah.

			     DREW
		'It's up to Joe', huh?

			     QUINCE
		Yeah, that's what he said.

			     DREW
		Well, that's very interesting.

	Drew gazes intently over at Joe who is crossing to Susan,
	for the moment by herself near the piano.

			     QUINCE
		I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat
		guy.

			     DREW
		Yeah.  Neat.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Joe approaches Susan.

			     JOE
		I wanted to apologize, Susan --

			     SUSAN
		I thought you said 'Be sorry for
		nothing'.

			     JOE
		Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding
		on you this afternoon.

			     SUSAN
		It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it
		was, it turned out to be welcome.

			     JOE
		I appreciate you --

			     SUSAN
		Excuse me?

			     JOE
		I mean I appreciate that.

			     SUSAN
		And I appreciate you, too.

	A moment between them.

			     JOE
			(delighted)
		You do?  Well, thank you very much.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Drew crosses over to Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		I was a little abrupt with you this
		afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want
		you to know I value your advice.

			     DREW
		As much as Joe's?

	Parrish doesn't answer.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Who is this man?  He's giving
		ubiquitous a bad name.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		You're competitive soul, Drew.
		That's what makes you a great addi-
		tion to the money.  Joe is just...
		around.

			     DREW
		For how long?  And why?

			     PARRISH
		Please.  Don't worry about him.  And
		above all, don't antagonize him.

	Drew glances over at Joe.

			     DREW
		Boss's orders, huh?  I'm great at
		following them.  And I think I'll
		start right now.

	Allison calls out from the other side of the room:

			     ALLISON
		Dinner's ready, everybody!

	A BUZZ as Coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the
	family files in, Drew lingering behind with Joe.

			     DREW
		I have a confession to make to you,
		Joe.

	Joe just smiles in response.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Do you want to hear it?

			     JOE
			(pleasantly)
		No.

			     DREW
		Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.
		I did cheat on that exam at Groton.
		But so did twenty-six other guys,
		and nobody ever mentioned it until
		today.  And I'm expecting you won't
		mention it again.  I don't know who
		you are and where you're getting
		your information, but I'm willing to
		pretend I did not hear it, and let
		bygones be bygones.  But can I tell
		you something else, it'd be nice to
		see the big guy without you next to
		him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do
		you hold his dick for him when he
		goes to take a leak?  You know some-
		times somebody would like a few min-
		utes alone with W.P.  That means
		without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.

	INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances
	averted, Allison notices Susan and Joe looking at each
	other, Drew observes Parrish watching Joe, Quince, on the
	other hand, just eats.

	Breaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands.

			     PARRISH
		-- I - uh - want to thank you all
		for coming - uh - my family --

	Everyone at the table is all attention.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		-- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and
		the other members --

	He glances at Joe, stops.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		-- I'm so happy when we can get
		together -- I mean I know you all
		have busy lives --

			     SUSAN
		Look who's talking.

			     ALLISON
			(a laugh)
		Yeah, speak for yourself.

			     PARRISH
		Anyway -- I remember when you were
		little girls --

	An awkward pause.  Quince chooses to fill the silence.

			     QUINCE
		I love little girls --

	Allison elbows him.

			     PARRISH
		And now you're all grown up -- and
		I'm - uh - um --

	Parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, Drew
	clocking his behavior very carefully.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I had some words all prepared but
		now I've forgotten them - uh - um -
		wait a minute.

	Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Uh, it's gone...um -- it was on the
		tip of my tongue.

			     SUSAN
		It'll come back, Daddy.

			     PARRISH
		Will it?...

	Parrish looking around, searching for words he will not find.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Anyway, I'd like to go on but...

	He hesitates, drifts into silence.

			     ALLISON
			(tentatively)
		Daddy, you could sit down if you
		wanted to.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		There is so much I would like to say
		-- but I can't --
			(another moment)
		So I better sit down.  Carry on,
		everybody.

	He sits, then immediately stands up again.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		One other thing -- why don't we all
		have dinner again tomorrow night?

			     ALLISON
		Dinner?  Again?

			     SUSAN
		Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?

			     PARRISH
			(with great sincerity)
		No.

	The word lands with effect, Susan and Allison have heard it
	well.

			     SUSAN
		We'll be here.

			     QUINCE
		You bet.

			     ALLISON
		With bells on.

	The guests try to return to their food, Susan is the most
	concerned about Parrish's lapse, she does not say anything
	but Drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of
	a display, gives her a pro forma hug.  Joe has observed
	every instant of Drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable
	when Coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a
	roast that has been carved.

			     JOE
			(to Coyle)
		I would prefer some peanut butter.

			     COYLE
		How would you like that, sir?  On
		some kind of toast?

			     JOE
		Toast?  No...just the butter.

			     COYLE
		Right away.

	Coyle heads for the kitchen.

			     SUSAN
		Why do you love peanut butter so
		much?

			     JOE
			(intimately)
		I don't know.

			     SUSAN
		I adore things like that....food I
		can't do without.  Don't you?

	Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the
	room.

			     JOE
		Yes...

			     SUSAN
		It comforts you, doesn't it?

			     JOE
			(captivated)
		Yes...I've found that it does.

			     DREW
		Mind if I throw up?

			     PARRISH
			(admonishing gently)
		Please, Drew.

			     JOE
			(to Susan)
		I'm very concerned about the woman
		you attended to today.

			     SUSAN
		I am, too.

			     JOE
		Has her pain abated?

			     SUSAN
		We're doing what we can for her.
		But it doesn't look good.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry to hear that.

			     DREW
		Who are we talking about?

			     JOE
			(to Susan)
		But I know she's grateful for the
		care you're giving her.

			     DREW
		Is this a state secret or are we
		being excluded just for the fun of
		it?

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		Susan's patient is whom we are
		talking about.

			     SUSAN
		Joe visited the hospital today.

	Parrish's head swivels to Joe.

			     ALLISON
		Did he?  That's more than we get to
		do.

			     DREW
		Well, maybe next time Joe goes,
		he'll take us along.

			     JOE
		Perhaps you could remind me.

			     DREW
		I'll make a note of it.  Anything
		else?

			     QUINCE
		I'd like to come, too.  See Susan
		strut her stuff.

			     DREW
		You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination
		Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour
		Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to
		you?

	Silence.  Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects
	a sudden concern with their relationship.

			     JOE
		Susan is a wonderful doctor.

	INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	After dinner, the family and guests file back in from the
	dining room, Drew alongside Parrish.

			     DREW
		I have to go, Bill -- it's been a
		helluva day.  Need a few minutes to
		sort everything out.

			     PARRISH
		Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

			     DREW
		Sure.

	Drew peels off, heads for the foyer and front door, Susan
	follows him.

	Parrish corners Joe.

			     PARRISH
		Why did you go to the hospital?

			     JOE
		I don't know.

			     PARRISH
		You were just curious?

			     JOE
		I guess...

			     PARRISH
		About Susan?

			     JOE
		I wouldn't put it that way.

			     PARRISH
		What way would you put it?

			     JOE
		You tell me, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		How about you telling me?  When I
		ask a simple question, I expect a
		straight answer.  That's what I'm
		used to.  Anybody who doesn't give
		it to me, I fire.

			     JOE
		Are you going to fire me, Bill?

	Silence, Parrish is at a loss.

	INT. FOYER - NIGHT

	Drew is putting on his coat, Susan with him, a tension between
	them, a heavy silence finally broken.

			     SUSAN
		...See you tomorrow night.

			     DREW
		Include me out.  I've had enough of
		the conversations.

			     SUSAN
		You don't mean that.  You wouldn't
		disappoint Daddy --

			     DREW
		Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got
		Joe.
			(a moment)
		And so do you.

			     SUSAN
		Drew, you're out of line.

			     DREW
		That may be.  But I don't like the
		fucker.  I don't like the way he
		looks at you and talks to you.  And
		vice versa.

			     SUSAN
		Sorry, but I like the way he looks
		and talks to me.  And vice versa.
		Okay?

			     DREW
		No, not okay.  I thought we had a
		good thing going here.
			(a moment)
		It shows you never know.

	Silence, neither knows how to continue.

			     SUSAN
		Well... goodnight.

			     DREW
		Yeah.  Goodnight.

	Drew goes, Susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer,
	he's been observing them.  She walks up to him.

			     SUSAN
		How long have you been standing
		there?

			     JOE
		I don't like the way Drew spoken to
		you.  But I feel better about it now
		because of the way you spoke back.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		Tell me about yourself, Joe.  Who
		you are.  What you're doing with my
		father.

	Susan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		So you're not going to tell me?

	Joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's
	inquiries.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		You're married, aren't you?

			     JOE
		Why?

			     SUSAN
		Because guys who never say anything
		about themselves are always married.

	Joe doesn't respond.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		So you are married.

			     JOE
		No, I'm not.

			     SUSAN
		Girlfriend?

			     JOE
		No.

			     SUSAN
		Gay?

			     JOE
		No.

	Susan comes closer to Joe.

			     SUSAN
		Then tell me, Joe, how come a man
		as attractive, intelligent, well-
		spoken ,diffident in the most sed-
		uctive way, and yet powerful, is all
		alone in this world?

	Joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted
	by Susan.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I'm sorry, I don't want to pry and
		you don't want to tell me.  So let's
		leave it a mystery.  That's the way
		you want it, isn't it?

	Susan takes another step closer to Joe.

			     JOE
		Thank you, I appreciate that.

	They are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds
	them, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the
	stairs.

			     SUSAN
		Where are you going?

			     JOE
			(softly)
		To bed.

			     SUSAN
			(suddenly fragile)
		'To bed'?

			     JOE
		Yes.  I'm tired.

	He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the
	stairs, Susan watches him disappear.

	She turns back into the salon just as Allison and Quince are
	exiting, "good-byes" all around.  Susan is left alone now
	with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar.

			     PARRISH
		That was wonderful.

			     SUSAN
		Yeah, it's good to get together.

			     PARRISH
		Do you mind if I raise a little
		caution flag?

			     SUSAN
		Raise away.

			     PARRISH
		What is the nature of your interest
		in Joe?

			     SUSAN
		Well, remember how you told me about
		"lightning striking"?  The nature of
		it's in there somewhere.

	Parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink, takes his
	time before answering.

			     PARRISH
		I won't say you may be getting onto
		shaken ground --

			     SUSAN
		Then what will you say?

			     PARRISH
		I don't think this is the lightning
		you are looking for.  Drew's a good
		man.  I know I didn't seem to be
		completely in his corner before, but
		I've come to appreciate --

			     SUSAN
		Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo-
		ten?  What's going on?

			     PARRISH
		Nothing.

			     SUSAN
		When you say 'nothing' that way,
		it's not nothing.

			     PARRISH
		Then what is it?

			     SUSAN
		It's something.

	She kisses him.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		G'night, Daddy.  See you tomorrow.
		This is getting interesting.

	She goes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. THE CARLYLE HOTEL - NEXT DAY

	A large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of
	coffee and half-eaten pastries.  The Board of Parrish
	Communications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince.
	Felicia, Drew's secretary, takes notes.

			     DREW
		...I know you're all as uncomfor-
		table as I am to be meeting without
		Bill, but I got a call last night
		from John Bontecou.  Not only is he
		still interested, he is sweetening
		his offer.
			(a moment)
		Although it pains me to say it, in
		my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with
		us peremptorily in dismissing any
		deal with Bontecou.  Therefore, I'm
		sorry to say that if we are to exam-
		ine this new offer responsibly as
		the Board of Directors of Parrish
		Communications, we must do so with-
		out its Chairman.
			(another moment)
		Oh yes, there is one additional
		element: Bontecou is so anxious to
		get us, he said he'd take Parrish
		Communications with our Chairman or
		without.

	The Board falls silent.  Sloane, a peer of Parrish's,
	fidgets.  Drew milks the moment.

			     DREW (cont'D)
		It's no surprise if I suggest to you
		that the Bill Parrish we know is not
		the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.
		You heard that speech -- some strange
		emotional rationale to buttress a
		knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate
		offer.  Does it not strike you that
		something is possibly affecting this
		man's judgement?  More specifically
		-- his judgement to make a critical
		business decision?

	Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.

			     DREW (cont'D)
		It's not pleasant to say the follow-
		ing, but I would be remiss, in this
		crisis, if I did not.  When we pre-
		sent Bill with the improved Bontecou
		offer, and if he refuses to let us
		consider it -- once more makes an
		adamant or emotional rejection -- we
		will have no choice but to seek an
		alternative.

			     SLOANE
		And what would that be?

			     DREW
		Bill's birthday is the day after
		tomorrow.  There is a provisory by-
		law in our charter.  Per the discre-
		tion of the Board, Corporate off-
		icers can be retired at age sixty-
		five.

			     SLOANE
		You're taking this too far, Drew.

			     DREW
		Am I not obligated to?

	Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves
	the room.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		How did this all come about?  Crisis
		-- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-
		pany, crisis for us.  I came about
		with the arrival on the scene of --
		Mr. Joe Black.  Mr. Joe who?  Joe
		Black.  He attends our Board meet-
		int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-
		sides in his office.  Never leaves
		his side.  And, in my opinion, is
		always in his ear.  Telling him what
		to do and Bill is listening.  Who is
		Joe Black?  What is his relationship
		to Bill Parrish?  And most important,
		what is behind his influence on our
		Chairman?

			     SLOANE
		You're building this thing up too
		much, Drew.  He's had advisors be-
		fore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do.

	The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur-
	prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.

			     DREW
		Thank you for coming.

			     SLOANE
		Hello, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know
		everybody was going to be here, what
		a nice surprise.  What's the big
		confab?

			     SLOANE
			(acidly)
		This is a secret meeting.

			     DREW
			(to Quince)
		I hope you'll respect its nature --
		What we're trying to do here is
		gather our thoughts -- in light of
		Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer
		-- and make an appropriate presenta-
		tion to him as to how we think the
		company might proceed.  Won't you
		share with our Board the information
		you gave me last night?

	Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.
	He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the
	Board.

			     QUINCE
		Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got
		good news.  As I was telling Drew,
		I've been making a little hay while
		the Bontecou sun was shining -- two,
		possibly three new and boiling hot
		prospects for merger.

			     DREW
		How did Bill react to the leads
		you've developed?

			     QUINCE
		He was interested.

			     DREW
			(prompting)
		-- But he was concerned about the
		timing?

			     QUINCE
		The timing -- yes.  He says it's up
		to Joe.

			     DREW
		'It's up to Joe'?

			     QUINCE
		That's what he said.

	Quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly
	around at the Board members.  They are stunned, Sloane in
	shock.  Drew is absolutely still, letting Quince's words
	sink in.

	INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish, Joe, Susan, Allison and Quince are seated at the
	table, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside.
	Allison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some
	clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet
	again.  Parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks
	over his demi-tasse cup at Joe, Parrish aware of Joe's
	heightened interest in Susan, and Susan's reciprocation.

	Coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with
	cakes on them, Luisa follows with one other.  They set them
	down in front of Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		What is this?

			     ALLISON
		Annie made them.

			     PARRISH
		Who's Annie?

			     ALLISON
		From La Rosette, only the greatest
		pastry chef in America.
			(pointing)
		This is orange, from real Seville
		oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille
		crust, a little on the fanciful.
		And a while, nothing like a good old
		white cake, vanilla, with Angel food
		but some maroons shavings thrown in.

			     PARRISH
		I don't like cake.

			     ALLISON
		It's for the party, Dad --

			     PARRISH
		Oh, the goddam party --

			     ALLISON
		'Goddam party'!

	Allison bursts into tears.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
			(to Quince)
		Did you hear that?

	Quince quickly slashes a piece, takes a huge bite.

			     QUINCE
		This is great, honey.  The orange.
		Has it got a little vodka in it?
		Like that Finnish stuff, orange
		vodka --
			(to Parrish)
		Put your lips around this one, Bill.
		It's out of this world.

			     PARRISH
		No thank you, Quince.
			(to Allison)
		I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at
		this.  Why don't you choose whatever
		cake you like?

			     ALLISON
		I knew you were going to say that.
		Tito Puente.  The old platoon.  Now
		the cake.  You just don't care.  Why
		did I do this?  I should have my head
		examined.  I'm trying to throw the
		party for the century for my father -
		and you know what -- he doesn't give
		a shit.

	She bursts into tears all over again.

			     QUINCE
		But he does give a shit.  Don't you,
		Bill?

			     PARRISH
		Yeah, I give a shit.

			     QUINCE
		See.  There.  What'd I tell you?

	Joe watches as Quince dabs at Allison's tears with a napkin.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
		Feel better?

			     ALLISON
		Yeah, but --

			     QUINCE
		But what?

			     ALLISON
		What will I tell Annie?

	Parrish forks a bit of a cake.

			     PARRISH
		This one.

			     QUINCE
		The vodka.  What'd I tell you?

	Quince puts a reassuring arm around Allison, she seems to
	relax now, Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans-
	pired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a
	sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation-
	ship.

	INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	After dinner, Parrish, Allison and Susan are gathered to-
	gether.  At the bar on the other side of the room, Joe
	watches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy.

			     JOE
			(to Quince)
		Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth
		leading killer of adult Western
		males.

			     QUINCE
		I didn't know that.

			     JOE
		On the other hand, Winston Churchill
		drank a bottle of cognac a day and
		lived until he was ninety-one.

	After a moment.

			     QUINCE
		You're an original, Joe.  A little
		hard to figure, maybe...

			     JOE
		And you're a nice man, Quince.

			     QUINCE
		Thanks.

			     JOE
		You're welcome.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Drew appears unannounced in the doorway, exchanges a tense
	glance with Susan, then heads straight for Parrish who seems
	surprised to see him.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've
		got a bit of a crisis downtown --
		it's not something we could talk
		about on the phone.

	Parrish takes Drew aside.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		The Board's real unhappy, Pappy --
		they felt you dealt with them pre-
		emptorily, you never gave them a
		chance to speak --

			     PARRISH
		What is there to say?  They know
		what John Bontecou is -- and if they
		didn't, they know now.

			     DREW
		Yes, you made your feeling abun-
		dantly clear.  Now they want to do
		the same with theirs.

			     PARRISH
		What are their feelings?

			     DREW
		If I read this Board right now, they
		want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

			     PARRISH
		Over my dead body.

	Parrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of
	Joe, Susan, Quince and Allison.

			     DREW
		What do you think the Board is going
		to say when I tell them that?

			     PARRISH
		I don't care.

			     DREW
		With all due respect, you damn well
		better care because if you try to
		stonewall them again, there'll be
		blood on the floor.

	Silence, Parrish carefully calibrating Drew's remark.

			     PARRISH
		Whose?

			     DREW
		Yours.

			     PARRISH
		I'm feeling real uncomfortable right
		now because the guy who reports to
		me is threatening me.

			     DREW
		I'm just giving you the truth.  There
		was a time when William Parrish liked
		the truth.

	Joe, although across the room, is all attention.

			     PARRISH
		I think it's time you went home,
		Drew.

			     DREW
		Certainly.  Goodnight.

	Drew goes, everybody is in shock, Susan pursues him out into
	the hallway.

			     SUSAN
		Drew!

	He stops.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Never talk to my father like that
		again.

			     DREW
		Don't worry about it.  There's a
		beginning and a middle and an end
		to everything.  And I think I've
		come to the end of my chapter with
		the Parrishes.

	Joe has followed them into the hallway.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		And the end began with this guy.

	Drew looks down towards Joe.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Mr. Black --?  We ran a check on you
		and you know what we came up with?

			     JOE
		No, I don't --

			     DREW
		Not good, not bad, you know what we
		got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars,
		no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.

	Joe waits.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		All of a sudden a guy appears on the
		scene with the Chairman of one of
		the greatest communications corpora-
		tions of the world, the boss makes
		him privy to all the company's
		secrets, he attends the Board meet-
		ings, and us working stiffs with
		MBA's up the ass and years and years
		and years of experience, we're left
		outside with our noses pressed
		against the window.

	Joe doesn't respond.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		This is a big-time operation, deal-
		ing in big-time issues, demanding
		big-time executives who make big-
		time decisions.  So, Joe, why don't
		you tell me exactly what it is
		that's big time about you?

	After a moment.

			     JOE
		You first.

			     SUSAN
			(to Drew)
		Why don't you get off his case?

			     DREW
		Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney
		now?  Are we going to go to court?
		Or are we going to go to bed?  And I
		don't mean you and me.  I mean you
		and him.

			     SUSAN
		That's it.  It's over.  Get out.

			     DREW
		So I guess a blowjob's out of the
		question?

	Joe clears his throat.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Did you say something?

	Joe considers him evenly.

			     JOE
		Almost.

			     SUSAN
			(to Drew)
		I said get out.

	Now Drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with
	a SLAM.

			     JOE
		What an angry fellow.

	A moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone,
	and Joe does as well.

			     SUSAN
		I'm sorry about --

			     JOE
		Please.  We don't need to talk about
		Drew.

	She regards Joe.

			     SUSAN
		No.  We don't.

	They drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Brave you had a chance to look at
		Dad's rare books?  Jefferson's
		Parliamentary Manual, a first
		edition Bleak House --

	Joe comes closer, takes a deep breath.

			     JOE
		I love your smell.

			     SUSAN
		-- I guess you haven't.

	Now Susan, close to Joe, leans closer, her nose in Joe's
	neck.  Joe holds himself very still.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I like your smell, too.

			     JOE
		Thank you.

			     SUSAN
		It was everything.

	Silence, the TICKING of the clock.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		When I was little, my mother used to
		say, "Darling, you could set your
		heart by this clock".

			     JOE
		-- Could you?

			     SUSAN
		Never tried, 'til now.
			(suddenly)
		Joe, may I kiss you?

			     JOE
		Why, yes.  Thank you.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		You're welcome.

	Susan reaches out for Joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his
	very awkwardness endearing.  Susan pulls him closer, they
	linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Thank you.

			     JOE
		You're welcome.

	The clock TICKS on.  A sense of foreboding falls over Joe's
	face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a
	point of no return.

			     SUSAN
		Joe?

	The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away.

			     JOE
		Yes?

			     SUSAN
		I don't know who you are.

			     JOE
		Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're
		Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak
		feeling in my knees --

			     SUSAN
		And is your heart beating strangely?

			     JOE
		Faster.  And I want the scent from
		underneath your ears and the taste
		of your lips and the touch of your
		tongue to stay with me -- forever.

	An intake of breath.  She is about to speak.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		And you don't even have to say a
		word.

	Their faces inches from each other's.

			     SUSAN
		I have to go home.

	But neither Susan nor Joe moves.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Don't I?

	Her question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile.  Susan
	takes the opportunity to step back from him.  The SOUND of
	someone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends
	immediately how the situation will appear to him.

			     SUSAN
		Goodnight, Daddy.

	She drifts right past him, exits.  Joe and Parrish are left
	alone now, eyes on each other's.

			     JOE
		Hello, Bill.

			     PARRISH
			(carefully)
		Hello.  Would you like to join me,
		Quince and Allison for a nightcap?

			     JOE
		Um -- not right now.

	An awkward moment.

			     PARRISH
		Okay.  Goodnight.

			     JOE
		Goodnight.

	Parrish turns and exits, Joe's head inclines, he breathes in
	the scent of his collar.

							CUT TO:

	INT. EXECUTIVE SUITE, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - NEXT DAY

	Parrish, followed by Joe, emerges from his private elevator,
	is greeted as usual:

			     JENIFER
		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning, Jennifer.

			     JENIFER
		The Board is waiting.

			     PARRISH
		What?

			     JENIFER
		Didn't you call a Board meeting?

	Jennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance, she
	knows better than to press the point.

			     JENIFER (cont'd)
		Yes, the members are waiting.  They
		are in the Board room now.

	Jennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesn't cast a flicker
	of any further surprise, heads straight for the Board room,
	Joe right beside him.

	INT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	Parrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, includ-
	ing Drew, Quince and Sloane.

			     PARRISH
		Good morning.

	An odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the
	same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting,
	its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob-
	lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.

			     DREW
		Did you want to have a cup of coffee
		or something, Bill?

			     PARRISH
		I don't think so.  Do you?

	Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out
	all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		To get to the point, we have re-
		ceived new information from John
		Bontecou concerning his desires for
		this company to merge with his, and
		we wanted to set the details before
		you.

	A moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it
	appears he may not ever answer.

			     PARRISH
		That's it?

			     DREW
		Bontecou wants a quick response
		and --

			     PARRISH
		The answer is no, quick enough for
		you?

			     DREW
		Don't you want to hear the details?

			     PARRISH
		I'm not interested in the details.
		And I'm not interested in the big
		picture either.  What I am inter-
		ersted in is how my Board got conven-
		ed behind my back, is entertaining a
		further proposal from a man whom it
		offends me to do business with,
		moreover has the audacity to present
		this to me like a prize fish, and I
		am expected to clap for it like a
		performing seal.  No, thank you.

			     DREW
		So I am to understand from your re-
		sponse that you do not want to hear
		the details of Bontecou's offer?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, you are to understand that, and
		now may I ask you a question?

			     DREW
		Certainly, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Are you running this Board or am I?

	Sloane leans in.

			     SLOANE
		We're not getting anywhere here.
		Why don't we take some of the best
		out of this thing, let's consider
		it coolly, let's take a week --

			     DREW
		Bontecou wants a speedier response
		than that.

			     SLOANE
		He'll wait --

			     PARRISH
		Doesn't need to.  Today, tomorrow,
		a week from now -- 'a week from
		now', who can think about a week
		from now -- the answer is going to
		be the same -- a loud, unmistakable,
		all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.

	A BUZZ amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence
	under Parrish's withering glance.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		That's it?  I've got a busy day
		and this meeting has already set
		me behind.  Shall we adjourn?

			     DREW
		Before we do, while we're here,
		there is a second question the
		Board would like a response to,
		a far simpler one.

	Parrish waits.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Who is the man sitting to the right
		of you?

	Everybody's eyes are on Joe.

			     PARRISH
		I've already introduced Mr. Black to
		you all.

			     DREW
		But who is he?  What are his creden-
		tials?  What is his relationship to
		you?

	No response from Parrish.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		The feeling of the Board is this: we
		fear Mr. Black is not only influenc-
		ing your decisions in regard to this
		company, but that you are relying on
		him to make them for you.

	Quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front
	of him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still
	does not answer.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		The lack of response, Bill, is not
		appropriate.  We are your Board, we
		have a right to know how you are
		managing the operations of this
		company, and most importantly, that
		you have not delegated someone to do
		it for you.

	Parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does
	not speak.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Okay, one more time.

	Drew regards Joe.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Who is Joe Black?

	Parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as
	Quince's head sinks into his hands.

			     DREW (cont'd)
			(to the Board)
		A motion has been brought before
		the Board to invoke Article 19 of
		the corporate charter.

			     PARRISH
		In English, please.

			     DREW
		Mandatory retirement upon our
		Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.

	Parrish is expressionless.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		At which time, the Chairman will be
		named Emeritus, he will be welcome
		to attend all meetings, and will
		serve as International Spokesman for
		the corporation plus, of course, a
		settlement, a golden parachute of
		such magnitude that his feet will
		never touch the ground.

	Drew pauses.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Please indicate your vote by a "Yes"
		or "No".

	A "Yes" is heard, now another "Yes", now more "Yes"es, all
	reluctant, "No" from Sloane, "No" from Quince who realizes
	he is the instrument of Parrish's dismissal.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		The motion is passed.  We will of
		course delay the announcement, out
		of respect for our former Chairman,
		until after the celebration of his
		birthday this weekend.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you for allowing me to save
		face, Drew.

	Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew.

			     DREW
			(to the Board)
		The other motion before us is the
		acceptance of John Bontecou's offer
		to merge this corporation with
		Bontecou International --

	Parrish stands, Drew stops speaking.

			     PARRISH
		Joe?

	Silence, then Joe rises.

			     JOE
			(to the Board)
		Who I am, and my relationship to
		Bill, will be divulged in our own
		good time.

	Joe follows Parrish out of the room.

	INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Sloane has pursued Parrish and Joe.

			     SLOANE
			(to Parrish)
		...It's not over, 'til it's over.

			     PARRISH
		Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"
		shit.

			     SLOANE
		I still sense some doubt in this
		group, we could turn it around.
		You'll be up in the country?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, the big 'celebration' of my
		mandatory retirement birthday.
		You're an honored guest, Eddie.

			     SLOANE
		I'm going to stick it out here.  We
		still have a shot.

	The elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside and the
	door closes, leaving Sloane behind.

	INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

	The Board meeting has broken up, clusters of members have
	lingered, exchanging post-mortems.  And enraged Quince has
	cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others.

			     QUINCE
		What have you done?  You've gotten
		the old man fired!

			     DREW
		That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was
		wobbling, mind you, but you stupid
		the coup de grace.

	Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality.

			     QUINCE
		I'm going to put a stop to this!

			     DREW
		Quince, you can't unscramble
		scrambled eggs.

			     QUINCE
		But I didn't mean to do it!

			     DREW
		The train's left the station, pal,
		and you're aboard.  Would you like
		to hear the silver lining?  Check
		that, gold.  I've been working with
		John Bontecou all along.  We had
		a game plan -- acquire Parrish
		Communications then break it apart
		and peddle it piece-by-piece to the
		highest bidder.  I set it up for
		him, he smacks it out of the park.

	Quince is struck dumb.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		Don't you know what this'll mean?
		You'll be rich.  You'll sell your
		stock, you can stop kissing ass --
		What'll it feel like to be a man?

			     QUINCE
		I don't want to get rich this way --
		I'm going to expose you.

			     DREW
		Go right ahead.  Tell William
		Parrish how you betrayed him at
		a secret Board meeting.  And tell
		Allison how you got her father
		fired -- and he lost his company.

	Quince goes ashen.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		It's just life, Quin-cee.

	Drew hails an employee across the hall.

			     DREW (cont'd)
			(to Quince)
		Wake up and smell the thorns.

	Drew joins the employee as Quince slumps against the wall.

	INT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

	Parrish enters, Joe right behind him, Coyle takes their coats,
	disappears.  Parrish hesitates for a moment, shrugs as if he
	has a thought he doesn't want to share, then heads upstairs
	with Joe.  He is trudging a bit, Joe senses his mood.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry, Bill --

			     PARRISH
		That's okay.

			     JOE
		What's okay?

			     PARRISH
		Just a manner of speaking.

	Joe seems puzzled.

			     PARRISH
			(cont'd)
		What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's
		over.  We've got bigger fish to fry,
		don't we, Joe?

			     JOE
		'Fish'?

			     PARRISH
		Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going
		to take a nap.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  Coyle will have
		Luisa fix you something to eat.

			     JOE
		I'm not hungry.

			     PARRISH
		Then I can't help you.

	Parrish turns into his bedroom, closing the door gently
	behind him.  Joe continues down the hall, enters the guest
	wing.

	INT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

	Midday sunlight streams into the sitting room, Joe passes
	through to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels
	the edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises
	again, crosses back to the sitting room.

	Susan appears in the doorway, Joe suddenly senses her, turns
	around.

			     SUSAN
		You're here?

			     JOE
		I am.

	He stands, they regard each other for the moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		May I take your coat?

	She doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, Joe
	comes around her to help, Susan senses him breathing in the
	scent at the back of her neck.

			     SUSAN
		I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge
		a little lunch, I was in the neigh-
		borhood --

			     JOE
		How beautiful.

	He starts to hang Susan's coat up.

			     SUSAN
		Just throw it on the chair.

	Joe holds her coat carefully on the chair.  An awkward
	moment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		When I called, they said that you
		and Daddy had just left the office.

			     JOE
		He's taking a nap.

			     SUSAN
		He must be tired -- this Bontecou
		thing --

			     JOE
		Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.

	A moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		You must be hungry?

	Susan sits on the couch.

			     SUSAN
		No, not anymore.  Are you?

	Joe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the
	couch beside her.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		(after a moment)
		Are you cold?

			     JOE
		...No.

			     SUSAN
		Maybe it's the draft through the
		door.

	She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to
	Joe.  A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each
	other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes
	as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but
	has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are
	instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin-
	gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This
	excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
	very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other
	are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know-
	ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions
	are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it
	before.

	Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert-
	ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak-
	ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
	Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land
	of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet
	at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being
	lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but
	is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing
	is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on.
	The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in
	the end there is the knowledge they have together made a
	journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events
	they have created; and they don't care about the consequences.

	Spent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:

			     SUSAN
		It's so wonderful to make love to
		you.  It's like making love to some-
		one who has never made love before.

	Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has
	said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself.
	He weighs, then resists, the impulse.

			     JOE
		Thank you.

	Her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his
	comforting her without knowing that he is doing so.

			     SUSAN
		Did you like making love to me?

			     JOE
		I loved it.

			     SUSAN
		More than you love peanut butter?

			     JOE
		Yes!

	She laughs at the earnestness with which he answers.

	Joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for
	the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone
	to some distant, distant land.

			     SUSAN
		Where are you going?

			     JOE
		Nowhere?  I'm...here.

			     SUSAN
		For how long?

			     JOE
		Oh, I hope a long, long time.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		Me, too.

	Another moment.

			     JOE
		What do we do now?

	She smiles.

			     SUSAN
		It will come to us.

	INT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE (LATER) - DAY

	Joe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her
	on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss.  The kiss
	lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back
	longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door
	softly after her.

	He turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the
	balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan.

			     JOE
		Hello, Bill.

	Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Did you have a nice nap?

			     PARRISH
		I couldn't sleep.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry to hear that.

	He starts up the stairs.

			     PARRISH
		No, I'll come down

	Joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as Parrish
	descends.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		What's going on?

	Joe senses Parrish's tone, doesn't answer.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I saw you kiss Susan.

			     JOE
		Yes, I saw you see me.

			     PARRISH
		Well, you're at the wrong place at
		the wrong time with the wrong woman.

			     JOE
		I'll be the judge of that.

			     PARRISH
		I'm her father!

			     JOE
		With all due respect, Bill, I'm not
		asking your permission.

			     PARRISH
		Well, you goddam well should.  You
		walk into my life, give me the worst
		news a guy can get, have me dancing
		on the heads of pins with my busi-
		ness and with my family, and now
		you're spooning with my daughter.

			     JOE
		'Spooning'?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, and stop repeating everything I
		sai, and turning it into a question.
		Spooning, fooling around, God knows
		what.  You arrive on the scene -- why
		you picked me, I still don't under-
		stand --

			     JOE
		I picked you for your verve, your
		excellence, and for your ability to
		- how shall I say - instruct.  You've
		lived a first-rate life.  And I find
		it eminently usable.

	Parrish measures Joe.

			     PARRISH
		What do you want?

	Joe doesn't answer, riveted now on Parrish.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Everybody wants something, Joe.
		You've been taking me from pillar
		to post here.  I thought I knew who
		you were, and it wasn't a whole lot
		of fun, however it was almost bear-
		able.  Now I'm getting something
		else from you, something very, very
		strange -- what is it that you want,
		Joe?

			     JOE
		I'm only following the Parrish
		bywords.  Looking for that 'ounce
		of excitement', that 'whisper of a
		thrill' -- What there is no sense
		living your life without.  You know
		what I mean, Bill.

	Parrish's jaw sets.

			     PARRISH
		You're violating the laws of the
		universe.

			     JOE
		This universe?

			     PARRISH
		Any universe that exists or ever
		existed.  You may be the pro, Joe.
		But I know who you are.  And you're
		all fucked up.

			     JOE
		I don't like your tone, and I don't
		like your references.

			     PARRISH
		And I don't give a shit.

			     JOE
		May I remind you this is not just a
		dispute with a putative suitor, this
		is me.  So watch it...Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you
		sonofabitch.

			     JOE
		I told you, 'watch it'.

	Silence.  Now Joe turns on his heel, heads right out the
	front door.  Parrish is left solitary, confounded, staring
	at the closed door.

	INT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

	Joe walks down a hallway, a bouquet of flowers in hand,
	looks around the usual feverish activity, he seems lost for
	the moment, but a Receptionist catches his eye.

			     RECEPTIONIST
		Can I help you?

			     JOE
		Dr. Parrish.

			     RECEPTIONIST
		She comes on at 6.

			     JOE
		Oh.

	He looks at the flowers, regards them for a moment, then
	heads for an elevator.

	INT. EASTER'S ROOM, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

	Easter is sitting up in bed, hooked up to an TV and moni-
	tors.  She glances over at the doorway, Joe is standing
	there, observing her.  An awkward silence, he looks at
	his flowers again, now sets them respectfully on Easter's
	bedstand.

			     EASTER
		Mistah Bad News.  'Bout time you
		show up.

	Joe speaks to her in the dialect.

			     JOE
		Don' be facety, woman.

			     EASTER
		None facety, mistah.  You come for
		me?  Dat's good news.

			     JOE
		No, I come to see Doctor.

			     EASTER
		Doctor?  What could be wrong wit'
		you?

			     JOE
		Nuthin'.

	Silence, then Easter smiles.

			     EASTER
		Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     EASTER
		My Doctor Lady?

			     JOE
		Mine, too.

	She thinks about this for the moment, Joe grows uncomfort-
	able.

			     EASTER
		You in love?

	Joe seems slightly tormented by the question, Easter senses
	him trying to frame a respect.

			     JOE
		Yah.

			     EASTER
		You loved back?

			     JOE
			I am.

			     EASTER
		She knows you real self?

			     JOE
		She knows how she feel.

			     EASTER
			(scoffing)
		Rass!

			     JOE
			(irritably)
		Don' need you okayin'.

			     EASTER
		Schoolboy tings is you head.
		Badness for you, badness for her,
		badness for me, lyin' here tumor,
		big as breadfruit, poison my inners
		an' waiting.

			     JOE
		Brung you flowers and all I gettin's
		facety back.

			     EASTER
			(stubbornly)
		Only flowers I wan' see's one's
		over my peaceful self restin' in
		the dutty.

			     JOE
		Can do no right by people.  Come to
		take, you wan' to stay, leave you
		stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!

	Silence, Easter waits, watching Joe.

			     EASTER
		You not in you right place, mistah.

	Easter's response stops Joe cold, he looks away and then
	back at her, she had clearly reached him.

			     EASTER (cont'd)
		I ain' either.  No more.  You come
		wi' me now.  Take me.

			     JOE
		But I not lonely here.  Somebody
		want me here.

	Easter considers Joe, she smiles sympathetically.

			     EASTER
		It nice it happen to you.  It like
		you came to Cat Island and you had
		a holiday, sun didn't burn you red,
		just brown, sleep no mosquito eat
		you, rum no poung you head nex' day.
		But trut' is, dat bound to happen,
		you stay long enough.  So tak dat
		nice picture home wi' you, but don'
		be fooled.  We lonely here mostly,
		too.  If we lucky, we got some nice
		pictures.

	Easter drifts into silence, her eyes and Joe's meet, a sense
	they understand each other.  Easter shifts, trying hard to
	ease her discomfort.

			     JOE
			(gently)
		Got enough nice pictured, Easter.

	She looks at him and nods gratefully and closes her eyes.
	Joe watches her, now his eyes close.  Easter exhales
	raspingly, falls still.  The monitors flatline.  A beeping
	alarm sound somewhere down the hall.

	Joe opens his eyes, takes a deep breath, he seems troubled.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		G'bye, sistah.

	She slips out of the room.

	INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Parrish is playing solitaire.  The SOUND of the front door
	closing, HEELS crossing the foyer, he looks up, at the foyer
	door is Susan.

			     PARRISH
		Hello, honey.

	He starts to get up, she motions to him to stay, looks
	around now.

			     SUSAN
		Where's Joe?

			     PARRISH
		Joe?

	A silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Joe's not around.

			     SUSAN
		Where is he?

			     PARRISH
		I don't know.

	Susan seems distracted.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Why are you looking for Joe?

			     SUSAN
		Because I was sitting in a staff
		meeting, incredibly bored, my mind
		kept wandering and the only place it
		landed was -- Joe.

			     PARRISH
		I don't understand.

			     SUSAN
		Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all
		those things you told me to wait
		for.  Well, they've arrived.

	Parrish blinks, stares down at his cards.

			     PARRISH
		This is crazy --

			     SUSAN
		Why?  A man appears at your side,
		almost never leaves it, you clearly
		trust him, depend on him, I sense
		you value him deeply, why aren't
		those things good enough for me?

			     PARRISH
		You don't know anything about Joe --

			     SUSAN
		What are you afraid of, Dad?  That
		I'll fall head over heels for Joe --
		well, I have -- as you did with Mom.
			(a moment)
		That's always been standard,
		whether you like or not.

	Parrish tries to get hold of himself, changes gear now.

			     PARRISH
		Susan, I don't think Joe is going to
		be with us long.

			     SUSAN
		Where's he going?

			     PARRISH
		I don't know, I can't say --

			     SUSAN
		C'mon!  The guy's working with you.
		You always know chapter and verse
		about everyone who works --

			     PARRISH
		In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I
		just can't help you.  I only would
		tell you -- that with Joe, you are
		on very, very dangerous ground.

	Susan doesn't answer for a moment.

			     SUSAN
		I love him.

			     PARRISH
		I don't care if you love him!  I'm
		telling you he's no good for you!

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		Of course not, Daddy.  I'm sorry.

	There is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a
	word has sunk in.  Parrish slumps.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I love you, too.

	She kisses Parrish, rearranges one of his ranks of cards,
	shuffles through the deck, turns over the top card, lays
	down a card Parrish needs.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Lightning does strike.

	Parrish watches as Susan turns, disappears out the door.

	EXT. THIRD AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - TWILIGHT

	Joe walking disconcertedly up the street, bumping shoulders
	with the rush hour crowd, trapped in the life of the city,
	he peers intently at faces, cars, into store windows.  He
	stops now at the window of a Korean grocery, something has
	caught his eye, he steps inside.

	Through the window, Joe can be seen making a purchase, he
	hands the Korean Clerk some money, walks out.

	Joe, back on the street now, unscrews the top of a jar of
	peanut butter, dips a wad out with his fingers.  The Korean
	Clerk runs out after him.

			     CLERK
		Change!  Change!

	Joe stops, uncomprehending.  The Clerk hands Joe bills and
	coins.

			     JOE
		Why are you giving me money?

			     CLERK
		Change.

			     JOE
		I am who I am.  I cannot change.

	Joe tries to hand the money back, but the baffled Clerk
	refuses it.

			     CLERK
		You change!

			     JOE
		That's impossible.  You're wasting
		your money.  I couldn't change even
		if I wanted to.

	The Clerk, exasperated, murmurs something in his language
	and returns to the store.  Joe continues on down the street.

	INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Parrish is sitting in a wing chair staring at the fire.  Joe
	appears in the doorway, Parrish doesn't notice him.  Joe
	waits, finally Parrish looks up.  They regard each other.
	Silence.

			     JOE
		Uh --

			     PARRISH
		Yes?

			     JOE
		-- I have the feeling that, all in
		all, what I made this voyage for --
		has served its purpose.

			     PARRISH
		What are you saying, that it's time
		to go?

	Joe doesn't respond, Parrish and Joe measure each other for
	the moment.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I'm ready.

			     JOE
		You are?

			     PARRISH
		Yeah.

			     JOE
		Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.

	Parrish nods, Joe nods back.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HELICOPTER POV, HUDSON VALLEY - AFTERNOON

	A bird's eye view of the Hudson, over the George Washington
	Bridge, past the widest expanse of the river at the Tappan
	Zee, coming in now over the great lawns and old estates of
	the Upper Hudson Valley, down towards Annadale-on-Hudson
	and the Parrish country estate, which commands a beehive of
	activity, tents and workmen and vehicles.

	EXT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

	The Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area.
	The Butler runs towards it to open the door, Parrish and
	Joe disembark.  Following the Butler, they make their way
	through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for
	music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists
	leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.  Parrish
	and Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking
	to one another.  Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder,
	there is a distance between them.  They walk on past chan-
	deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven
	through their branches.  Adding to the confusion, the AStar
	lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling
	from the blast of the rotors.  May, the housekeeper, appears.

			     MAY
			(to Parrish)
		Telephone call, sir.  Mr. Sloane
		from New York.

	Parrish nods, starts up for a wing off the main house, Joe
	right at his side.  Parrish stops.

			     PARRISH
		Excuse me.

	Joe, not knowing whether to be affronted or not, hesitates,
	and Parrish strides away.  Joe does not follow.

	INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

	A low-slung but well-appointed room with a writing table, a
	working fireplace, expensive and appropriate Hudson Valley
	prints.

	Parrish enters, clicks on the SPEAKERPHONE, observes the
	party activity through a wide, bow window.

			     PARRISH
		Eddie?

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?

			     PARRISH
		Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why
		are you still down here?

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		The Board's working through the
		weekend, trying up the loose ends
		this damn thing.  But I want to give
		it one more try, I'm still holding
		out some hope.

			     PARRISH
		Eddie, hold out all the hope you
		want but, I promise you, it's hope-
		less, it's over.  Come on up, let's
		get drunk, if I had your shoulder
		to lean on I might actually enjoy
		this --

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		No, I'm going to stay down here,
		keep my finger in the dike and maybe
		by Monday, the waters could recede.

			     PARRISH
		If you're trying to show me lay-
		down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty,
		forget it.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your
		cake, blow out the candles and make
		a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?

			     PARRISH
		Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for
		the memory.

	Parrish clicks off the SPEAKERPHONE, turns around and looks
	out the window again, the party preparations in full swing,
	colored lights are tested, they flicker on and off.

	EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

	Allison is everywhere, Parrish emerges from his wing, she
	catches his eye immediately, the calm director of a DeMille-
	like epic, politely giving workers instructions, making
	lightning decisions.

	Parrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain
	encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux-
	Cyrillic, a 'B' and a 'P', as rubber-booted delivery men
	carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each
	letter.  A smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected
	lull, Allison backs into him at the fountain.

			     ALLISON
		Hi, Daddy, what do you think?

			     PARRISH
		It's starting to grow on me.  But
		what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?

			     ALLISON
		The fountain is the Caspian Sea and
		the Sea is serving up caviar.  The
		'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for
		Petrossian.  Of course, they also
		stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.

			     PARRISH
		Do they, m'dear?

			     ALLISON
		-- Plus we've got a baritone with a
		balalaika coming from The Russian
		Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a
		Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson
		Eddy songs.

	Parrish shakes his head.

			     PARRISH
		You are amazing.  Why, oh why,
		Allison, are you doing all this?

	But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's
	sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions
	out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away
	now, daughter and father, alone.

			     ALLISON
		I do it because I love you.  Because
		everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher-
		ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the
		people who work for you, everybody
		who's ever known you.

			     PARRISH
		Yeah?  And what about my enemies?

			     ALLISON
		They respect you.  Isn't that a kind
		of love?

	Unexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's
	forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he
	blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		Above all, you've been a wonderful
		father.

			     PARRISH
		I haven't been the father to you
		that --

			     ALLISON
		That you've been to Susan?

			     PARRISH
		I wasn't going to say --

			     ALLISON
		But that's what you were thinking.
		And that's okay.  Because I know you
		love me.  Not like it is with Susan,
		the way your eyes light up when she
		comes in the room and the way she
		always gets a laugh out of you, as
		opposed to me when I walk in a room
		and that look comes over your face,
		"What does she want now?"

	A weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th
	Infantry Regiment  "C" (Charlie) Company.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		I already feel I've had everything I
		could have wanted for my birthday --

			     PARRISH
		Hey, there's lots to come.
			(gesturing to me
			 activity)
		A little excess -- like you love.

	The preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate
	plans coming to fruition.

			     PARRISH
		You know, darling, this is going to
		be a wonderful party.

			     ALLISON
			(gently)
		Yes, it is.

	Allison wades into the maelstrom now, Parrish watches her
	go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her.

	EXT. WINE BAR, LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

	Ambrose, the head caterer, is making a last minute check
	of the bar's stock, Quince ambles up, in the background the
	activity has built to a pitch, waiters adjusting their uni-
	forms, purveyors' trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust.

			     QUINCE
		Give me a Seagrams and '7'.

	Ambrose looks at him blankly.

			     QUICNCE (cont'd)
		No got?  Okay a double V.O., water
		back.

			     AMBROSE
		I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr.
		Quince.

			     QUINCE
		Okay, give me a bottle of wine.

			     AMBROSE
		Red or white?

			     QUINCE
		Both.

	Joe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting
	up last-minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his
	traps past on a little cart.  Joe doesn't seem to know where
	he is, when his eyes alight on Quince, he heads for this
	oasis.  Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
			(to Joe)
		Red or white?

			     JOE
		No, thank you.

	Quince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of
	each into one glass.

			     QUINCE
		C'mon, have a drink.  You look like
		you need one bad as me.

			     JOE
		Do I?  I'm a little confused.

			     QUINCE
		Confused, huh?  About what?

			     JOE
		Love.

			     QUINCE
		'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles
		of my own.

			     JOE
		You love Allison, don't you?

			     QUINCE
		Oh yes, I do.

			     JOE
		How did you meet?

			     QUINCE
		I was a world-class loser and she
		was a happy, little rich girl --
		and for some reason she took me in.

			     JOE
		But she loves you?

	Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		How do you know?

			     QUINCE
		Because there's nothing we don't
		know about each other and it's okay.
		I mean the deeper, darkest secrets
		-- they don't matter.

			     JOE
		'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?

			     QUINCE
		Yeah, it's like you know every inch
		of each other's souls -- and then
		you're free.

			     JOE
		What do you mean 'free'?

			     QUINCE
		Free to love each other.  Com-
		pletely.  Totally.  No fear.

	Quince seems uncharacteristically within himself.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
		All that hoopla up there reminds me
		how I will never measure up to a man
		like Bill Parrish - or his daughter.

	He drains his wine.

			     QUINCE (cont'd)
		Do you like me, Joe?

			     JOE
		Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.

			     QUINCE
		What would you say if you knew
		it was me who brought down Bill
		Parrish?
			(a moment)
		I told Drew and the Board that Bill
		depended on you.  Drew led me on,
		but I had no business telling him
		in the first place.  He was setting
		up Bill from day one.  Drew and
		Bontecou are going to chop up the
		company and sell it off for parts.
		Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr.
		Inside.  And I was the fool who made
		it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?

	Joe regards Quince.

			     JOE
		Go to Bill Parrish and tell him
		everything.  He'll forgive you.

	Quince drains one more glass of wine.

			     QUINCE
		You think so?  How do you know?

			     JOE
		Because that's the kind of man Bill
		Parrish is.

	A moment.

			     QUINCE
		Well, maybe... I guess you know him
		better than anybody.

	Another moment.

			     JOE
		-- Getting to.

	The orchestra behind them plays a few riffs, sound checks,
	getting close.

			     QUINCE
		Do you think I should wait to tell
		him 'till after the party?

			     JOE
		No.

	Quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully.  They look on
	as the pre-party activities swirl on around them.

	EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET (LATER)

	The moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes,
	a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house,
	being directed into adjacent fields.  Susan cuts past a re-
	ceiving line that files up the stairs, she skirts the house
	and heads straight for the action, the party on the lawns in
	the rear, climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the
	event on which the curtain is just about to rise.

	EXT. LAWN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

	Guests milling, emerging from the crowd Susan sees, isolated
	by a fountain, Joe.  He looks up towards her, he knows she
	has seen him, they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been
	prearranged but which they intuit.  Susan slants through the
	guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha-
	tter float on the wind, "He, Susie!",  "What a party",  "You
	look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.

	Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful,
	unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is
	not certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.

	EXT. GARDEN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

	The very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse
	of river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the
	garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in
	front of them.

			     SUSAN
		I like you in a black tie.

			     JOE
		I love you in an evening gown.

			     SUSAN
		It beats a surgical, doesn't it?

	He smiles.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Daddy told me you might be leaving?

			     JOE
		Yes.  Your father and I, our time
		together has come to an end.

			     SUSAN
		Where are you going?

	Joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		You won't tell me?

			     JOE
		Well -- I --

			     SUSAN
		And you can't tell me who you are.

	Again the same indescribable gesture from Joe.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I'm in love with a man, I don't know
		who he is, where he's going or when.

			     JOE
		I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.

			     SUSAN
		It gets worse.

			     JOE
		No worse than it gets for me.  I'm
		in love with a woman whom I don't
		want to leave.

			     SUSAN
		Then don't.

	A moment.

			     JOE
		We know so little about each
		other --

			     SUSAN
		We know all that we need to know --

			     JOE
		But there's so much to tell you --

			     SUSAN
		Don't.  That will come later.

			     JOE
		Will it?

			     SUSAN
		Lightning struck.  We caught it in
		a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want
		to be with you, Joe --

	Another moment.

			     JOE
		What will we do?

			     SUSAN
		'Love will find out the way'.

			     JOE
		'Love will find out the way'?

			     SUSAN
		It's a saying.

			     JOE
		I believe that, don't you?

			     SUSAN
		Yes, that's why I said it.

	They are on the brink of some decision, Joe is about to make
	some declaration when Allison is heard --

			     ALLISON (O.S.)
		There you are!

	Allison appears.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		What's going on here?  Tete-a-tetes
		on my big night?
			(to Susan)
		C'mon honey, you're needed.
			(to Joe)
		Can it wait?

	But before he can answer --

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		Glad to hear it!
			(to Susan)
		Let's go.

	She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall,
	watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up'
	dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all.  The
	curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.

	INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	Quince is "on the carpet", sweating through a confession,
	Parrish moroses but  philosophical at his desk.

			     QUINCE
		...what can I say after I say that
		I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've
		zagged, I opened my big mouth one
		too many times, everything got all
		twisted --

			     PARRISH
		It's okay, Quince.  I understand.
		You've always meant well and I
		appreciate that.  Sometimes things
		just turn out -- wrong.

	A KNOCK on the door, it opens, Joe appears.

			     JOE
		Excuse me --

	He starts to step out.

			     QUINCE
		Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you
		-- okay, Bill?

			     PARRISH
		Sure.

	As Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him.

			     QUINCE
			(to Parrish)
		Joe knew the whole story.  I told
		him.  It was his idea that I come
		clean.  I mean I wanted to come
		clean but he gave me a pair of
		balls, you know what I mean?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, I believe I do.

	Quince now drifts off.

			QUICHE
		Yeah, well -- I can tell you guys
		got business --

			     PARRISH
		No, I'm out of business, right,
		Quince?  However I do have some
		unfinished business -- with Drew.
		Get him out here.  Get him on the
		chopper and get him out here to-
		night.  I want to tell this guy
		how I feel about him face-to-face.

			     QUINCE
		Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P.
		I doubt that Drew's anxious to see
		you face-to-face.

	Joe steps in.

			     JOE
			(to Quince)
		Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges
		that this was a contest and he's
		lost.  The race is to the swift,
		but could Drew summon a modicum
		of understanding and allow Bill to
		save face.  Tell him Bill wants it
		understood in the business community
		he has merely moved upstairs in his
		own company, and the executive
		continuity is unbroken.  Tonight's
		the night to do it.  He'll introduce
		Drew to his press friends as well as
		some of his close acquaintances from
		Washington and Drew can tell them
		that everything's sailing along just
		fine.

	Parrish is impressed by Joe's acumen, a look of grudging
	admiration.  He nods to Joe, summarizes:

			     PARRISH
			(to Quince)
		All in all, what Bill wants to do is
		build the golden bridge to Drew with
		no hard feelings.

			     QUINCE
		You think Drew will go for it?

			     PARRISH
		Quince, I've got confidence in you.

			     QUINCE
		Sir, I'll deliver the package.

	He heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent.

			     PARRISH
		Thanks.

			     JOE
		Not at all.

	A moment.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		How are you doing?

			     PARRISH
		What the hell do you care?

			     JOE
		I was just asking, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		You 'want to know', I'll tell you.
		You're looking at a man who tonight
		is not about to walk through the
		Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's
		galloping into it.  And the same time,
		the business he built with his own
		hands and his own head is being
		commandeered by a couple of cheap
		pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost
		forgot, my daughter's fallen in
		love with Death.

	Another moment.

			     JOE
		-- And I'm in love with your
		daughter.

			     PARRISH
		Say again?

			     JOE
		I'm in love with your daughter, and
		I'm taking her with me tonight.

	Parrish is stunned.

			     PARRISH
		You're what?

			     JOE
		I think you heard me, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		You're not taking Susan anywhere.
		And what the hell does that mean
		anyway?

	Joe doesn't answer for a moment.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I thought we had a deal.

			     JOE
		I'm sorry, Bill --

			     PARRISH
		Susan is my daughter, she has a
		wonderful life ahead of her and
		you're going to deprive her of
		it and you're telling me you're
		sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology
		not accepted.

			     JOE
		I love her, Bill.  She is all that
		I ever wanted, and I've never wanted
		for anything because I've never
		wanted anything before, if you can
		understand.

			     PARRISH
		How perfect for you -- to take
		whatever you want because it
		pleases you.  It's not love --

			     JOE
		Then what is it?

			     PARRISH
		Some aimless infatuation in which,
		for the moment, you feel like in-
		dulging.  It's missing everything
		that matters.

			     JOE
		Which is what?

			     PARRISH
		Trust, responsibility, taking the
		weight, for your choices and feel-
		ings and spending the rest of your
		life living up to them.  And above
		all, not hurting the object of your
		love.

			     JOE
		So that's what love is?

			     PARRISH
		Multiply it by infinity and take it
		to the death of forever and you will
		still have barely a glimpse of what
		I am talking about.

			     JOE
		Those were my words, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Well, they're mine now.

	Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.

			     JOE
		Susan wants to come.  She says she's
		in love with me.

			     PARRISH
		With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you
		tell her who you are?

			     JOE
		No.

			     PARRISH
		Does she know where she's going?

	Joe doesn't answer.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Susan went, in whatever way she did,
		for that poor sonofabitch whose body
		you took, and everything else since
		has been aftermath.  You say you love
		her but you don't know what love is.
		She 'loves' you but she doesn't know
		who you are.  You make a deal, you're
		breaking it -- the bottom line is,
		Joe, you're conducting a Great
		Romance under false pretenses.

			     JOE
		I don't like what you're saying.

			     PARRISH
		I don't expect you to.

			     JOE
		Are you threatening me?

			     PARRISH
		I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan
		from the moment she was born, and I
		love her now, and every minute in
		between, and what I dream of is a
		man who will discover her and she
		will discover a man who will love
		her, who is worthy of her, who is of
		this world, of this time and has the
		grace and compassion and fortitude
		to walk beside her as she makes her
		way through this beautiful thing
		called life.

	Parrish is beginning to reach Joe.

			     JOE
		Are you telling me I can't be
		part of it?

	A pause, Parrish's posture changes.

			     PARRISH
		Why did you come in here and tell
		me, Joe?  You are the Biggest Shot
		of all, you don't have to ask my
		permission, but that's what you're
		doing.  You know why?  Because you've
		somewhere, somehow, developed into a
		good guy, and you know this is all
		wrong... I don't know what you're
		going to do -- how can this be love?
		She doesn't know who you are.  Why
		don't you tell her?  Try it out on
		her?  See what happens.  Reveal
		everything there is to know about
		yourself and let the chips fall
		where they may.

	Joe has received what Parrish has said.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Okay? -- I've given it my best shot.
		I wish I could tell you to sleep on
		it but...

	Parrish lets his words drift into silence, he shrugs, Joe
	regards him.

	EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a
	weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself
	until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the
	party.  He drifts into the center and runs right into Susan,
	couples swirl about them, the eye of a storm of gaiety.

			     SUSAN
		Hello, Joe.  What'd you know?

	She smiles.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		There's something so indescribably
		sexy about you in a crowd.  I could
		make love to you right here.

	He hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		If you're going to tell my future,
		you're on the wrong side.

	A moment.

			     JOE
		There is something I do want to tell
		you --

	He stammers into silence.

			     SUSAN
		But you can't.

	Joe is about to respond but doesn't.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Just then -- when you hesitated --
		the way you shift from foot-to-foot,
		I've always found endearing but just
		now -- I got a chill.

	But he drifts again, now she takes his hand.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Remember that morning in the coffee
		shop?  You said 'What's wrong with
		taking care of a woman, she takes
		care of you --"

			     JOE
		Did I say that?

			     SUSAN
		And I said you'd have a hard time
		finding a woman like that.

	Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Well, you've found one, Joe.

			     JOE
		The 'coffee shop' --

			     SUSAN
		-- That was the place... and you were
		the guy.

	Joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		And you said you didn't want me to
		be your doctor because you didn't
		want me to examine you --?
			(a moment)
		Well, I got to examine you after
		all --

	Joe blinks, at a loss.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		I could come with you --

			     JOE
		I - uh --

			     SUSAN
		You want me to wait for you, you'll
		be back --

	Joe doesn't answer, Susan is suddenly anxious.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		Why do I want this night to last
		forever?

			     JOE
		Don't you know, that's what I want
		more than anything.

	He touches her face.

			     SUSAN
		You said before you couldn't tell me
		who or where, only the 'when' -- Is
		when now?

	A moment.

			     JOE
		May I kiss you?

	She waits.  He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.

			     SUSAN
		That felt like a goodbye.

	Joe's silence is heavy.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		What's going on, Joe?  I feel like
		we're lifting off --

			     JOE
		I'm still here.

			     SUSAN
		But you're not.  You're somewhere
		else.
			(a moment)
		You're someone else --

	Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he
	drifts into a long silence.  Susan is beside herself, her
	emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her.

			     SUSAN
		Tell me you love me -- tell me
		you love me now --

			     JOE
		I love you now, I'll love you
		always --

			     SUSAN
		Hold me --

	He holds on tight to her.  They are desperately entwined
	until finally she releases him.

			     JOE
		Susan --

			     SUSAN
		-- Yes?

			     JOE
		Thank you for loving me.

	She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her.

	INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party
	flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted,
	the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself.

	Joe enters, Parrish looks up.

			     JOE
		...We should think about getting
		started, Bill.

	Parrish waits.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		It'll just be us.

	The tension in Parrish's body releases, he takes a breath.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you.

	Joe nods an acknowledgement, but his face reflects his pain.
	Parrish regards him sympathetically.

	The silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door.  Parrish, out
	of politeness to Joe, does not respond.

			     QUINCE (O.S.)
		Bill --?

	After a moment.

			     PARRISH
		Come in.

	Quince appears, flushed with excitement.

			     QUINCE
		-- I got him.  The chopper's two
		minutes away.

	Parrish weighs the information for a moment.

			     PARRISH
			(to Joe)
		How are we on time?

	Joe shrugs, nods gently.

			     JOE
		Okay.

			     PARRISH
			(to Quince)
		Get him in here.

	Quince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker-
	phone.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		...May? -- I know you're busy,  but I
		want you to put in a call to Eddie
		Sloane for me --

			     MAY (O.S.)
		At home, sir --?

			     PARRISH
		No, he's at the office.

	EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	An area on the fringe of the party, the helicopter blades
	stop spinning.  Quince hurries to the aircraft door, opens
	it and Drew steps out.  Quince leads the way through the
	lights and MUSIC.  Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for
	himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the
	irony.

			     DREW
		This is damn big of Bill, I also
		think it's smart.

			     QUINCE
		He had no choice.  You're a
		formidable adversary.

			     DREW
		He said that?

			     QUINCE
		Well, you've got him by the short-
		hairs.

			     DREW
		Yeah, the short, gray hairs.

	He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen
	acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study.

	INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	Parrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		We're all here, Bill --

			     PARRISH
		I appreciate this, Eddie, members
		of the Board, this will just take a
		minute of your time.  As the custo-
		dians of the company, you may re-
		ceive information from what follows
		that is valuable to you --
			(a moment)
		-- or not.  Either way, thanks.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
			(speakerphone)
		We're all ears.

	Drew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and
	closes the door behind him.

			     DREW
		Hi, Bill, happy birthday --

	A moment.

			     DREW (cont'd)
		I just wanted to say how appre-
		ciative I am of this - uh - grand
		gesture and --

			     PARRISH
		Shut up and sit down.

	Drew takes a seat.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		You're a worthless sack of shit, you
		fucked me over, played footsie with
		John Bontecou, sold my company out
		to line your own pockets.

			     DREW
		I don't know where you get that idea
		-- the Board agreed --

			     PARRISH
		The Board didn't know you're a mole
		who burrowed inside so you could bury
		us all.

			     DREW
		Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another
		one of his whoppers?  Aren't you
		sick of this asshole lurking around?
		No one knows who he is, but one
		thing everyone does know, he somehow
		got your ear and has been pouring
		poison into it ever since.

	Joe can no longer control himself.

			     JOE
		You're the poison, Drew.  You've
		operated behind-the-scenes to suborn
		the trust of a man who has stamped
		you with his imprimatur of class and
		elegance and stature.  I've seen all
		kinds and degrees of deception in my
		time, but Bill Parrish has been on
		the receiving end of machinations so
		Machiavellian that it has rarely
		been my experience to encounter.  And
		yet he has combatted them stoically,
		and selflessly, without revealing my
		identity.  Had he violated the vow
		of secrecy he took, his task would
		have been far easier, he could have
		turned defeat into victory, but he
		is too honorable a man to have done
		that.  And now I must release him
		from that vow.  Because of me, he
		has lost his work, his company, his
		reputation -- and now he's going to
		tell you who I am.

	Parrish is struck dumb.  He looks at Joe pleadingly, shaking
	his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- and
	then commandingly.

			     DREW
			(to Parrish)
		So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in
		my pants.

			     JOE
		-- And now you're going to pee some
		more.

			     PARRISH
		Joe, don't do this --

			     JOE
		It's time to put this person where
		he belongs.

			     PARRISH
		It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's
		going to step aside --

			     DREW
		I'm not stepping anywhere --

			     JOE
		I appreciate your gentlemanliness,
		Bill, but what we need to do here is
		drive the dagger home --

			     DREW
		The dagger --?

			     PARRISH
		I told you to shut up.

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --

			     PARRISH
		He is --

			     JOE
		I'll take it from here --
			(to Drew)
		I am --

			     PARRISH
		-- An IRS man.

	Drew is stunned, Joe glances at Parrish, hesitates.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Yes, he is.  He's an -- IRS man.
		Aren't you, Joe?

	Joe is at a loss, Parrish's eyes are glued to his, Joe gets
	the hint.

			     JOE
		Yes, I am.
			(to Drew)
		IRS man.

	Drew's head swivels from Joe to Parrish and back again.

			     PARRISH
		The Treasury Department asked
		my cooperation in his undercover
		investigation of John Bontecou.
		They were convinced that Bontecou,
		on past deals, had structured his
		mergers and acquisitions in sus-
		picious and complicated ways so as
		to evade paying the taxes he is
		liable for.  The IRS wanted to go
		after him, and this deal offered
		them the opportunity.
			(a moment)
		I agreed to cooperate.

			     JOE
			(to Parrish)
		And we're very grateful.

			     PARRISH
		Moreover, Agent Joe Black here --
		of course that's not his real name
		-- smelled out your involvement,
		Drew.  He developed evidence you
		were working both sides of the
		fence.  Unfortunately, that's known
		as a conflict of interest --

			     JOE
		Undisclosed conflict of interest --

			     PARRISH
		An offense --

			     JOE
		An indictable offense.

	Silence.

			     DREW
		I think I'd like to talk to my
		lawyer --

			     PARRISH
		No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to
		offer you a deal.

	Drew is all attention.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Confess to the Board every details of
		your participation and then submit
		your resignation.

			     DREW
		And what do I get?

			     PARRISH
		You get not to go to jail.

			     DREW
		You're talking through your hat.
		You're offering a deal because
		you've got no proof.

			     PARRISH
		Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.

			     JOE
			(to Drew)
		And he's talking through his lips.

	Joe steps forward.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Make no mistake, Drew, if you choose
		to test my resolve in this matter,
		you'll be looking at an outcome that
		will have a finality that is beyond
		your comprehension, and you'll not
		be counting the days or the months
		or the years, but millenniums in the
		house with no doors.

	Drew slumps.

			     DREW
		All right, you win.  As soon as I
		get back to the city, I'll meet with
		the Board.

	Sloane's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
		You're meeting with the Board right
		now, Drew.  Resignation accepted.
		Moreover, I propose a motion to re-
		confirm William Parrish as Chairman
		of the Board of Parrish Communica-
		tions as well as a rejection of the
		merger with Bontecou International.
		How say you, Board?

	A chorus of thunderous "Yes"es resounds through the
	SPEAKERPHONE.

			     SLOANE (O.S., cont'd)
		The motion is passed.

			     PARRISH
		Well, thank you, that's great, but
		it's more than I bargained for.  I
		just wanted to set the record
		straight.

			     SLOANE (O.S.)
		But we want you back, Bill.  Mean-
		while, enjoy your party, celebrate,
		we'll attend to the nasty details.
		And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.

			     JOE
		My pleasure.  This is an IRS Agent's
		dream.  I'll be promoted to Chief of
		Section off of this.

	Parrish clicks the speakerphone off.  Drew is staring at
	Joe, shaking his head.

			     DREW
		Who would've ever believed it?  You,
		an IRS Agent --

	Silence.  Joe shrugs, smiles.

			     JOE
		'Death and Taxes'.

	The door flies open, an anxious Allison appears.

			     ALLISON
		Daddy!  We've been looking all over
		for you - this is your party - what
		are you doing in here?  Never mind.
		You're on.  Let's go.

	She pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room,
	Joe right behind them.

	EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

	The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the
	orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears
	with Allison.  An enormous cake is unveiled with one great,
	lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs.  He pauses over the
	cake, now blows the candle out.  APPLAUSE, cries of "Speech!
	Speech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes
	loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the
	crowd.  Joe observes from the fringe.

			     PARRISH
			(to the guests)
		I thought I was going to sneak away
		tonight...

	YELLS of "No!"  "Never!"

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		...What a glorious night, every
		face I see is a memory.  It may not
		be a perfectly perfect memory --
		sometimes we had our ups and downs
		-- but we're all together, and
		you're mine for a night.
			(a moment)
		-- And I'm going to break precedent,
		and tell you my one-candle wish --
		that you would have a life as lucky
		as mine, where you can wake up one
		morning and say "I don't want
		anything more."
			(another moment)
		Sixty-five years - don't they go by
		in a blink?

	Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows
	into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.  Quince
	grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.  Now
	Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they
	hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated
	by a surge of guests.  Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but
	there is a tinge of sadness about her.  He heads towards her,
	they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.

			     SUSAN
		What a night.

			     PARRISH
		I'm having a helluva time.

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		You were right about Joe, he is
		going somewhere --

			     PARRISH
			(gently)
		I'm sorry.

	Susan is examining Parrish very closely.

			     SUSAN
		Are you relieved?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, but --

	Parrish hesitates.

			     SUSAN
		But what?

			     PARRISH
		I want you to know how much I love
		you.  That you've given a meaning
		to my life that I had no right to
		expect, and that no one can ever
		take from me.

			     SUSAN
		Daddy --

			     PARRISH
		No -- I love you so much and I want
		you to promise me something.  I
		don't want you to ever worry about
		me.  If anything should happen, I'm
		going to be fine and everything's
		going to be all right.
			(a moment)
		-- And I have no regrets.

	Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		And I want you to feel that way,
		too.

			     SUSAN
		I love you, Daddy --

			     PARRISH
		That's why it's okay.

	They drift into silence.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		No regrets?

	After a moment.

			     SUSAN
		'No regrets'.

	A long silence, Susan smiles.

			     PARRISH
		It's a good feeling, isn't it?

	Silence again.

			     SUSAN
		Everybody's saying goodbye...

	They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an
	understanding.

			     PARRISH
		I'm still here.
			(a moment)
		Would you like to dance with me,
		Susan?

			     SUSAN
		Oh, yes --

	He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.

			     PARRISH
		If you don't mind dancing with an
		old fogey like me.

			     SUSAN
		Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll
		never be old.

	He takes her in his arms and they dance away.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still
	commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.  His eyes are on
	Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully.
	A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops.

			     WAITER
		Can I get you anything, sir?

	Joe regards the Waiter for a moment.

			     JOE
		Do you have any peanut butter?

	The Waiter hesitates.

			     WAITER
		I don't think so, sir.

			     JOE
		Thank you, anyway.

	The Waiter moves off.  Joe's attention returns to Parrish and
	Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	On the dance floor.

			     PARRISH
		What was that?

			     SUSAN
		The fireworks are about to start.

	Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
			(to Parrish)
		Shall we?

			     PARRISH
		You go ahead, honey, I'm going to
		catch my breath.

	Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.  She looks at
	him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she
	smiles back.  Now she heads out with the crowd for the
	fireworks.  When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns
	and heads up towards Joe.

	Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.

			     JOE
		Happy Birthday, Bill.

			     PARRISH
		Thank you.

	They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks.
	Joe's gaze lingers.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Did you say goodbye?

			     JOE
		Not exactly.

			     PARRISH
		I guess you have your reasons.

			     JOE
		Yes.

	Silence.

			     PARRISH
		Now that we have a moment, would you
		mind if I expressed my gratitude for
		what you did for Susan?

	Joe waits.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		I never heard her speak of any man
		as she spoke of you -- It was always
		what I wanted for her -- but what
		happens to her now?

			     JOE
		I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.
		These things have a way of working
		out.

	Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish
	has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues:

			     JOE (cont'd)
		And would you mind if I expressed my
		gratitude...?

	Parrish waits.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		For you.  For the time you've given
		me.  For the person you are.

	A moment.

			     PARRISH
		Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll
		ruin my autopsy.

	Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the
	crowd below, searching.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		It's hard to let go, isn't it?

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     PARRISH
		That's life.  What can I tell you?

	A silence, an understanding there is another more to say.
	Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we?",
	Parrish nods and Joe turns with him.  They set off now away
	from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
	the river.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial
	fireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest
	isn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over-
	powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a
	distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  Some-
	thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
	her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the
	fireworks.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.

			     PARRISH
		I'm getting a little dizzy, I can
		feel my heart pumping --

	But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on
	up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step
	with him.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Should I be afraid?

	Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.

			     JOE
		Not a man like you.

	Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides
	out again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue
	on and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage
	of fireworks lights up the sky.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks
	up towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates,
	now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she
	walks up towards the hill.

	Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from
	over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.
	He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,
	seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if
	pulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he
	keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.

			     SUSAN
		Joe...?

	He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right
	in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so
	appealing.  They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet
	close.

			     SUSAN (cont'd)
		You're here...

	He is trying to get his bearings.

			     JOE
		-- You bet.

	Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative.

			     SUSAN
		Where did you go?

	Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of
	time and place.

			     JOE
		I don't know -- y'know, I don't know
		-- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And
		would y'know what I mean if I said I
		don't think it's worth figuring out?

	Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her
	lightheaded.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		...But now I'm back.

	Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an
	answer.

			     SUSAN
			(gently)
		That's it?

			     JOE
		Well, I don't know what else to say.
		It's a helluva party --

			     SUSAN
		You think so?

			     JOE
		Yeah...and you're the prettier
		thing here.

	Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his
	jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she
	regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
	with the last moments fades away.

	Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken,
	a sudden intake of breath.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Hey, you all right?

	His hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her
	support.

			     SUSAN
		The coffee shop --

	The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.

			     YOUNG MAN
		I asked you if I said something
		wrong and you said it was so right
		it scared you.

	Susan holds herself very still.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		And forgive me for saying this --
		but then you said -- and it's been
		with me ever since --

			     SUSAN
		What has --?

	He hesitates.

			     YOUNG MAN
		You said you liked me.

			     SUSAN
		No --

			     YOUNG MAN
		Y'didn't?

	A moment.

			     SUSAN
		I said I liked you so much.

	She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments'
	revelations.  The Young Man senses her discomfort which
	is on the edge of pain.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Hey, everything's going great --
		don't y'think?

	She doesn't answer for a moment.

			     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
		Don't you feel that way?

			     SUSAN
		...We know so little about each
		other.

			     YOUNG MAN
		But we've got time.

	She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open,
	completely vulnerable, waiting for her response.  A long
	silence, the words come out haltingly:

			     SUSAN
		I wish you could've known my
		father...

	Another moment.

			     YOUNG MAN
		Me, too.

	Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are
	completely intent on each other.

			     SUSAN
		...What do we do now?

	A long silence.

			     YOUNG MAN
		It will come to us.

	Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes
	up from below, the night fills with light.  The Young Man
	searches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together
	they start back towards the party.

	THE END

                        GIL (V.O.)
              This is unbelievable - look at
              this. There's no city like this in
              the world. There never was.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              It's become so touristy.
                         GIL (V.O.)
              Well that's just the awful era we
              live in but can you just imagine
              what this was like before - but
              even with all the fast food joints
              and the traffic - god, you just
              can't imagine what it was like
              years ago.
                         INEZ (V.O.)
              Well you like cities.
                        GIL (V.O.)
              I really do - I love cities - I
              love big cities with all the crowds
              and all the action.
    (Having seen a panoramic view of let us say the Champs Elysee
    we embark on a montage of the city. The comments offered

              I don't get here often enough is
              the problem. Every once in a while
              for a few days is nothing - my
              biggest regret is that I didn't
              settle here the first time I came.
              I should have gone with my
              instincts.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              I admit it's pretty but so are so
              many other places I've visited.

              If I'd have stayed the first time I

                         GIL (V.O.)
              I'm thinking of a painting by
              Pisarro I've seen of Paris in the
              rain. Can you picture how drop
              dead gorgeous this city is in the
              rain? Imagine this town in the
              twenties - Paris in the twenties -
              in the rain - the artists and
              writers - I was born too late. Why
              did God deliver me into the world
              in the 1970's and in Pasadena yet.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              Why does every city have to be in
              the rain? What's wonderful about
              getting wet?

              It's romantic.

              Oh god, no. I could never live out

                        GIL (V.O.)

              Right, and becoming rich and

              There's nothing wrong with your
              father and I disagreeing. That's
              what democracy is. Your father
              defends the right wing of the
              Republican party and I happen to
              think they represent sub-mental

              with the opera to get some of the

              thought Puccini would be nice.

               if I'm not mistaken, in old French
               the word Versailles means something
               like "terrain where the weeds have
               been pulled". The main structure
               is French classical style at its

               This is, of course, Rodin's most
               famous statue. A cast of this work
               was placed next to his tomb. Rodin
               wished for it to serve as his
               headstone and epitaph.

              That would be in Meudon. He died
              of the flu if I'm not mistaken -
              1917 I believe.
                        GUIDE
              Exactly correct. You know your art
              history, monsieur. The design -

              The Thinker is so powerful because

                            PAUL
              So much of Rodin's work was
              influenced by his wife, Camille.
                        GUIDE
              Yes, she was an influence - though
              Camille was not the wife but his
              mistress.
                            PAUL
              Camille?      No.
                            GUIDE
              Yes.      Rose was the wife.
                            PAUL
              He never married Rose.
                        GUIDE
              Yes, in the last year of their
              lives.
                            PAUL
              I think you're mistaken.

                  I'm afraid she's right. I just
                  read the recent two volume
                  biography of Rodin - Rose was
                  definitely the wife, Camille the
                  mistress.
                            PAUL
                  You read that? Where did you read
                  that?

                  I did - no question.    Camille-

                         PAUL
               Slightly more tannic than the '59.
               I prefer a smoky feeling to a
               fruity feeling, don't you agree?

     Gil wanders. Eventually he is at a lovely spot. Perhaps by
     the river, the bridge - or somewhere else but he's just
     wandering lost. Finally he looks at his watch.
     Either by his watch or a nearby building clock, the hands
     move to exactly midnight. perhaps midnight chimes somewhere.

                  Actually I don't know the

                  Where they sell old things -
                  memorabilia. Does that sound
                  terrible to you?
                            HEMINGWAY
                  No subject is terrible if the story
                  is true. If the prose is clean and
                  honest and if it affirms courage
                  and grace under pressure.

                  Your novel?

                  It's only about four hundred pages -
                  if you could just give me your
                  opinion.
                            HEMINGWAY
                  My opinion is I hate it.
                            GIL
                  You do?
                            HEMINGWAY
                  If it's bad I'll hate it because I
                  hate bad writing and if it's good
                  I'll be envious and hate it all the
                  more. You don't want the opinion
                  of another writer.
                            GIL
                  But there's no one I really trust
                  to evaluate it -

                  Writers are competitive.

                  You're too self-effacing - it's not
                  manly. If you're a writer, declare
                  yourself the best writer - but
                  you're not the best as long as I'm

                  I'll bring it over to Gertrude
                  Stein. She's the only one I trust
                  to read my work. No one discovers
                  new talent like Gert - whether it's
                  poetry, painting, music - She'll
                  tell you if you have a book or not.
                            GIL
                  You could have Gertrude Stein read
                  my novel?
                            HEMINGWAY
                  Give it to me.
                            GIL
                  I have to get it.   It's at the
                  hotel.

               him - he never said.
     Gil goes to return to the cafe - he can't find the door, nor
     the club facade. It's gone.
     We are in the present and he searches the wall of a facade
     where he came out but he is in despair over the fact he can't
     find it.

               exactly as we've come to know her
               from articles and books - she's
               mercurial and moody and she does

               Right, right - er where's my cold

               idle chatter because we're going to
               be late.

                   I believe that love that's true and
                   real creates a respite from death.
                   All cowardice comes from not loving
                   or not loving well which is the
                   same thing and when the man who is
                   brave and true looks death squarely
                   in the face like some rhino hunters
                   I know or Belmonte who is truly
                   brave, it is because they love with
                   sufficient passion to push death
                   out of their minds till it returns
                   as it does to all men and then you
                   must make really good love again.
                   Think about it.

              she's your lover - but we don't

                  you come to Paris to write because
                  these days so many Americans feel
                  the need to move here. Isn't
                  Hemingway attractive? I love his
                  writing.

                  wonderful city for artists and
                  writers.
                            GIL
                  Believe me, I want to but it's not
                  that simple.
                            ADRIANA
                  And I did fall madly in love with
                  the start of your book so I want to
                  hear the rest of it.

               It's a shame you two didn't come to

               wonderfully funny American film. I

               Wonderful but forgettable.     I've
               seen that picture.

                   The juxtaposition of color is
                   amazing. This man was the real
                   father of abstract expressionism.
                   I take that back, maybe Turner.
                             INEZ
                   I prefer Monet. I mean I love
                   Turner but this is overwhelming.
                             PAUL
                   If I'm not mistaken it took him two
                   years to complete this. And he
                   worked out at Giverny - where he

                   I find Monet almost too pretty -
                   like Renoir - sometimes it's
                   cloying.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
                If I'm not mistaken he painted this
                marvelous portrait of his French
                mistress Madeline Brissou in the
                twenties.
                          GIL
                Er - I have to differ with you on
                this one.
                          PAUL
                Really?

                Gil pay attention and you'll learn
                something.
                           GIL
                If I'm not mistaken this was a
                failed attempt to capture a young
                French girl named Adriana - from
                Bordeaux - if my art history serves
                me - came to Paris to study costume
                design for the theatre. Believe
                she had a brief affair with
                Modigliani - then Braque - that's
                where Pablo met her - er Picasso.
                You'd never know it from this
                portrait but she's quite subtly
                beautiful.
                          INEZ
                What have you been smoking?
                          GIL
                And I'd hardly call the picture
                superb. It's more of a petit
                bourgeoise statement of how Pablo
                er Picasso sees her, saw her - he's
                distracted by the fact she was a
                volcano in the sack.

                  I don't know. I see what he earns
                  but sometimes I think he's got a
                  part missing. And I didn't like
                  his remark about tea party
                  Republicans. They're decent people
                  who want to take back the country -
                  they're not crypto-fascist, airhead
                  zombies. Did you hear him say

                            ADRIANA
                  Hello again? How nice you're here.
                             GIL
                  I was at Gertrude Stein's - she's
                  almost finished with my novel. And
                  the Fitzgeralds invited me over and
                  said you'd be here - you and Pablo.
                            ADRIANA
                  Pablo's home - we had a bit of a
                  quarrel. But you looked like you
                  were having fun dancing with Djuna
                  Barnes.
                            GIL
                  That was Djuna Barnes?   No wonder
                  she wanted to lead.
                            ADRIANA
                  Isn't this a wonderful place to
                  throw a party - only the
                  Fitzgeralds would think of it.
                  Look - this is from the turn of the
                  century. Everything was so
                  beautiful then.

              Yes, she's chosen Picasso - But

               rhinoceros?
                         GIL
               A rhinoceros?    I never thought
               about it.
                          DALI
               I paint rhinoceros. I paint you -
               sad eyes - big lips - melting over
               hot sand - with one tear - yes -
               and in your tear - Christ's face.
               And rhinoceros.
                         GIL
               I'm sure I look sad. I'm in a very

                  I'm marrying her.

                  Love - the word love - love - the
                  word love - same as the word
                  rhinoceros - the rhinoceros makes
                  love by mounting the female - but
                  is there difference in beauty
                  between two rhinoceroses?

              Hello - Bonjour - I'd like to ask
              you a question about Rodin.

              Yes?

              Yeah, pedantic - perfect word.
              You're very observant. I need some
              advice. I'd like a woman's take. A
              French woman - an observant French
              woman. I met some woman that I
              very quickly became smitten with.

              I'm engaged to be married. I know
              Rodin had a wife and a mistress but
              I'm American - we can't handle that

                  there's another big problem. I
                  can't exactly explain.

               Oh Pender - I'll get to your book
               in a moment. I finished it. We're
               just in the middle of a little
               personal crisis.
                         GIL
               I didn't mean to intrude.
                         STEIN
               No, it's no secret. Adriana has
               left Pablo and has flown to Africa
               with Ernest Hemingway.

               What?
                         PABLO
               Sabia que tenia una obsesi6n con
               este fanforr6n. Sobre esto
               discutimos.
                          STEIN
               Estoy seguro que regresara muy
               devoto.

               your nerves pretty quickly. Mt.

               Now about your book. Very unusual
               indeed. In a way it's almost
               science fiction - fiction with all
               the futuristic devices - television
               sets, supersonic flight - and yet
               it's not typical science fiction -
               it's unique.

               Nevertheless you have to get rid of
               all that technology - what's good
               about your book are the characters -
               the human questions - love -
               mortality - nobody cares about the
               technology, they care about the
               human heart. We all fear death and
               question our place in the universe.
               Unfortunately your book lapses into
               easy pessimism. I was having this
               conversation with Giacometti the
               other day - he's such a gloom
               monger.
                         GIL
               Still, those sculptures -
                          STEIN
               It's the artist's job not to
               succumb to despair but to find an
               antidote to the emptiness of
               existence. I find your voice clear
               and lively - don't be such a
               defeatist.

               love with me but for whatever
               inexplicable reasons the heart has,
               I am drawn to Gil. Perhaps because
               he seems naive and unassuming.

               I had a dream where he came to me
               and brought me a little gift -
               earrings they were - and we made
               love. perhaps it is just as well I
               accept Hemingway's offer to go to
               Africa. Life with Pablo is too
               full of conflict and I am
               suffocating under his genius. Why
               I need to go from one brilliant man
               to another is my weakness. Gil is
               different, perhaps not a genius but
               not moody and selfish like Pablo or
               Amedeo was. I think a trip to
               Africa with Hemingway would help
               get these feelings for Gil off my
               mind.

     Amidst the ad-lib moment, Gil has managed to secure a private
     spot and has swiped the box. He's torn it open and removing

                  and left them out or dropped them,
                  and the maid found them and left
                  them out where you could see them
                  easily.

               stay together the veneer of

                  noisy and complicated - not like
                  the Belle Epoque. In those years
                  Paris lived only for beauty.
                             GIL
                  I've always been a logical person.
                  I never took chances - did anything
                  crazy - like move here when I first
                  came or take a shot at being a real
                  writer, not a Hollywood hired hand -

                  The twenties are full of strife and
                  uncertainty. But think of it, Gil -
                  the two of us - in a lovely art
                  nouveau home - I'll work in the
                  fashion world - I love the styles -
                  you can write ··· it's the age of
                  Debussy and Guimard. Maybe you can
                  meet Balzac.
                            GIL
                  But what happened to the twenties
                  and the Charleston and Cole Porter?
                            ADRIANA
                  That's the present, it's dull.

                    It's not the present for me - I'm
                    from 2010.
                              ADRIANA
                    What do you mean?
                              GIL
                    I dropped in on you just the way we
                    dropped in on the 1890's.
                               ADRIANA
                    You did?
                              GIL
                    I wanted to escape my present just
                    like you wanted to escape yours.
                    To a golden age.
                              ADRIANA
                    Surely you don't think the twenties
                    are a golden age?
                              GIL
                    To me they are.
                               ADRIANA
                    But I'm from the twenties and I'm
                    tellin~ you the golden age is the
                    Belle Epoque.
                              GIL
                    Yes but don't you see - to these
                    guys the golden age was the
                    Renaissance. They'd all trade the
                    Belle Epoque to paint alongside
                    Michelangelo or Titian. And those
                    guys probably imagine life was
                    better when Kubla Khan was around.
                    I'm having an insight. A minor one
                    but that accounts for the anxiety
                    of my dream.
                              ADRIANA
                    What dream?

                    Last night I dreamed I ran out of
                    zithromax - and then I went to the
                    dentist and there was no novacaine -
                    these people have no antibiotics -

                              ADRIANA
                    What are you talking about?
                              GIL
                    And even in the twenties - no
                    dishwashers - no 911 if your
                    appendix bursts - no "movies on
                    demand" ·
                              ADRIANA
                    But if we love each other what does
                    it matter when we live?
                               GIL
                    Because if you stay here and this
                    becomes your present, sooner or
                    later you'll imagine another time
                    was really the golden time. And so
                    will I - I'm beginning to see why
                    it can't work, Adriana. The
                    present has a hold on you because
                    it's your present and while there's
                    never any progress in the most
                    important things, you get to
                    appreciate - what little progress
                    is made - the internet - Pepto-
                    Bismol. The present is always
                    going to seem unsatisfying because
                    life itself is unsatisfying -
                    that's why Gauguin goes back and
                    forth between Paris and Tahiti,
                    searching - it's my job as a writer
                    to try and come up with reasons why
                    despite life being tragic and
                    unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
                               ADRIANA
                    That's the problem with writers -
                    you're all so full of words - but
                    I'm more emotional. I'm going to
                    stay and live in Paris' most
                    glorious time. You made a choice
                    to leave Paris once and you
                    regretted it.
                              GIL
                    Yes, that one I regretted but it
                    was a real choice and I made the
                    wrong one. This is a choice
                    between accepting reality or
                    surreal insanity.
                                                                      83

                            ADRIANA
                  So finally you do love Inez more
                  than me.
                            GIL
                  No - I love you - but this way lies
                  madness - and if I'm ever going to
                  write anything worthwhile I've got
                  to get rid of my illusions and that
                  I'd be happier in the past is one
                  of them.

                  I had a private detective follow

                  I did. He saw him get into a car
                  at midnight each night and he
                  followed close behind.

     Gil walking at night. He sees someone approaching and

               Hey, I know you - the girl at the
               flea market.
                         GABRIELLE
               Oh yes - yes - the Cole Porter one.
                         GIL
               What are you doing here?
                          GABRIELLE
               I'm returning from dinner with my
               girlfriends. I live near here.

               to Paris this week.

               Oh I'm sure you'll love it.

                         GABRIELLE
               That's okay. I don't mind getting
               wet. Paris is the most beautiful
               in the rain.

               Oh what a thing to say.     I couldn't
               agree more.

               I just thought about you the other

          ALICE (V.0.)
          Think of the future, and events
          that will have already happened.

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

          ALICE PERRY (30s), her innate and amiable authority eclipsed
          only by a self-consciousness about her hair, afraid perhaps
          that she hasn't lived up to the promise of its red color,
          chalks "Futur Anterieur" in precise cursive at the board.

                         ALICE
          "By tomorrow, we will have flown to
          France."
          She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS.
          Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are
          simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination
          that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior.

                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Who can give me an example? Paul?
           NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should be

                         
          read as in FRENCH with ENGLISH subtitles.

                         PAUL
          "I will have completed the assigned
          translation by the end of
          vacation."

                         ALICE
          C'est bon! Amber?

                         AMBER
          I will have failed French again by
          the end of the year.
          Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy.

                         ALICE
          En francais si'l vows plait?

          So, the definition of the
          derivative of the function "f" at
          point "x" is..?

                         CONTINUED:
          EMMA LINDGARD (late 20's) rapidly scribbles a complex 
          calculus formula at the board while all of her TWELFTH GRADE
          MALE STUDENTS avidly admire her shape in a tight, stylish
          skirt and heels. She turns suddenly, smiling brightly.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Okay! Kyle?
          KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover.

                         KYLE
          Um... I guess I'm a little lost.
          If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a
          constant state of cheerful, blonde overflow, even when a
          level of wilfulness is required.

                         EMMA
          Try to follow along. I really want
          you guys to get this! David?
          DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Cindy?

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HOME ARTS LAB - DAY

          TWO GIRLS ( 17) laugh conspiratorially, dredging woven pot
          holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a
          sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast.
          The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY (30's) who tears recipes
          from a Gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room.
          Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup,
          Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference.
          She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls
          leap back with a shriek, shakes her head.
          The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the
          handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down, instantly
          snuffing the flames.
          They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke.

                         MEG
          Do me a favor, and let's just try
          to get to vacation.
          The class bell RINGS!

          You can burn the school down as
          soon as we're back.

          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          Alice, a heavy bag slung over her shoulder, and her boyfriend
          RICHARD (30's, scruffily handsome in sweats and a coach's
          jersey), carrying three binders and a bag of baseball bats,
          exit the school among a crush of students.
          Together, they cross a lawn dotted with patches of late snow,
          to the parking lot, stopping at Alice's weathered Volvo where
          Richard hands over the binders with a kiss.

                         RICHARD
          Got practice until five thirty,
          then I'll be by.

                         ALICE
          I'll see you then. Thanks.
          They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic
          fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves.

                          RICHARD
          Hey, Meg! Bon voyage!
          Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car.

                         ALICE
          I finished our travel binders!
          Meg takes the binder, looks it over.

                         MEG
          Remind me again why we're taking
          phonebooks to France?
          Alice gives her a look.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          I love my binder. I do.

                         ALICE
          Where's Emma? She knows we're
          meeting, right?

          You know, for the first time in a
          long time, I feel just as lucky as 
          any of these kids. They may have
          their whole lives ahead of them but
          we've got a week in Paris.

                         ALICE
          Oh, that's right. I keep
          forgetting your life is completely
          over. So sad. I'm really going to
          miss you.

                         MEG

                         EMMA
          Well, that was a close call!
          They turn to see Emma. crossing the parking lot holding a
          quality knock-off designer handbag over her head.

          You know what we should do, Meg?
          When we're over there? we should

          INT. MEG'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Meg pulls a well-worn stuffed dog from her open suitcase on
          the couch, holding it up to her daughter, FINN (6) who wears
          a spangled tutu and cowboy boots.

                         FINN
          She wants to see Paris, too!

                         MEG
          Finn, if Edith goes to Paris with
          me, she can't go to Daddy's with
          you.
          Finn's brows come together as she considers this, then
          reaches for the dog.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          That's what I thought.

                         (CALLING)
          Seamus!
          SEAMUS, Meg's ten year old son, pounds down the stairs
          carrying an enormous backpack as Meg zips her bag closed.

                         

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          Toothbrush?
          Seamus makes a face, drops his bag and heads back up the
          stairs as the doorbell rings.

                         FINN
          Daddy!

          children tightly.

          you do. Nine o'clock.

          Seam, why don't you take your
          sister to the car while your mom
          and I talk.

          No. No.
           Meg watches her kids run to the squad car parked at the curb,
          just as KARYN (30's, also in uniform) emerges on the
          passenger side to meet them.

                         GLENN
          And no lights!

                         KARYN
          Hey, Meg!
          Meg lifts her chin in greeting, but that's it.

                         GLENN
          I uh... I heard from my lawyer.
          She said you'd signed your papers.
          Meg watches her kids climb in the car with Karyn.

                          GLENN (CONT'D)
           Guess that makes us official, then.

                         MEG
          You and me?
          (a nod to the car)
          Or...

                         GLENN
          You and me, Meg.
          A beat as they look at one another, hold.

                         SEAMUS
          Mom!
          Seamus reappears, charging up the walk to pull Meg down to
          his level, hugging her.

          Have fun.

          Emma's packed suitcases stand neatly arranged by the door of
          the sparsely furnished, undecorated room.

          Leaning on the lip of the kitchen's bar, Emma presses the
          record button on her answering machine, then speaks with a
          put-on, coolly sophisticated,'jet-setting accent.

                         EMMA
          Hello. You've reached the home of
          Emma Lindgard. I'm afraid I won't
          be able to return your call right

          African encampment with children on the television.

                         EMMA
          Ooh!
          She hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee 
          table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved
          Lean Cuisine dinner.
          She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the
          cards, shuffling.
          Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly
          shoots her hands three feet wide, rifling the cards in
          perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp.

          EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Alice opens the door, kissing Richard who holds up a suitcase
          in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other.

                         RICHARD
          Special delivery.

          INT. ALICE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Alice zips the suitcase shut and raises her arms in victory
          as Richard pours the Champagne into two glasses.

          Alice takes her glass and presses Richard down onto the bed,
          climbing on top of him.

                         ALICE
          Like Christmas when I was a kid.
          There's no way I'm going to be able

          I mean, how long have I been
          talking about this?

          Mmm... You were reading Colette.
          In the teacher's lounge. First
          time we met. Long time.
          Alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside.

          This is just the beginning.

          It feels like it.
          They clink glasses and Richard watches Alice tip her glass
          back then stop mid-sip to peer down at the delicate diamond
          ring sitting at the bottom of her glass.

          Meg sleeps in an aisle seat of the dim coach cabin where all
          the window shades have been drawn down, Emma dozing beside
          her, a game of cards laid out on her tray table.

                         
          Alice brings her seat to the upright position as instructed
          and sits, hyper-alert, looking at her closed window shade.
          A beat.
          She reaches out and raises the shade a tentative crack,
          flooding their row with light.
          She glances furtively around the cabin, then inches the shade
          higher, drawing in a sharp breath at what she sees.
          She flings the shade up.
          ALL OF PARIS is laid out below her; a magical nautilus-like
          wheel with the Eiffel Tower as its central axle.
          Her breath steams the window as she drinks it all in.
          She turns, eyes full, to Meg who cranes across Emma to share
          in the view and squeeze Alice's arm with a smile.

          EXT. THE LOUVRE - DAY 

          The bus hurtles around the drive, screeching to a halt,
          bouncing roughly on its shocks at the museum's entrance.

           INT. LOUVRE - DAY

          Alice, Meg and Emma race past gallery after gallery, trying
          to keep Madame Valery's little blue flag in sight as it flies
          over the crowd in the distance.
          Alice whipsaws her head at everything they're missing, making
          notes in her guidebook on the fly.

                         ALICE
          Try to remember that! We'll double
          back for the Chagalls!

          INT. LOUVRE - DAY

          Madame Valery leads the charge up the right wing of the Daru
          staircase, past the statue of Winged Victory.
          Alice stops Meg and Emma in front of the statue, while Carl
          and Deedee try to catch their breath on the landing.

                         

                         ALICE

          Greek goddess Nike, meaning
          victory. Two-twenty to one-ninety
          B. C. Okay, go!
          They head for the right stairs just as Madam Valery
          reappears, descending with her group on the left.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          Oh.
          Alice turns Meg and Emma around to come back down.

                         DEEDEE
          Well, that saved us a climb.

          INT. LOUVRE - DAY

          Emma elbows her way out of a crush of raised cameras and
          cellphones to Alice and Meg who strain at the rear of the
          CROWD to view a painting, all but the top of its gold frame
          obscured.

          INT. BISTRO - NIGHT

          Meg and Emma sit hunched over Emma's camera and its shaky,
          digital image of the Mona Lisa, squeezed in with Alice and
          the rest of their tour at too few tables.

                         EMMA
          Alice, I'll e-mail it to you.
          Meg looks up, catching Alice eyeing their surroundings.

                         MEG
          (re: Mona Lisa)
          At least she's smiling.

                         ALICE
          (snaps to, smiling)
          What? No. I'm--. I'm just a
          little tired.

                         EMMA
          (a happy idea)

                         
          Hey! I'll bet you have jet lag!
          We'll probably all get it!
          Meg raises a glass of wine.

                         MEG
          To jet lag.
          Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk
          down identical plates of steak frites before them.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          To Alice. Best organizer. Best
          guide. Best friend.

                         EMMA
          To Alice!
          They clink glasses and Alice is suddenly jostled, just as
          she's about to sip, by Carl as he turns from the table behind
          her, spilling her wine.

                         DEEDEE
          Oh, Carl!

                         IT'S OKAY--

                         DEEDEE
          He was just looking for the catsup-

                         CARL
          If you're not using it.
          As Emma passes the bottle of catsup, Meg offers Alice her
          napkin, and waiters sweep their plates away, replacing them
          with creme brulees.

                         ALICE
          Oh! No. Wait. Pardon, Monsieur--

                         CARL

                         (RECEIVING CATSUP)
          Merci!
          He turns now, catsup in hand, to blink at the creme brulee
          that has replaced his own and Deedee's steaks.

                         
          Alice places a hand on Madam Valery's arm as she passes.

                         ALICE
          Pardon, Madame, but...
          Madam Valery slowly raises her eyes from Alice's hand.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, but--

                         MEG
          Are you apologizing?

          They've taken our dinners away--
          Madame Valery taps her watch and then her clipboard.

           EXT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Esprit de Corps tour members disembark from their bus in
          front of a comically narrow and vertical Baroque hotel with
          its name in feeble buzzing neon: Le Petit Sommeil.

                         ALICE (PRE-LAP)
          Look! Look at this picture and
          tell me what's different!

          INT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          The women lower the travel brochure and its photograph of a
          tidy well-appointed suite, to regard the actual one in which
          they stand; dingy, impossibly small, crowded by an armoire
          that nearly meets the low sloping ceiling, with two spindly
          twin beds and a military-style cot.

                         EMMA
          Toujour le suck-ez vous.

                         ALICE
          I researched at least a million

                         TOURS--

                          MEG
          Well. This is the one we could
          afford.
          A beat as they consider the room and their lot in life.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          It's only five nights--

                         EMMA
          Five nights? Here?!

                         MEG
          And, Alice, you said yourself,
          we'll hardly ever be in our room.

                         (SELLING IT)
          It'll be like camping. At Eagle
          River. It'll be fun!
          Emma opens what is essentially a closet with a toilet.

                         EMMA
          Here's your outhouse, Meg. Go
          nuts.
          Alice joins Emma at the bathroom door.

          Okay, Emma. Let's just unpack--
          she turns for the luggage, nearly falling over at the weight
          of Emma's suitcase as she reaches to lift it.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          Holy--! Alice, help--
          Alice climbs onto one of the beds to help Meg lift.

                         ALICE
          Emma, what have you got in here?

                         EMMA
          Just the stuff you put on my list--
          (off her look)
          And a couple options.
          The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the
          bed which collapses, catapulting Alice onto the cot which
          flips up over her, knocking Emma into the tiny bathroom.

                         

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Hey! Come on, guys!

          INT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Alice gazes out a window that opens onto a narrow alley and
          the ugly backsides of buildings, as Meg and Emma sleep
          fitfully behind her.
          She looks down at the cellphone in her hands, scrolling
          through her speed dial to stop at: 1. Richard.
          She hesitates with her thumb over the "call" button.
          She turns back to the miserable view, considering for a beat,
          then folds her phone away as she blinks back tears.

          EXT. PONT DES ARTS BRIDGE - DAY

          Madame Valery leads a diminished flock, bobbing her staff
          with its blue flag, in a forced march across the span of the
          ornate pedestrian bridge toward the waiting tour bus.

           MADAME VALERY
          The Pont des Arts has it's name for
          the vast number of art students
          that come here to paint this famous
          city view...
          Meg and Emma, the worse for wear, trail Madame Valery at a
          distance with Alice who now leads her own handful of tour
          members, Carl and Deedee among them.

                         ALICE
          It's called the Pont des Arts
          because the Louvre was formally
          known as the Palais des Arts...
          Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and
          her cluster of appreciative followers.

                         MADAME VALERY
          People! We must keep together!

          EXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL -- DAY

          Alice's group circles an inscribed stone medallion with a
          star-shaped brass inset on the pavement outside Notre Dame.

                         

                         DEEDEE
          "Point zero. Dez roots dee France."

                         ALICE
          It's from right here that all the
          highway miles in all of France are
          measured. They also say that if
          you stand on this exact spot, you
          are be destined to return to France
          in the future.

                         MEG
          Oh, I'm in! Come on. Everyone!
          Together, they all step forward, arms entwined, laughing.

          I want a picture! Of all of us!
          Alice looks up as Emma breaks away, to see Madam Valery
          leading her dwindling group from the great church.
          Madame Valery sends her charges to the bus, then heads
          straight for Alice as Emma tries to enlist a JAPANESE COUPLE
          to take a group photo with her camera.

          folded arms and steely resolve before Madame Valery.

                         MADAME VALERY
          Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied

          silent a beat; a crowd anticipating fireworks.
          CLICK! The Japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff,
           the sound of the shutter triggering Alice to action.

          With lightning speed, she seizes Madame Valery's flag. 

                         CROWD
          Whoa!
          Madame Valery, nonplussed, reaches out to reclaim her flag,
          but Alice jerks it further away, while the Japanese woman
          snaps picture after picture.

                         DEEDEE
          Carl, we're getting on the bus!
          Madame Valery lunges for the stick.

          EXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY

          The bus pulls away, revealing the Japanese couple who return
          Emma's camera with a bow, Meg, and Alice holding the flag.

                         EMMA
          That was fantastic!

          Alice brings the staff down across her knee, snapping it in
          two, casting the broken ends into the gutter as she raises
          herself to her full height.

                         ALICE
          Now, the real tour can begin!

          Alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall.

          I think it's starting to rain--

          Water pours in sheets from the sky as Alice, Meg and Emma
          splash down the Rue de Rivoli and duck beneath the shelter of
          the hotel's canopy.
          They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their
          sopping clothes.

          They glance over at a few PAPARAZZI sharing the protection of
          the overhang on the far side of the entrance, as a camera
          flashes in taking Emma's picture.
          Emma smiles, blinks, confused as another photographer
          admonishes the first.

          What're they saying?

                         
          Alice looks about in equal confusion, but stops short when
          she sees the opulent restaurant behind the window's glass.

                         ALICE
          Oh.
          Meg and Emma turn to gape as well at the DINERS and elegant
          tables inside as the rain hammers down.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          That, mes aims, is Paris.

          Meg and Emma step into the lobby, a palatial world of marble,

          They turn for the dining room, passing the front desk where
          CORDELIA WINTHROP SCOTT (dressed similarly to Emma, though at
          ten times the cost) unleashes her ire on the CONCIERGE.

          Emma swings through the door into the black marble bathroom,
          grabbing a towel to swipe at her wet hair.
          She stops abruptly, examines the towel.

                         EMMA
          These are cloth!
          She takes the towel into one of the stalls, closing the door
          behind her just as Cordelia strides in, stops at the counter.

          She takes her phone into the stall next to Emma's and closes
          the door just as Alice and Meg enter.

          A toilet flushes and Cordelia opens her stall door, heads for
          the counter, oblivious to Alice and Meg who freeze with their
          towels, blinking at her uncanny resemblance to Emma.

          It appears to be raining outside.

          Alice enters, steering around a tower of Louis Vuitton
          luggage, as Meg pulls a fresh bottle of Champagne from a
          bucket of ice.

                         ALICE
          Wait. What are you guys doing?
          Emma launches herself onto the enormous bed.

                         EMMA
          This is the room we were supposed
          to have!

                         ALICE
          On what planet? Come on. We were
          only going to take a look!

          So, we're looking.

          Meg takes the bottle and crawls up with Emma.

          Alice considers, looks out the window at the streaming rain.

                         ALICE
          Okay. But, just until it stops
          raining. Then we go.

          Well... We'll never know.
          Seen from the bed, the light atop the Eiffel tower breaks
          through the dissipating clouds to swing a searching arc
          through the night sky...

          A telephone rings, stirring Alice. It rings again.
          She reaches for it in her sleep as Emma sits up groggily
          beside Meg curled around the empty Champagne bottle.

          Alice and Meg as he consults his wristwatch.

          I'm terribly sorry, but, I am
          already late for a meeting--

          We won't keep you--

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          I just wanted to make sure you
          arrived safely and that I was here
          to greet you.

                         (AN AFTERTHOUGHT)

          Again, I am so sorry, but, I am
          reluctant to keep His Highness
          waiting.

                         EMMA
          His Highness?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          The Prince. But, we will see each
          other at the casino for tonight's
          game. Please, bring your friends--

                         ALICE
          You are very generous, and we'd
          love to, but, I'm afraid Cordelia
          has other plans this evening--
          Jean-Pierre turns, charmed by Alice's perfect French, and
          alarmed by this news.

          must be there for tonight's game.
          The prince. His Highness has asked
          to be seated across from her--

          What's he saying? Which prince?
          Jean-Pierre looks imploringly between the three.

          Please. It is for the foundation.

          Within a glossy brochure: A collage of "snapshots" shows
           happy African children grouped outside their new school;
          raising their hands at their desks in a pristine classroom;
          finding their country on a glossy globe.

          No, I can't. I can't stand it.
          Emma reads to Alice and Meg from the brochure in the seating
          area of their luxurious suite, enjoying none of it, nor the
          incredible balcony view of Monte Carlo's marina and bay.

          trunks and cases while Emma idly thumbs the combination lock
          of a steel briefcase in her lap.

          Okay. But, just for tonight. And,

          DOORMEN for Alice, Emma and Meg to make their big entrance in
          Cordelia's couture chiffon, silk and organza.
          Heads held high, backs straight, they strike a remarkable
          tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the room's
          raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels and the
           tony European jet set.

          At first glance they look spectacular, but under closer 
          scrutiny one can read Meg's composed discomfort in wearing a
          dress that is too tight, nearly spilling her breasts, and the
          self-consciousness Alice endures in a dress made daringly
          short by her height.
          But, this is because we know them; to all other eyes they not
          only belong here, they own the room.
          They glance at one another, eyebrows up: "We're here!"

          SILVANO (30's, movie-star handsome), both in tuxedos,
          offering a hand to escort Emma down the few steps.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Mademoiselle Scott, you made it!
          Emma withholds her natural smile, placing just the tips of
          her fingers in Jean-Pierre's palm with exaggerated hauteur.

          Enchante. 
          Jean-Pierre assists Meg and Alice, Meg clutching the top of
          her dress, Alice anxiously keeping the skirt of hers in place
          with a hand as she steps down.

          And why aren't you playing?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Ah. I play behind the scenes.
          Like Robin Hood, I take from those
          who have more than enough, for
          those who have nothing but need.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Also, I do not play because I have
          no money of my own.

          Together they turn to see Emma happily arranging the cards
          she is dealt in her hands.

          ashen, and turns to the players who smile expectantly.

                         MEG
          A riot.
          Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot.

                         DOMENICO
          Mademoiselle Scott starts us at ten
          thousand a hand.
          Alice and Meg freeze, their champagne glasses sliding from
          their hands, while Emma's eyes grow as large as all the
          zeroes on Domenico's chip.

                         DOMENICO (CONT'D)
          You must be feeling very lucky.

          Emma sits locked in a cool stare-down over the top of her 
          cards with Domenico across from her at the tensed table.
          Meg downs a glass of Champagne in one gulp, snagging the back
          of the WAITER's jacket, hauling him back for a refill.
          The waiter turns to Alice, who pats at her face with a damp
          napkin, struggling to breathe.

                         MEG
          (takes bottle from waiter)
          I should probably keep this.

                         (PRODDING)
          Mademoiselle?
          Emma places her cards face down before her, appears to fold.

                         EMMA
          Well...
          She moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside
          her, and pushes them to the center of the table.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)

                         0
          I'm all in.
          The other players gasp and Alice fails to suppress a whimper
          as she grasps Meg's pouring hand, spilling Champagne, drawing
          Jean-Pierre's attention.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Are you alright?

                         ALICE
          Great. I'm just--. Excuse me.
          Alice slips around the railing and heads for Emma as two
          players fold in near tears, leaving just Emma, Domenico and a
          DOWAGER (60's) in the game.

                          ALICE (CONT'D)
          I'm terribly sorry to interrupt.
          But, Cordelia, you look a little
          overheated... Why don't we--?

          I will see you, Cordelia.
          Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the
          center of the table and Alice buries her face in her hands
          when the dowager folds her cards.

                         EMMA

          Now, go sit down and try to be
          cool, would you? Jeeze! Let me
          handle this.
          Alice moves back to her stool, tries to smile as she takes
          the water Jean-Pierre offers.

          Ladies first.

                         EMMA
          After you. Please.
          Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his
          three aces.

                         DOMENICO
          I am very sorry, Cordelia.
          A beat, then Emma shrugs.

                         EMMA
          Well. It is just a game after all.
          She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A
          royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          I do hope there are no hard
          feelings.
          The other players cheer as Domenico's smile crashes.
          Emma shrieks with delight, turning to Alice and Meg who grab
          each other, barely keeping themselves from pitching over,
          glasses spilling, as the other players applaud.
          Emma rakes in the Everest of multi-colored chips with both
          arms, laughing as she's congratulated.

                         DOWAGER
          You must play often, Miss Scott.

                         EMMA
          Oh, a little, online. But, this is
          so much more fun!

          Domenico and Jean-Pierre, each toting buckets of chips,
          escort Alice, Emma and Meg to the elevator, all giddy.

          further.

                         MEG
          Yeah. Good call, Cordelia.
          DING! The elevator arrives and the doors open as Domenico
          leans in towards Emma.

                         DOMENICO
          Then you must promise to dance with
          me at my party tomorrow.
          Emma evades Domenico by stepping onto the elevator.

          Meg collects the buckets from Domenico and steps on.

                         MEG
          Great meeting you, your Highness.
          Good times. Really.
          Jean-Pierre places his buckets in Alice's hands, a certain
          frisson to the simple exchange.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Tomorrow night?

          Wait!
          Before Alice can respond to Jean-Pierre, Emma takes one of
          the buckets from Alice and hands it back to him.

          Good night, then.

          And, welcome to Monte Carlo.
          The doors close, leaving Jean-Pierre and Domenico to gaze
          fondly where the three women had just been.
          They both sigh and turn for the bar, when they hear shrieking
          from the elevator as it rises above them.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          Alice, Meg and Emma jump up and down, screaming like girls at
          a slumber party, chips flying everywhere.

          Alice, Meg and Emma burst through the salon doors into the
          street, their hair color richer, eyes brighter, a new
          lightness to their step; vivid, brilliantly polished versions
          of their essential selves.
          Heads turn as they set out together.

          INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

          The wings of a brass-framed three-way mirror spin and spread
          in a swirling kaleidoscope of shifting reflections:
          Alice, Meg and Emma work their way through an increasingly
          spectacular and audacious series of combinations, dresses and
          gowns, modeling for each other as they are tended to by
          SHOPGIRLS and SEAMSTRESSES...
          --Alice twirls in a navy dress with white polka dots.
          --Meg slaps her own ass with a laugh, admiring herself from

          the crowded market stalls heaped with fountains of flowers in
          every color, breads, fresh produce, trinkets and souvenirs.

                         ALICE
          No. I'm not going to tell you what
          to do.

                         MEG

          Emma leaps to one of the stalls, seizing a profusion of 
          plastic jeweled tiaras displayed alongside photographs of

          She thought it would be on Alice's
          next birthday, but I knew it was
          going to be this trip to France!

                         GLENN
          Sure! That's why Alice loves you.
          You get how much this trip's meant
          to her; now, you're just putting
          the icing on the cake. The big
          gesture, you know? Not too
          dominating: Supportive. Loving!

          You're the man, Richard. Big

          EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

          BERNARD ROCHAND (late 30's), an appealing Frenchman in a worn

                         
          sportscoat, pauses in collecting leeks when he spots Meg on
          the other side of the open stall.
          He watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce,
          lifting a tomato to her nose, inhaling with a private smile.
          Meg bites into the tomato, spurting juice onto her cheek and
          down her front.
          She looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away, stopping
          when she catches Bernard smiling with amusement.
          Meg rolls her eyes with self-deprecation and moves on along
          the line of stalls.
          Bernard pays for his purchase and follows, finding Meg at
          another stall where a FRENCHWOMAN tries to communicate how to
          prepare the fish they both admire.
          Meg nods, not entirely understanding, but getting enough of
          it to gesture responses.
          The woman grabs some newspaper, wrapping the fish, and
          thrusts it towards Meg with a smile.

          Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. I'd like
          to. But...
          The woman is confused, vaguely insulted.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          I don't have a kitchen. No place
          to cook.

                         BERNARD
          She is only a visitor. Without a
          kitchen. But, it is a beautiful
          fish. Maybe next time.
          Meg turns to find Bernard beside her.

                         BERNARD (CONT'D)
          I have explained.
          Meg hesitates uncertainly before this friendly stranger.

                         MEG
          Well, thank you...
          She smiles at the woman and starts to walk away, only to find

                         
          Bernard falling into step with her.

                         BERNARD
          You are American.
          Meg glances at Bernard and away, uncomfortable, but curious,
          drawn by his warmth and the familiar greetings he exchanges
          with various vendors as they walk.

                         MEG
          From Wisconsin. Yes.
          Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg.

                         BERNARD
          You cook in Wisconsin?
          Meg uses the handkerchief to blot the remaining tomato juice.

                         MEG
          I try. But... We don't have even
          half of this at home.
          She points to a tray of miniature lobsters.

          Meg shakes his hand and returns the handkerchief.

          Meg. Kelly. Thank you again for

                         BERNARD
          And, how long are you in Monte
          Carlo, Meg?
          Meg's brow furrows slightly and she turns to head back.

                         MEG

          She slips into the moving crowd, leaving Bernard to watch as

          He holds a beat, then turns when called to by a vendor.

          INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Glenn paces as Richard holds the phone at his desk, the
          Esprit de Corps Tours website on his computer's screen.

                         RICHARD
          It's been two days and it didn't
          occur to you to call anyone?

           EXT. PALAIS DE CHAILLOT - DAY

          Madame Valery, cellphone to her ear, leads'the few remaining
          members of her flock down the wide steps, across the Seine
          from the Eiffel tower.

                         MADAME VALERY
          She refused to follow my
          instructions. She sabotaged my

          INT. VILLA DA SILVANO - NIGHT

          A cascade of yellow and gold balloons washes over Alice as
          she dances with Meg and Emma to a Euro-trance-pop beat at the
          center of the crowded dance floor.
          Emma screams with delight in a new dress and plastic tiara,
          batting balloons as Domenico who spins her away.
          Alice watches with heightened vigilance as Emma dances with
          her prince and blows a kiss to Alice and Meg.

          And I was looking for you!
          From the edge of the dance floor, NIKOLAI LUDOVIC (late 30s),
          squat, bald, completely nondescript but for his white tie and
          tails, watches Emma ardently.
          He stops a waiter, taking his tray of Champagne flutes.

                         
          Emma spins to find Nikolai at her elbow, grinning, holding up
          this offering, and she takes him for a waiter.

          Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty!
          Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile,
          watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks.
          She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai,
          really registering his presence now as she searches his warm,

          She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her
          back to evade him.

          She dodges away from Jean-Pierre, hooking Meg's arm in
          passing, yanking her away from Giorgio as she heads for Emma.

                         PENELOPE
          Don't pretend you don't remember!
          Third year at Le Rosey! You threw
          my luggage in the pool. Set fire
          to my mattress. You cut off all my

                         HAIR--

                         MEG
          What? That's awful!

          That was just the first night.

                         ALICE
          Say you're sorry, Cordelia.

                         (WHISPERS)
          And let's get out of here!

                         EMMA
          Alice, no--. Wait a minute--

                         PENELOPE
          (to Alice and Meg)
          she turned all my friends against
          me... They had to send me away...
          To live with the nuns--
          Emma grabs Penelope by the shoulders.

                         EMMA
          Now, you listen to me, Penelope
          Penrose. You have no idea how long
          I've waited for this moment.
          Penelope flinches, preparing for a beating.

                         

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          But, I had no way of finding you
          after you left us, and...Oh, Penny.
          Don't you see? Don't you know that
          I was just jealous?
          Alice and Meg exchange looks.

          You were so smart. So clever and

                         PENELOPE
          I was ugly--

          No, Penny. I was ugly. I was a

          compete! Not with anyone as
          special as you.

                         PENELOPE
          You thought I was special?
          Emma looks at Penelope, nods emphatically.

                         EMMA
          You want to know what I've waited
          for all these years, Penelope
          Penrose?
          Penelope shakes her head almost imperceptibly.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          To do this.
          Emma opens her arms wide and pulls Penelope into a hug.
          She looks at Alice and Meg over Penelope's shoulder, and then
          closes her eyes with genuine emotion for a beat, pulling back
          to smile into Penelope's grateful, tear-streaked face.

          To friends! old and new!
          Emma seizes Penelope's hand from across the table, placing it
          in Domenico's as she drunkenly sings the old Girl Scout song.

                         EMMA
          "Make new friends and keep the old,
          one is silver and the other's

          Alice and Jean-Pierre lean toward each other intimately'
          across the packed, lively table of PARTY-GOERS.

          But, no one really lives here.
          Monte Carlo. It's like Hong Kong.
          People merely come and go. People

          Alice nods to a WAITER who arrives to refill her Champagne 
          glass, pouring as Jean-Pierre speaks.

          People like me?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          People with money. This is why I
          come. I help assuage their guilt
          when I remind them that there are
          children in this world who do not
          have clean water to drink, while
          they drink Champagne.

                         ALICE
          And that works?
          Jean-Pierre blinks, then bursts out laughing.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          I take myself far too seriously.

                         ALICE
          No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean--.
          I've seen the pictures of the
          schools. The work you do is

                         

                         ADMIRABLE--

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And I'm afraid I talk about it
          because I myself am not that
          interesting...
          (a hand on her arm)
          I'd rather know about you.

                         ALICE

          Oh. Well. You know. I...do what
          I can, here and there. A little
          volunteer work...
          She turns to her Champagne, rolling her eyes at herself.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          Oh, brother.
          Meg sits further down the length of all the tables laid end
          to end, beside Giorgio, who has pulled his chair close,
          draping an arm casually across the back of hers.

                         MEG

          Yeah, I know: I'm funny. But, see
          if you can answer something for me.
          Ten years you're married, to the
          girl you dated in high school. I'm
          talking the girl you lost your
          virginity to, the one who gave you
          two great kids that you're just
          crazy about. Then one morning,
          what? You wake up, and out of the
          blue, it's like, "Oh, hey, honey, I
          think I'm in love with this other
          woman..."

                         (PAUSES)
          His patrol partner.
          A beat as Giorgio shakes his head sadly.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          I thought I was his partner.
          Giorgio takes Meg hand, more in comfort than come on.

                         GIORGIO
           You heart feels betrayed.

                         MEG
          (telling a secret)
          I feel like I failed.

                         GIORGIO
          I tell you this: A man...he will
          always love the mother of his
          children.
          Meg blinks, taking this in.

                         GIORGIO (CONT'D)
          Now you must kiss someone else.

                         MEG

          Oh, I see--

                         GIORGIO
          To break the spell. You must!
          Then you will be free.
          A plate of beautifully arranged langoustine is placed on the

          Emma pours sloppy glasses of Champagne for her companions as
          though playing a game of tag, spilling wine.

          And you're my friend...and you're

          Oh, hey! You were at the party!
          Do you work here, too?

          Cordelia!
          The spell is broken by a TRIO OF PAPARAZZI who spring to life
          by the hotel's entrance.

                         PAPARAZZI
           Cordelia! Cordelia!

                         EMMA
          Oh, good! I want a picture! Of
          the three of us! All of us!
          The paparazzi swarm from the steps towards Emma.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          By the fountain!
          She runs for the sprays of water, pulling Alice and Meg, and
          the paparazzi meet them, flashing away.
          Leaning against the fountain's balustrade, Emma gestures for
          everyone to join them.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Penelope! Come on. I want one
          with everybody!
          Penelope, Domenico and Jean-Pierre join with other members of
          the group and Emma lines them all up.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)

          He shakes his head, bashful, but Emma gestures him over,

          Nikolai, you, too! I need all my
          friends--Whoops!
          Her feet zip out from beneath her and she sails backwards
          over the balustrade, reaching for Alice and Meg, pulling them
          with her as the camera's flash.

          SPLASH!

          EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

          A 747 airliner touches down on the tarmac.

          Alice's repaired suitcase tumbles off the conveyer belt.

                         

                         RICHARD
          Excuse me. Pardon me.
          Richard skirts around a man with a newspaper to retrieve the
          bag and heads for customs.
          As Richard exits, the man folds his newspaper to its bold
          headline: SCOTT MAKES A SPLASH!, and a huge photograph of
          Emma, Alice and Meg laughing together in the fountain.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY

          Emma enters from the bedroom in a swimsuit and wrap, to find
          Alice hanging up the desk phone.

          fantastic bakery around the corner.
          I've already had three brioche.
          And I saw the greatest little shop

          The car pulls away, Carl and Deedee turning in their seats to
          wave at Alice through the rear window.
          Alice waves until they are out of sight and slowly lowers her
          hand, standing alone in the street.
          A beat.
          Alice sighs and pulls out her guide book, unfolding a map as
          she looks up to gather her bearings.
          She takes in the quiet street, the view of the ocean, then
          looks back at the map in her hands.

                         
          She straightens up, a new look of purpose on her face, and
          crosses the street to toss her guide book and map in the
          trash can on the corner, striking out unaided down a narrow
          twisting street hung with vines and flowers.

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING

          Alice rounds the corner of one street into the tight
          intersection of two narrow alleys in the fading twilight.
          She looks around,.cheeks flushed, hair pasted to her
          forehead, lost in a maze of dilapidated walled courtyards and
          apartment blocks; home to the city's service workers.
          She hesitates, then forges ahead down one street until she
          sees that it dead ends, and she doubles back.

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING

          Alice suppresses panic as she walks briskly up a steep alley,
          high in the hills, trailed now by a small stray DOG.
          She stops, turns to the dog that also stops then sits.

                         ALICE
          is Go. Go home.

          She turns and starts forward, the dog following. 
          Alice stops again, turns, and the dog sits.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          Don't follow me. I have no idea
          where I'm going...
          The dog cocks its head in comment.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          Okay?
          Alice turns to climb the street's incline.
          The dog follows.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON

          Penelope, dressed for the evening, gets up from reclining on
          the bed to join Emma who models a gown before a mirror.
          The two regard Emma's reflection, cocking their heads in an
          identical manner at precisely the same time.
          Penelope draws a necklace in gesture, indicating Emma's bare

                         
          collar bone.
          Emma turns, lit by an idea, and pulls the'steel briefcase
          from its hiding place beneath the bed.

          INT. BISTRO - EVENING

          Meg opens the door from the street, stepping inside, wearing

          He leads her to a table along the wall and holds out a chair.
          Seated, Meg follows him with her eyes to the kitchen where
          Bernard works furiously at the stove, tossing the contents of
          a sauce pan with an expert flick of his wrist.
          Bernard glances out to the dining room, seeming to sense Meg
          before knowing he'll find her there.

           EXT. CAFE - PARIS - EVENING

          A pair of strolling LOVERS draw Richard's attention as he
          massages his stockinged foot at a sidewalk table.
          He watches them stop, kiss, then continue on their way.
          A WAITER returns with Richard's change on a plate and Richard
          fits his shoe back on his foot, gathers his things to stand.
          He stops when he notices the front page of a newspaper folded
          on a chair at the next table.
          He quickly unfolds it to the photograph of Alice and Meg with
          Emma in the fountain, scans down to the caption: Cordelia
          Scott and friends in Monte Carlo. Hotel de Paris, etc...

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING

          Alice feeds the little dog a scrap of meat as she eats a
          kabob, seated on the curb by a street vendor's food cart
          around which ALGERIAN MEN lounge in plastic lawn chairs.
           The dog looks at her avidly, hungry for more.
          Alice holds her kabob stick out for the dog to eat,
          surrendering her dinner with pleasure.
          As Alice sips from a bottle of beer, a soccer ball bounces
          off the curb and rolls to a stop beside her.
          She looks up as a ragtag BAND OF KIDS call from the dusty lot
          across the street, asking for their ball.
          A beat as Alice regards the ball.

          INT./EXT. YACHT PARTY - EVENING

          Emma wears Cordelia's elaborate necklace, standing alone,
          within a throng of PARTY GOERS, all conversing in French.
          she nods and smiles absently, though she's clearly lost, out
          of her element, when Giorgio approaches.

                         GIORGIO
          Where is Meg? I do not see her.

          survey the party, smiling wistfully at Penelope and Domenico
          locked in intimate conversation.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
          Cordelia! There she is! Cordelia!
          The trio of paparazzi putter alongside in a small boat,
          peppering the yacht with their camera flashes.
          Emma looks out at them, without her usual animation.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
          Smile, Cordelia! Please, smile!
          Emma waves, but can't seem to manage that smile.

          Emma turns to find Nikolai standing beside her in white tie,
          a piece of cake extended in one hand, a fork in the other.
          Emma's eyes light up as if a switch has been thrown and the
          flash of a camera records her huge, dazzling smile.

          kids passes the ball to her, chased by the others.
          She dodges and kicks the ball through the goal to score.
          Her "team" jumps and cheers, as do a collection of spectators
          who have gathered to watch this tall red headed woman in a
          summer dress racing around the dusty lot with a band of kids.

          racing up the field as the crowd laughs and claps.
          She passes the ball to kid who drives it to the goal, scores.

          up at the scene, his boisterous friends, the food; as though

                         
          to say "this is good, enjoy."
          Meg relaxes her shoulders and gives in to the spirit of the
          table, spears a bite of food and lifts her glass to Bernard.

                         CUT TO:
          Meg and another chef, locked in a chopping duel, plow though
          onions at a blinding pace, their knives flashing, creating an
          escalating staccato on their cutting boards.
          Meg sweeps her onion from her board to a pan, and slams her
          knife down in victory as all the chefs erupt with applause.
          Henri seizes Meg's hand, raising her arm in the air, and
          presents her with a bottle of wine.
          Meg turns to Bernard, beaming, thrilled, utterly happy, as
          the other chefs clap her on the back, shake her hand.

          Jean-Pierre opens the door at the top of the fire stairs,
          revealing the open sky, turning back to take Alice's hand.

          What's the most amazing place
          you've ever been?

          JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)
          Hard to say. There are many.
          Alice steps out onto the hotel's roof with Jean-Pierre's
          jacket over her shoulders.

          ALICE (V.O.)
          Well, Africa, then. How often do
          you get to go?
          He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the
          building that faces the sea and the lightening sky.

          JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)
          Not enough. Mostly I am on planes.
          To the places where sunlight and
          parties make people generous.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

          Alice's smile flickers with a vague disappointment as she
          leans against the hotel's crown beside Jean-Pierre. 

                         ALICE
          That seems a shame...

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          But, I can think of one place I
          have never been. It is in my
          imagination only, so it is very
          special.
          He places an arm around Alice as they take in the view.

                         JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
          It is just a small town, in a vast,
          open space. Maybe in the middle of
          America. There are people there
          like yourself, who are kind. And
          children who have everything they
          need.
          Alice turns to Jean-Pierre as he takes a strand of her hair
          in his fingers, and they hold a beat, looking at one another.

                         JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
          In my mind, it is bordered by
          fields that are green.

          EXT. YACHT - DAWN

          Nikolai shrugs himself out of his formal shirt to stand
          before Emma in nothing but starfish printed boxer shorts.
          He lifts his hands: This is me. Here I am.
          Emma hesitates, then lets her gown fall around her, bare
          except for her panties, the necklace, and her napkin crown.
          Nikolai pushes himself off the side of the boat at a run,
          hiking up his legs into a cannonball. SPLASH!
          He surfaces and turns back to the boat just as Emma dives in
          with a SPLASH!
          She swims to Nikolai, pushing him under in a child's game,
          and he pops up, spitting water like a fountain.
          They laughs and Emma loops her arms around him.
          A beat as they sober.

                         
          Emma pulls Nikolai close to her, and they kiss.
          On the landing deck, Emma's gown shimmers in the morning sun
          with Nikolai's crown and Cordelia's yellow gem and diamond
          necklace nestled among its satin folds.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - HALLWAY - DAWN

          Alice, still wearing Jean-Pierre's jacket, walks down the
          hall with Jean-Pierre close beside her, neither speaking.
          She turns to him when they reach the door of her suite.
          A long beat stretches, full of every possibility.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Come with me.

                         ALICE
          What?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          To Dubai. I leave the day after--.
          What is today? Friday? I leave
          tomorrow. You could come too. You
           wouldn't need to bring anything.

          (a near confession)
          You don't know me.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          This is why I ask. I would like to
          know you, Alice. Very much.
          Alice regards him a beat, then slowly pulls his jacket from
          her shoulders.

                         ALICE
          Before this, I'd never even been to
          France.
          Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          It's true. Just kept putting it
          off. Always managed to find an
          excuse. But, really, it was that I
          was afraid. That it couldn't ever
          live up to the France I'd imagined.
          And if it did... Then I'd never be
          able to go home.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And, now?
          Alice gently places Jean-Pierre's jacket in his hands and
          steps near to kiss him on the lips.

                         ALICE
          But, thank you.
          She turns and opens the door with her key as Jean-Pierre
          smiles ruefully.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          For everything.
          Alice steps into her room and closes the door.

          ATTENDANT in his broken French.

          Excusez-moi...I'm looking for the
          train. To Monte Carlo.
          Behind him, Cordelia strides through a set of doors to stop
          directly at Richard's back as she searches the terminal and
          hisses into her cellphone.

                         CORDELIA
          Yes, Daddy, I'm here. No, I do not
          see a driver. Yes, I am looking!
          The attendant points over Richard's shoulder to an exit.
          Richard begins to turn in Cordelia's direction, but the
          attendant corrects him, pointing the other way.

                         RICHARD
          Merci.
           He picks up Alice's suitcase and heads off just as a
          UNIFORMED DRIVER approaches Cordelia.

                         DRIVER
          Mademoiselle Scott?

                         CORDELIA
          Where have you been?
          The driver leads her away, neither she nor Richard having
          taken note of the nearby newsstand and its display of today's
          front page: Emma on the yacht wearing Cordelia's necklace.

          Meg zooms the moped around the fountain a last loop, Bernard
          on the back, before jerking to a stop in front of the hotel.
          Bernard steadies the moped as Meg climbs off.

          Goodbye, Meg.
          Meg stops, holds a beat with her back to Bernard.
          Then she turns and marches to him with purpose, seizing his
          face in both her hands and kisses him passionately.
          She releases Bernard, who staggers against the moped,
          catching himself just before going over, as she turns again
          for the steps, an enormous smile on her face.

          It's funny if you think about it.
          I could have had a prince. A real
          one. But, I wanted my Niki--
          (a big bite of apple)
          Hey. Why are you guys crying?

                         
          This is good news!

                         ALICE

          No--? What jewelry?

          Alice holds up the newspaper.

          Ooh, that's a good one!

                         ALICE
          The necklace, Emma!
          Emma's face clouds as she distractedly reaches a hand to her
          bare collar bone, then flicks her eyes up to Alice.

                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Emma, where's the necklace--?

          They look directly down to the base of the hotel where the
          trio of paparazzi call as Cordelia emerges from a limousine.
          Alice and Meg look at each other, stricken.

                         EMMA
          Oh, hey. What's she doing here?

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - LOBBY - DAY

          Cordelia strides across the lobby, passing WORKERS who set up
          for the auction, and arrives at the front desk.
          A busy DESK CLERK glances up, brightening happily.

                         

                         DESK CLERK

          Cordelia looks at him with typical, withering disdain.

          The driver was late.
          The clerk's smile falters, fades.

          The three women scramble though the suite, collecting,
          straightening, smoothing in a blind panic.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - HALLWAY - DAY

          The bellhop stops outside the door with Cordelia.

          door when they hear the key inserted from the other side.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - HALLWAY - DAY

          The bellhop opens the door, holding it wide for Cordelia who

                         
          marches in to the room...

          Of course, they've screwed this up

          The bellhop opens the bedroom doors, revealing the tower of
          Cordelia's luggage, crowned by the reassembled fruit basket.
          Cordelia, unimpressed, indicates the bags the bellhop holds.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)

          She spins away for the French doors, twisting their handles,
          and throwing them wide.

          Cordelia steps to the railing, completely unaware of Alice,
          precariously perched atop the adjacent balcony's railing,
          back pressed against the face of the hotel.

                         CORDELIA

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Stavros is supposed to be here,
          isn't he? I don't see his boat!
          Alice carefully turns to Meg and Emma who look back her with
          desperate faces from the balcony on the far side of Cordelia,
          where they balance with their shopping bags.

          BELLBOY (O.S.)

          The bellboy stands expectantly by the front door.

                         CORDELIA
          Yes?
          He nods, not quite with his hand out, but waiting.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          If you're done, you may go.
          The bellboy turns but hesitates in catching a quick glimpse
          of Alice, fleet as a gazelle, as she passes the open doors on
          the balcony behind Cordelia.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          I said, you can go.
          He bows a retreat, backing out the door.

          Alice climbs across to the next balcony where Meg tries the

          Shopping bags swing up over the edge of the roof, landing in
          profusion, followed by three sets of gripping hands.
          Alice, Meg and Emma haul each other over the hotel's crown,
          the view of the ocean and the yachts in the bay behind them.

          A BOAT DRIVER in uniform passes a captain's hat to Nikolai,

          She hangs up her cell with a sniff and raises the apple,
          stopping when she sees where Emma has eaten.
          She recoils, dropping the apple, which rolls across the
          carpet and hits one of Emma's sandals beneath the desk.
          Cordelia approaches, looking down to discover the other
          sandal in the wastebasket, along with Emma's broken plastic
           tiara, room service dishes, and the newspaper.

          Domenico and Penelope head for the ballroom entrance and
          Richard arrives at the front desk, just as the clerk's phone
          begins to ring.
          Richard holds up the newspaper with Emma's photo.

          No. Bernard, wait--
          CLICK! Meg and Bernard both turn their heads to look down
          the corridor when Cordelia sticks her head out the bedroom
          door into the hall.
          A beat as Cordelia and Meg lock eyes.
          DING! The elevator doors open at the end of the hall, closer
          to Cordelia.
          She looks back at Meg for an instant then bolts as Meg leaps
          past Bernard into the hall.

          Meg stops on a landing, turns.

          Bernard, you should stop. You

          Niki? What's going on?

          Ya das-ta-nu to-be zvyoz-dee.
          Emma nods, without any real understanding, as he indicates
          the necklace.

                         NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
          Is my gift. For you.
          Emma's eyes slowly come into focus as it all becomes
          clear-and she FAINTS.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - DAY

          Together, Alice, Meg and Emma offer an envelope fat with
          Euros to Jean-Pierre.
          They stand, with Richard, Bernard, Nikolai, Penelope and
          Domenico, beside a waiting sedan at the base of the hotel's
          steps where the trio of paparazzi shoot away. 

                         ALICE
          This is for our room. And the trip
          down.

                         MEG
          The rest is for the schools.
          Jean-Pierre hesitates in accepting the envelope, but Alice
          presses it on him.

                         ALICE
          Please.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          You are all extraordinary women.

                         (TO RICHARD)
          I wish you much happiness.

                         (SHAKING HANDS)
          Thank you.
          Meg turns to Bernard, holding up the bottle of wine, as
          Richard places Alice's suitcase in the trunk with their
          shopping bags.

          Yes.
          They embrace and Meg turns with Alice to Emma who stands arm
          in arm with Nikolai.

                         ALICE
          Now, Emma, you're sure about this?

                         EMMA
          I'll call you both as soon as I
          know. They may have to get a sub
          at school for a couple of weeks,
          but, oh, you guys, I swear it
          sounded like a proposal!
          Alice and Meg turn to Nikolai who grins and nods away.

          Yes! Yes!

          0 EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - FRONT DRIVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Jean-Pierre closes the car's door with Alice, Meg and Richard
          inside, stepping back to join Emma, Nikolai, Bernard,
          Penelope and Domenico, who watch as the car pulls out.
          Together, they wave their friends away.
          Jean-Pierre shakes hands with Nikolai and kisses Emma, tips
          his head in farewell to Bernard, then enters the hotel with
          Penelope and Domenico.
          Emma and Nikolai shake hands with Bernard, then turn and head
          for the marina, trailed by one of the paparazzi while the
          other two pause to reload their cameras.
          As Bernard hops on his moped to zip away, the revolving doors
          turn and Cordelia steps out, talking on her cellphone,
          followed by a train of bellhops and luggage.

                         CORDELIA
          Yes, Daddy! It was a huge success--
          She stops suddenly, as if struck, and her expression of
          perpetual anger melts away as she listens, blinks.

          One of the paparazzi raises his camera to take her picture,
          but another places his hand over the lens.

                         PAPARAZZI
          That's not her. That's the other
          one.

          INT. NICE AIRPORT - TERMINAL GATE - DAY

          Alice sits between Richard and Meg at the departure gate,
          each lost in their own thoughts as TRAVELERS pass to and fro.
          A long beat.
          A small smile finds its way onto Alice's face and she gently
          lowers her head to rest it on Richard's shoulder.
          Richard finds Alice's hand and squeezes it in his own.

          INT. NICE AIRPORT - JETWAY - DAY

          Meg walks down the jetway in her skinny jeans, a bounce in 
          her step, shopping bags in one hand, the bottle of wine
          gripped in the other, as though headed for a party.
          Behind her, Alice carries her shopping bags and Richard totes
          Alice's suitcase.

          ALICE (V.0.)
          "I used to wander aimlessly,/
          Wanton my goal, grievous my
          plight./Your dear hands led me,

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

          A bulletin board in Meg's classroom is covered in African
          fabric, photographs and letters, all under a banner that
          reads: Food Drive for Our Sister School - Zambia.
          The two students who had cooked their pot holders sort canned
          goods beneath the board, while Meg cooks, surrounded by the
          rest of her CLASS.

          A STUDENT carefully scoops spices with a measuring spoon,
          holding it out for Meg to add to her pan.
          She ignores the spoon, instead reaching to pinch some spice
          with her fingers and encourages the student who follows her
          example.

          Alice moves freely around the center of the circle of desks

          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is
          a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide
          corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and
          battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at
          the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are
          clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.
                         
          Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling
          the gutters.
                         
          A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully
          eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel
          slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He
          takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the
          turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.
                         
          A child's voice says over the speaker:
                         
           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
           In order to show you how a big symphony
           orchestra is put together, Benjamin
           Britten has written a big piece of music,
           which is made up of smaller pieces that
           show you all the separate parts of the
           orchestra.
                         
          As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their
          bedrooms and down to the landing.
                         
          The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is
          Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer
          shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a
          twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high
          socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is
          Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.
                         
          The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They
          lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their
          fists, listening.
                         
          Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly
          and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the
          cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her
          neck.
                         
          Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She
          raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out
          into the rain.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          A rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside
          with turrets and a widow's walk. A weather vane swings
          creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The
          sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland
          is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window,
          watching.
                         
                         TITLES OVER:
                         
          The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain.
                         
          In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They
          shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat
          grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen.
                         
          In half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a
          tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed
          glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs.
          Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly
          Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair,
          topless, in the kitchen sink.
                         
          In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet
          branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker
          fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field.
          She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry.
                         
          In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The edge of a cliff above a white beach. A rocky peninsula
          curls into the background. Brisk wind rustles the tall grass.
          A fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the
          sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a
          tripod. He wears rubber boots and a parka. He is the
          narrator. He speaks to the camera:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           This is the island of New Penzance.
           Sixteen miles long. Forested with old-
           growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by
           shallow tidal creeks. An important
           seabird habitat. There are no paved roads
           but instead many miles of intersecting
           foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry
           that runs twice daily from Stone Cove.
           The year is 1965. We are on the far edge
           of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the
           ferocious and well-documented storm which
           will strike from the east on the fifth of
           September -- in three day's time.

          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
                         
          A clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched
          in a row. A banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind. It
          reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow
          neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch
          over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye.
                         
          A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges
          through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward.
          He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown
          reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin
          scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side.
          He is Gadge.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Morning, Gadge.
                         
                          GADGE
           Morning, sir.
                         
          Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout
          Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and
          rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an
          army-shovel. He is Deluca.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Deluca. Latrine inspection.
                         
          Deluca stops digging. He pulls on a rope and water runs down
          a chute. It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and
          a small, red flag flips up. Scout Master Ward nods.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Good.
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Scout Master Ward strides away. He stops
          in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a
          stump twisting something in his fingers. He is Roosevelt.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Roosevelt. How's that lanyard coming?
                         
                          ROOSEVELT
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           I don't know. I think I skipped a stitch.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A small, woven, multi-colored cord with a rabbit's foot
          attached to the end of it. It has been braided exceedingly
          badly and is brutally twisted and misshapen.
           4.
                         
                         
          Scout Master Ward studies the lanyard briefly. He looks
          perplexed. He pats Roosevelt on the back gently and does a
          secret handshake with him. Gadge makes a note. Scout Master
          Ward strides away.
                         
          An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the
          tents. It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air,
          and revs away riding a wheelie. Scout Master Ward frowns.
                         
          Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs
          stacked six feet high. A thick-set scout with black hair and
          a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms. He is
          Skotak.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Skotak. What's all this lumber for?
                         
                          SKOTAK
                          (CHEERILY)
           We're building a tree house.
                         
          Skotak points up. Scout Master Ward squints. There is a small
          platform under construction about sixty feet above them. Two
          scouts are sawing something in half on it. Scout Master Ward
          looks astonished.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           That's not a safe altitude.
                         
          Scout Master Ward circles around the trunk while looking up
          at the tree house. He stammers:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Why's it up so high? If somebody falls --
           it's a guaranteed death.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Well, where would you've built it?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (PAUSE)
           Lower!
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Skotak looks sheepish. Scout Master Ward
          strides away. He stops in front of a very small scout with
          tiny eyes poking at an anthill with a stick. He appears to be
          contemplating pouring lighter fluid on it. He is Nickleby.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Nickleby. Spot check.
                         
          Nickleby stands up. He looks extremely disheveled.
           5.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Your socks are down. Your shirt-tails are
           untucked. Your trousers are not properly
           pressed. You are reported for uniform
           violation!
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Nickleby slouches. Scout Master Ward
          strides away. He stops in front of a work-bench covered with
          newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel
          into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a
          metal press. They are Panagle and Izod. A sign on the side of
          the table reads No Smoking. Scout Master Ward hands his
          cigarette to Gadge, who holds it away at arm's length.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           How many rockets you up to, Panagle?
                         
                          PANAGLE
           Sixteen and a half.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (TO GADGE)
           That enough for the Jubilee?
                         
          Gadge shakes his head. Scout Master Ward turns to Izod.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Izod, go fetch another pint of gun-powder
           from the armory shed.
                         
          Izod dashes around the corner. Scout Master Ward strides
          away. He shouts:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Redford! Halt!
                         
          The motorcycle skids to a stop in front of Scout Master Ward,
          engulfing him in a thick cloud of dust. He coughs and waves
          his arms in the air. As the smoke clears, we see that the
          rider is a bronze, all-American-looking boy with blond hair.
          He is Redford. His motorcycle has flames painted on the gas
          tank. He tries to cover for himself:
                         
                          REDFORD
           Safety-test, sir.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (BRISTLING)
           Come again?
                         
                          REDFORD
           The vehicle appears to be in good working
           order. I'm just checking if --
           6.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (ANGRILY)
           Reckless cycling. Second warning. Next
           time, I take away the keys.
                         
          Gadge makes a note. Redford scowls. Scout Master Ward strides
          away. He walks past a scout in a white apron cooking bacon
          over a charcoal grill. He is Chef.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Morning, Chef.
                         
          Chef rings a bell hanging on a post. Scout Master Ward
          arrives at a long picnic table. He sits down and opens a
          magazine called Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover
          of a scout troop crossing a bridge in Indonesia.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The first page. A caption across the top reads Scout Master-
          in-Chief. There is a drawing of a seventy-year-old man on
          horseback. He has silver hair and a moustache. A signature
          below reads Commander Pierce. There is a quotation in large
          text: "An eagle was never hatched from a goose's egg."
                         
          As Scout Master Ward reads, all the scouts begin to join him
          one-by-one. They range in age from twelve to fifteen. They
          unscrew the tops of tin mess-kits and assemble folding
          utensils. The chef brings a tray of scrambled eggs to the
          table. The scouts serve themselves noisily.
                         
          Scout Master Ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal
          cup -- then stops. He looks up from his magazine.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Who's missing?
                         
          Scout Master Ward silently reels off a list of names,
          scanning the troop. He turns and shouts across the camp:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Shakusky! Breakfast!
                         
          Silence. Scout Master Ward calls to Lazy-Eye:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Lazy-Eye.
                         
          Lazy-Eye plays another tattoo. Silence.
                         
          Scout Master Ward closes his magazine. He flicks his
          cigarette into a red bucket labelled Fire. He picks up a
          strip of bacon and chews on it as he rises to his feet and
          walks down the row of smaller tents. The last one is sealed
           7.
                         
                         
          at the front. Scout Master Ward stands with his hands on his
          hips and says:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Shakusky? You in there?
                         
          Scout Master Ward tugs on the tent's flaps. He frowns. He
          says to Gadge:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           It's zipped from the inside.
                         
          The other scouts begin to gather with their tin breakfast
          plates in their hands, watching curiously while they eat.
          Scout Master Ward's voice softens:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Sam?
                         
          Scout Master Ward looks concerned. He produces a wooden-
          handled scout pocket-knife. He unfolds a few blades and
          gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the
          end. He crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap
          at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up
          briskly, unzipping the tent.
                         
          INT. SCOUT TENT. DAY
                         
          The lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and
          pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. There is a foot
          locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it,
          and an empty cot. Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent
          over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot
          locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks
          up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from
          under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns
          suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides
          it aside.
                         
          There is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a
          basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. Scout
          Master Ward looks to his staring troop.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Jiminy Cricket. He flew the coop.
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
                         
          A one-room bungalow with a sign on the door that reads Island
          Police. There is a wood-panelled station wagon parked
          alongside it with roller-lights on the roof and a sheriff's
          office insignia on the door. (This is the only car on the
          island.) A dock stretches from the cottage into a small
           8.
                         
                         
          harbor. There is a launch moored at the end of it which bobs
          in the rough tide.
                         
          A silver Airstream trailer is parked under a tree nearby.
                         
          A six-foot tall, forty-five-year-old man sits on a stool
          fishing from the side of the dock. He wears a short-sleeved
          police uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap. His
          glasses have clear, plastic frames and a strap. He is Captain
          Sharp.
                         
          Two grouchy, leathery, very old men in plaid flannel and
          hunting caps fish alongside Captain Sharp. A speaker on a
          post emits an electric buzz. Captain Sharp turns. He stands
          up briskly and says to one of the old men:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Watch my line, Edgar.
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION. DAY
                         
          A small office with a desk, a file cabinet, and a two-way
          radio. Captain Sharp comes inside, sits down, grabs a
          microphone, and presses a red button on the side of it with
          his thumb.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over.
                         
          Scout Master Ward's voice comes over a crackly speaker:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           Captain Sharp, this is Randall Ward over
           at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.
                         
          Captain Sharp pours himself a cup of coffee from a pot on a
          hot-plate as he answers distractedly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Morning, Randy. What can I do for you?
           Over.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           I'm not sure, exactly. I've got an
           escaped Khaki Scout. Over.
                         
          Silence. Captain Sharp frowns slightly.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What does that mean? Over.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)

           rifle -- and disappeared. Over.
                         
          Captain Sharp slowly stirs sugar into his coffee as he
          contemplates this. He says finally:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Any idea why? Over.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           No. He left me a letter of resignation.
           Over.

           Dear Scout Master Ward, I am very sad
           to inform you I can no longer be involved
           with the Khaki Scouts of North America.
           The rest of the troop will probably be
           glad to hear this. It is not your fault.
           Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.
                         
          Captain Sharp scratches his head. He checks his watch. Pause.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I guess we better notify his folks. Over.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
           OK. Over and out.

          A clapboard cottage surrounded by a white, picket fence. A
          sign on the door reads U.S. Mail. Captain's Sharp station
          wagon is parked in the background.

          A young woman with her hair in a bun sits at an operator's
          switchboard eating a sandwich wrapped in wax-paper. She is
          Becky. She wears bulky head-phones with a microphone
          attached. Captain Sharp paces behind her. Scout Master Ward
          flips through a stack of letters and post cards.
                         
          A bell rings on the switchboard. Becky plugs cords into
          sockets.
                         
                          BECKY
           Hello, Diane.
           10.
                         
                         
           OPERATOR (V.O.)
           Becky, I have your person-to-person from
           Chesterfield.
                         
                          BECKY
           Hold the line, please.
                         
          Becky signals to Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward. They
          sit down quickly and put on their own sets of operator head-
          phones.
                         
                          BECKY
           Go ahead, Chesterfield.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
          Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a
          seventy-five-year-old man with a grizzled face sitting at a
          kitchen table drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette while a
          white-haired woman ices a cake in the background. They are
          Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. Mr. Billingsley says into his
                         TELEPHONE:
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           Hello?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp.
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank
           you very much. In fact, we've come to a
           decision, as a family, because this is
           only the most recent incident involving
           Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to
           the others, so, unfortunately -- we can't
           invite him back, at this time.
                         
          Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky all look puzzled.
          Captain Sharp says evenly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll
           find him. We're just notifying you as a
           matter of protocol and so on.
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           I understand that. I'm notifying you of
           the situation on my end.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I'm confused by that statement. You can't
           invite him back?
           11.
                         
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           I'm afraid not. He's a good boy, he's got
           a good heart, but it's just not fair to
           the others, you see? He's emotionally
           disturbed.
                         
          Long pause. No one moves except Mrs. Billingsley icing her
          cake. Captain Sharp says finally:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Am I speaking to Sam's father?
                         
          Mr. Billingsley frowns. He says, surprised:
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a
           number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs.
           Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's
           been with us since last June.
                         
          Mrs. Billingsley has stopped icing her cake. She watches Mr.
          Billingsley. Scout Master Ward interjects:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Excuse me, sir. This is Scout Master Ward
           speaking. Are you implying Sam's an
           orphan?
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           Well, it's a known fact. Of course, he
           is.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Why the hell doesn't it say that in the
           register? Excuse my language.
                         
          Scout Master Ward holds up a manila file-card. Mr.
          Billingsley shrugs.
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           I don't know. What register?
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The manila file-card. It is labelled Khaki Scout Register.
          Sam Shakusky is typed across the top line. There is an
          address, health information, and a small, faded snap-shot
          stapled to the corner of it of a twelve-year-old boy standing
          in a sunny tobacco field. He wears his scout uniform with a
          Davy Crockett-style coon-skin cap.
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           We sent him a letter. It should reach you
           presently.
           12.
                         
                         
          Scout Master Ward looks quickly through his stack of letters.
          He stops and pulls out an air-mail envelope. He stares at it.
          Captain Sharp says forcefully but highly agitated:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped
           Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a
           matter of protocol. You say you can't
           invite him back? You say he's an orphan?
           Well, I don't understand how that works.
                          (TOTALLY CONFUSED)
           What am I supposed to do with him?
                         
           MR. BILLINGSLEY
           That's up to Social Services. They'll be
           in touch with you. They'll look after
           Sam. Good luck to you.
                         
          Mr. Billingsley hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords
          out of their sockets. Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master
          Ward. Silence.
                         
          Becky opens a tin of home-made chocolate chip cookies.
          Captain Sharp declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He
          looks very impressed.
                         
          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
                         
          Scout Master Ward stands on a bench addressing his assembled
          troop. The scouts are equipped for hiking with back-packs and
          walking-sticks.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You have your orders. Use the
           orienteering and path-finding skills
           you've been practicing all summer. Let's
           find our man and bring him safely back to
           camp. Remember: this isn't just a search
           party, it's a chance to do some first-
           class scouting. Any questions?
                         
          Lazy-Eye raises his hand. Scout Master Ward points to him.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Lazy-Eye.
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           What's your real job, sir?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (CAUGHT OFF-GUARD)
           I'm a math teacher.
           13.
                         
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           What grade?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (STIFFENING)
           Eighth. Why?
                         
          Lazy-Eye shrugs. Scout Master Ward frowns.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You know, we're, actually, kind of, in
           the middle of something, if you didn't
           notice. This is a crisis. Anybody else?
                         
          Redford raises his hand. Scout Master Ward points to him.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Redford.
                         
                          REDFORD
           What if he resists?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (HESITATES)
           Who?
                         
                          REDFORD
           Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on
           him?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (IRRITATED)
           No, you're not. This is a non-violent
           rescue effort. Your instructions are to
           find him, not to hurt him. Under any
           circumstances. Do I make myself
           understood?
                         
          The scouts murmur their understanding. Scout Master Ward
          nods.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Good.
                         
          Pause. Scout Master Ward wheels back to Lazy-Eye:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           I'm going to change my answer, in fact.
           This is my real job. Scout Master, Troop
           55. That's us. I'm proud of that.
                         
          The scouts look impressed but slightly lost. Scout Master
          Ward says finally:
           14.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Be leery out there. OK, let's get
           started. Where's Snoopy?
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Right here.
                         
          Skotak holds up a leash attached to a wire-haired terrier.
          Scout Master Ward takes a sock with a fleur-de-lis on it out
          of a paper sack.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Give him the scent.
                         
          Scout Master Ward hands the sock to Skotak.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Redford, Deluca, Nickleby, Lazy-Eye, and Gadge at the back of
          the group talking under their breath while Skotak waves the
          sock under the dog's nose:
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           I heard he ran away because his family
           died.
                         
                          GADGE
           I heard he never had any family in the
           first place.
                         
                          DELUCA
           That's probably why he's crazy.
                         
                          REDFORD
           I'll tell you one thing: if we find him,
           I'm not going to be the one who forgot to
           bring a weapon.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           Me, neither.
                         
                         MONTAGE:
                         
          The troop moves in a wide line searching through a thicket of
          skinny trees. Redford carries a net and a giant tomahawk in a
          sling. Deluca has a large hunting knife tucked under his
          belt. Panagle holds a walking stick with a cluster of nails
          sticking out on the end of it. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye
          all wear bows and quivers of arrows strapped to their backs.
          The wire-haired terrier strains at the end of a leash,
          sniffing down a foot-path.
           15.
                         
                         
          Scout Master Ward speeds up the river in a small boat with an
          out-board motor. He gives orders over a walkie-talkie. Gadge
          steers.
                         
          Captain Sharp stands on the doorsteps of various big houses
          showing the snap-shot of the missing scout to: an elderly
          woman, a house-keeper, a group of children, a priest. They
          all shake their heads.
                         
          Captain Sharp drives his station wagon down a beach, through
          a field, and over a bridge.
                         
          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          Captain Sharp stands at the front door talking with Mr. and
          Mrs. Bishop. Mr. Bishop holds a glass of red wine in one hand
          and an open bottle in the other. Mrs. Bishop looks slightly
          uneasy. They both study the snap-shot.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Camp Ivanhoe? That's all the way across
           the other side of the island. You really
           think a twelve-year-old boy could row
           this far in a canoe?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Most likely not.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           (with a shrug)
           It's possible, Counsellor.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (SLIGHTLY IRRITATED)
           I disagree, Counsellor. It'd take him
           three days, at least.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I don't think so. Two days, maximum.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Be that as it may, will you let me know
           if you see anything unusual?
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of Captain Sharp from overhead as he walks
          away down the front steps. He passes Lionel, Murray, and Rudy
          on their way up the path. They wear wet bathing suits and
          towels around their shoulders. Captain Sharp pats Rudy on the
          top of his head. He dries his hand on the leg of his
           16.
                         
                         
          trousers. He gets into his station wagon, backs out of the
          driveway, circles through the woods, and drives around to a
          small dirt road a hundred yards behind the house. He stops
          the car. He gets out, sits on the hood, and lights a
          cigarette.
                         
          Suzy watches from the widow's walk with her binoculars. She
          lowers them. She looks curious. She raises them back to her
          eyes and sees:
                         
          Mrs. Bishop from overhead as she comes out the back door of
          the house carrying a basket of damp laundry. She pauses at a
          clothesline, looks left and right, then walks quickly into
          the trees. She crosses a foot-bridge and arrives at the dirt
          road. Captain Sharp stands up. They talk briefly but
          intensely. Mrs. Bishop leans against the car and stares into
          space. Captain Sharp touches her hair. Mrs. Bishop makes a
          gesture with her fingers. Captain Sharp hands her his
          cigarette. Mrs. Bishop takes a puff, hands it back, and
          strides away again through the woods. Captain Sharp gets into
          his station wagon and drives off.

          A portable night stand. There is a reel-to-reel tape recorder
          recording on it. A framed photograph next to it shows the
          Scout-Master-in-Chief posing with a troop in front of the
          Matterhorn.
                         
          INT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. NIGHT
                         
          The front flaps are tied-open, and a mosquito net is drawn. A
          hanging lantern flickers on a hook. A bugle plays a variation
          of taps in the distance. Scout Master Ward sits on a cot
          dressed in pajamas. He smokes a cigarette and drinks a glass
          of brandy while he speaks tensely into a microphone:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Scout Master's log. September second.
           First day of search party for Sam
           Shakusky. Morale is extremely low, in
           part, I suppose, because Sam is,
           unfortunately, the least popular scout in
           the troop, by a significant margin. I'm
           worried, and I'm confused. Please, let us
           find him tomorrow. Please, don't let him
           fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn
           lake or something. A terrible day at Camp
           Ivanhoe. Let's hope tomorrow's better. In
           fact, I'm going to say a prayer.
                         
          Scout Master Ward presses stop. He kneels down on the floor,
          closes his eyes, presses his palms together, and whispers.

          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. NIGHT
                         
          Scout Master Ward zips up his tent and turns off the light.
          Crickets chirp. Bats circle. The wire-haired terrier digs
          carefully through a pile of trash.
                         
          EXT. NARROW STREAM. DAY
                         
          The next morning. A fast current runs along a shallow ravine
          deep in the forest. The boy from the snap-shot rows a mini-
          canoe painted with Native American tribal symbols and
          severely over-loaded with boxes, bags, and blankets. He wears
          a pellet gun slung on a strap over his shoulder and his coon-
          skin cap. He smokes a pipe. A sash across his chest is
          decorated with numerous small, embroidered patches. There is
          a woman's enamelled brooch pinned to his shirt. It is a
          jeweled, black scorpion. He whistles to himself quietly as he
          steers under a fallen tree-trunk and winds through gentle
          rapids. He is Sam.
                         
          EXT. RIVER BANK. DAY
                         
          An eddy under a willow tree. The end of the canoe is tied to
          a branch, and the cargo is stacked on the shore. Sam covers
          the boat with a camouflage net and dresses the top with pine-
          needles.
                         
          EXT. ROCKY GORGE. DAY
                         
          Sam hikes through a pass wearing an extremely large back-pack
          with stakes, metal poles, and two bed-rolls strapped to the
          bottom. He wears a compass on a string around his neck.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of Sam emerging from the woods into a wide
          meadow. The grass comes up to his chest and flows in waves.
          He pauses to check his compass. He spins slowly one direction
          and then back the other while he stares at the dial. He looks
          up again. He walks onward. He stops.
                         
          EXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY
                         
          Suzy lowers her binoculars. She stands at the end of a path
          cut through the high grass. She has a leather folder in one
          hand, the portable record player in the other, plus a small
          suitcase and her kitten in a basket at her side. Sam takes
          his coon-skin hat slowly off his head. He strides across the
          meadow. Suzy watches him approach. She swallows. Her lips
          part. Sam comes onto the path. He stops ten feet away from
          Suzy.
                         
          Sam and Suzy stare at each other. Silence. (NOTE: Suzy is
          slightly taller than Sam.)

          A poster box with St. Jack's Church across the top. A purple-
          ink mimeographed page is stapled to a bulletin board inside
          under the heading Summer Pageant, 1964. It reads:

          Dusk. A brick church at the top of a bluff overlooking the
          bay. It is overgrown with ivy and wisteria. There is a
          cemetery with a low wrought-iron fence. An organ plays
          inside.

           One Year Earlier
                         
          INT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. EVENING
                         
          A play is in progress. The set includes a long ark with a
          sail built on a platform behind the altar. Two teenagers
          crouched in the wings ripple a narrow, blue sheet across the
          foot of the stage. (This is meant to be water.) The rest of
          the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the
          center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large
          congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the
          walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir
          loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a
          brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next
          cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised.
                         
          Khaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the
          church. A very young troop in a slightly different version of
          the uniform fills a row near the exit. Sam sits on the aisle.
          He looks bored.
                         
          A baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard
          sings ominously on the stage. Cymbals crash. Sam stands up
          and discreetly wanders toward the side door with his hands in
          his pockets. A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform
          watches him from the end of the pew, frowning.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam quietly entering the lobby. The sound of the music
          deadens as he gently shuts the door behind him. He turns
          around and puts on a yellow scout cap with Junior Khaki
          stitched on the bill. The room is jammed with children
          dressed as animals, waiting nervously in a long line that
           19.
                         
                         
          winds all around the space. They whisper and shuffle. A large
          woman stares through a small window into the church with her
          hand on a doorknob. She is Mrs. Lynn. She snaps her fingers
          suddenly without looking to the children. They fall silent.
          Pause.
                         
          Mrs. Lynn swings open the center doors. Music fills the room
          again. The first twenty of the children begin to sing. They
          march out of the lobby, two by two. The woman closes the
          doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to
          wait.
                         
          Sam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and
          skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching
          horns, tusks, and teeth. No one pays attention to him. He
          drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a
          bowl and sucks on it. He slips out through a swinging door.
                         
          INT. DRESSING ROOM. EVENING
                         
          Sam moves down a dark corridor. Voices murmur. He pokes his
          head around a corner. A rack of choir robes and cassocks
          blocks his path. He slides two of them apart and looks
                         THROUGH AT:
                         
          Five eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a
          bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. They talk
          quietly and fix their make-up. They all wear wings on their
          arms and beaks on their heads. Suzy sits among them in black
          feathers. Sam stares at her. He steps into the light
          silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection. The other girls
          turn around quickly, covering themselves.
                         
          Sam removes his cap and takes another step forward. His eyes
          dart briefly among the other girls. He says to Suzy:
                         
                          SAM
           What kind of bird are you?
                         
          Suzy hesitates. She looks to the girl next to her, who says
          in a bossy voice:
                         
                          BOSSY GIRL
           I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and --
                         
          Sam does not look away from Suzy as he interrupts, pointing:
                         
                          SAM
           No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?"
                         
          The other girls all look to Suzy. Pause.
                         
                          SUZY
           I'm a raven.
           20.
                         
                         
          Suzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead. The
          other girls look annoyed but transfixed. The bossy girl
          frowns.
                         
                          BOSSY GIRL
           Boy's aren't allowed in here.
                         
          Sam does not look away from Suzy as he answers quietly:
                         
                          SAM
           I'll be leaving soon.
                         
          Sam points down at Suzy's lap. One of her hands is wrapped in
          a bandage.
                         
                          SAM
           What happened to your hand?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (PAUSE)
           I got hit in the mirror.
                         
                          SAM
                          (TAKEN ABACK)
           Really. How'd that happen?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SHRUGS)
           I lost my temper at myself.
                         
          Sam is deeply intrigued by this. The other girls look
          puzzled. Suzy presses her hair back off her face. She watches
          Sam nervously.
                         
                          SUZY
           What's your name?
                         
                          SAM
           Sam. What's yours?
                         
                          SUZY
           I'm Suzy.
                         
          Sam nods with his eyes still glued to Suzy's. Suzy bites her
          fingernails. The bossy girl rolls her eyes.
                         
                          BOSSY GIRL
           It's not polite to stare.
                         
          Sam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking.
          Mrs. Lynn steps into the doorway.
                         
           MRS. LYNN
           Birds! Ready?
           21.
                         
                         
          Mrs. Lynn does a double-take. She snaps at Sam:
                         
           MRS. LYNN
           Who are you? Where'd you come from? Go
           back to your seat.
                         
          Sam hesitates. He spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out
          through the clothing rack, and is gone. A skinny girl dressed
          as an owl watches Suzy while the other girls hurry to their
          feet. She says quietly:
                         
                          SKINNY GIRL
           He likes you.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH YARD. EVENING
                         
          Troops flood out from one side of the church while children
          in animal costumes flood out from the other. They criss-cross
          among grave-markers and head-stones. Sam stops abruptly, face
          to face with the skinny owl. She whispers something, points
          behind her, and thrusts a folded scrap of paper into Sam's
          hand.
                         
          INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT
                         
          A vehicle crowded with scouts. Sam sits alone in the back
          row. He stares into space, entranced.

          Suzy on-stage at the top of a pedestal with her arms in the
          air, spreading her wings. She is surrounded by the entire
          cast of singing animals. The music soars.

          A sheet of pink stationary with an address in a girl's red
          felt-tip cursive and the words:

          Sam says carefully:
                         
                          SAM
           Were you followed?

           Good.
                         
          Sam frowns and squints. He points.
                         
                          SAM
           Did you bring a cat?
                         
          Suzy nods. Sam smiles. Suzy smiles. Sam takes a folded map
          out of his pocket. He signals for Suzy to come closer.
                         
                          SAM
           Can you read a map?

           Uh-huh.
                         
                          SAM
           I do cartography.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a
          protractor embroidered on it. He unfolds the map.
                         
                          SAM
           I feel we should go halfway today and
           halfway tomorrow, since you're a less
           experienced hiker, and you're wearing
           Sunday-school shoes.
                         
                          SUZY
           OK.
                         
                          SAM
           (pointing on the map)
           Here's where we are right now. I'd like
           to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred
           (which means four o'clock). How does that
           sound?
                         
                          SUZY
           Fine.
                         
                          SAM
           You want some beef jerky?
                         
                          SUZY
           OK.
                         
          Sam tears a strip of dried meat in two and gives half to
          Suzy. She tries to chew on it. Sam nods:
           23.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Let's go.
                         
                         MONTAGE:
                         
          Sam and Suzy walk together down a hill, across a field, and
          through a wooded path eating beef jerky. They both smile
          continuously.
                         
                          SAM
           Are you thirsty?
                         
                          SUZY
           No.
                         
                          SAM
           Well, if your throat gets parched, stick
           a pebble in your mouth and suck on it.
           You can quench your thirst with the spit,
           supposedly.
                         
          Sam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out
          from under his coonskin cap.
                         
                          SAM
           Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It
           cools your head down.
                         
                          SUZY
           That's a good idea. It might help also if
           you didn't wear fur.
                         
                          SAM
                          (HESITATES)
           True, but this adds camouflage.
                         
          Sam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass. He
          holds it in his fist.
                         
                          SAM
           Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air,
           and you can see which direction the
           wind's blowing.
                         
          Sam throws up the grass. It swirls and drifts vaguely. Suzy
          squints.
                         
                          SUZY
           Which way?
                         
                          SAM
           Unknown. I guess it doesn't really
           matter, as long as we cover our tracks.
           24.
                         
                         
          Sam and Suzy stop to investigate and discuss: a patch of
          mushrooms, moss on a stump, ferns, poison ivy, and a low bush
          with purple fruit. Sam looks skeptical.
                         
                          SAM
           These might be poisonous.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (STUDYING THEM)
           No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try
           one.
                         
          Suzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry. Sam puts one
          into his mouth and nods.
                         
                          SAM
           Not bad. Anyway, they're good for
           survival.
                         
          Sam and Suzy look through Suzy's binoculars at a deer
          drinking from a stream. Suzy whispers:
                         
                          SUZY
           He knows someone's watching him.
                         
                          SAM
           I agree. Why do you say that?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SQUINTING)
           I don't know. I just think he can feel
           us.
                         
          Sam and Suzy walk across a fallen tree over a stream. A snake
          swims on the surface below them. Sam assists Suzy onto the
          far bank.
                         
                          SAM
           You smell like perfume.
                         
                          SUZY
           It's my mother's.
                         
          Sam picks up two pebbles. He and Suzy both put them in their
          mouths. They click against their teeth.
                         
                          SAM
           I brought water, too.
                         
          Sam and Suzy watch a small, green worm wriggling in the air,
          swaying from a silk thread. They stare, wide-eyed. Suzy cups
          her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a
          circle. Sam shrugs.
           25.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Should we catch him?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (HESITATES)
           What for?
                         
                          SAM
           Trout bait. We need worms.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SHARPLY)
           No.
                         
          Pause. The worm curls and uncurls itself gently. Sam nods.
                         
                          SAM
           You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe
           I've got a licorice whip.
                         
          EXT. LAKE SHORE. DAY
                         
          The banks of a large pond. All of Sam's and Suzy's bags,
          boxes, and suitcases are arranged around a small tent
          decorated with more tribal symbols. The kitten is asleep. Sam
          and Suzy stand at the water's edge as he removes the
          camouflage net from the canoe and says gravely:
                         
                          SAM
           How strong of a swimmer are you?
                         
                          SUZY
           Pretty good. I broke our school record
           for the back-stroke.
                         
                          SAM
                          (MILDLY SURPRISED)
           OK. Well, I'm not that strong of a
           swimmer, so I wear a life-preserver. I
           think it's a good policy to get in the
           habit, anyway.
                         
                          SUZY
           OK.
                         
          Sam and Suzy both strap on vests belted with cork blocks.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A strip of bright red licorice on a hook under water.
                         
                         CUT TO:
           26.
                         
                         
          Sam and Suzy in the middle of the lake. Suzy sits at one end
          of the canoe fishing with a bamboo pole. Sam drapes his
          fingers off the side and stirs the water.
                         
                          SAM
           Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you,
           if you put your fingers in their mouths.
           Let me see if I can catch this one.
                         
          Sam dips a net into the lake and brings it up with a small
          turtle in it. He lifts it out of the net. It has red and
          yellow markings and a slightly damaged shell. Sam flips it
          over. The word Albert is written on the underside of the
          turtle in magic marker. Sam says blankly:
                         
                          SAM
           Somebody wrote on him.
                         
          The fishing pole jerks in Suzy's hands. She yells:
                         
                          SUZY
           The stick's moving!
                         
                          SAM
                          (ALERTED)
           You got one!
                         
          Sam jumps to his feet and heaves the turtle with two hands.
          It sails through the air across the pond and splashes down
          with a whack. Sam yells an announcement:
                         
                          SAM
           Fish on hook!
                          (TO SUZY)
           Reel him in! Slowly.
                         
          The canoe rocks violently. Suzy snaps:
                         
                          SUZY
           Sit down!
                         
          Sam sits back down. Suzy winds the reel carefully. Sam says,
                         GENTLY ENCOURAGING:
                         
                          SAM
           You're doing good.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a rod
          and reel embroidered on it.
                         
                          SAM
           This is for fishing.
           27.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE SHORE. DUSK
                         
          Sam twists a stick with a shoelace in kindling and builds a
          small camp-fire circled with rocks. He cooks two fish with
          bologna in a frying pan over a camp-fire. He throws in a dash
          of salt, grinds some pepper, and flips the fish in the air.
          He holds out a bite on a spatula to Suzy sitting on a log
          next to him. She tastes it. She looks surprised and nods
                         ENTHUSIASTICALLY:
                         
                          SUZY
           Very good. You know a lot about camping,
           don't you?
                         
                          SAM
                          (STIFFENING)
           I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained
           for.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has fried
          eggs and bacon on it.
                         
                          SAM
           Anyway, I used to be.
                         
          Sam serves the fish onto two tin plates. He says as they eat
          with folding forks:
                         
                          SAM
           We can feed your cat the guts and
           eyeballs.
                         
          Sam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of
          newspaper. Suzy frowns.
                         
                          SUZY
           That's OK. He only eats cat food.
                         
          Suzy points to a cardboard box. Sam looks inside. It is
          filled with ten cans of cat food. Sam raises an eyebrow.
                         
                          SAM
           What else did you bring? We should make
           an inventory.
                         
                          SUZY
           OK.
                         
          Sam flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book.
                         
                          SAM
           Go ahead.
           28.
                         
                         
          Suzy opens the top of her portable record player. She
          displays it like a salesman.
                         
                          SUZY
           This is my record player. It works with
           batteries. Actually, it belongs to my
           little brother Lionel. I left him a note.
           Do you like music?
                         
          Sam nods and makes a note. Suzy opens her leather folder.
          There are three L.P. records in it. She takes out one by a
          French singer.
                         
                          SUZY
           This is my favorite record album. My
           godmother gave it to me for my birthday.
           She lives in France.
                         
          Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy opens her suitcase. It
          is filled to the brim with hard-back copies of fantasy books.
          It contains no other items of any kind (including clothing).
                         
                          SUZY
           These are my books. I like stories with
           magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms
           on earth or on foreign planets. Also,
           time-travel, if they make it realistic.
           Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not
           always. I couldn't bring all of them
           because it got too heavy. You can borrow
           any you want.
                         
          Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy produces a few more
                         ITEMS:
                         
                          SUZY
           I also brought my lefty scissors because
           I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some
           rubber bands, extra batteries, and my
           binoculars, as you know. I forgot my
           comb.
                         
          Sam surveys the entire collection of articles. He scratches
          his head.
                         
                          SAM
           That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No
           canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't
           you get the packing list I sent you in my
           last letter?
           29.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
                          (FROWNS)
           I thought that's what you're supposed to
           bring. I don't own a canteen.
                         
          Pause. Sam shrugs. He smiles.
                         
                          SAM
           That's OK. We can share.
                         
          Sam picks up one of the books. It is called The Girl from
          Jupiter. There is an illustration on the cover of a young,
          alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks. Sam
          examines the other books in the suitcase. He looks slightly
          puzzled.
                         
                          SAM
           These are all library books. In my school
           you're only allowed to check-out one at a
           time. Some of these are going to be
           overdue.
                         
          Sam hesitates. He suddenly realizes something. He asks
                         BLUNTLY:
                         
                          SAM
           Do you steal?
                         
          Silence. Suzy nods reluctantly. Sam looks confused.
                         
                          SAM
           Why? You're not poor.
                         
          Suzy stares at the books. She absently brushes some dust off
          them. She rearranges them slightly. She says finally:
                         
                          SUZY
           I might turn some of them back in one
           day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's
           bad. I think I just took them to have a
           secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason,
           it makes me feel in a better mood
           sometimes.
                         
          Sam thinks about this. He leans his chin against his fist. He
                         SAYS SERIOUSLY:
                         
                          SAM
           Are you depressed?
                         
          Suzy bites her fingernails. She shrugs.
                         
                          SAM
           How come?
           30.
                         
                         
          Pause. Suzy says philosophically:
                         
                          SUZY
           Well, I can show you an example, if you
           want -- but it doesn't make me feel very
           good. I found this on top of our
           refrigerator.
                         
          Suzy looks into her leather folder and shuffles through some
          pages. She withdraws a small pamphlet.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The cover of the pamphlet. There is a drawing of a broken tea-
          cup and the title "Coping with the Very Troubled Child".
                         
          Sam frowns. His eyes widen.
                         
                          SAM
           Does that mean you?
                         
          Suzy nods. Sam explodes with laughter.
                         
                          SUZY
           It's not funny.
                         
                          SAM
           To me, it is.
                         
          Sam slaps his knee and shakes his head. Pause. Suzy dumps her
          fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a
          frisbee into a tree trunk. It bounces off with a ding. She
          stands up and says coolly:
                         
                          SUZY
           You really know how to make friends.
                         
          Suzy walks away. She goes behind a bush and sits down on a
          rock. She starts to cry. Sam looks stricken and confused. He
          is very still. He gets up slowly. He tentatively approaches
          the bush. He looks behind it. He takes two steps closer. He
          stands above Suzy. He unties his neckerchief, crouches down,
          and holds it out.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Suzy looks to Sam. She hesitates. She takes the neckerchief.
                         
                          SUZY
           That's OK.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm on your side.
           31.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           I know.
                         
          Suzy dries her eyes. She unfolds the neckerchief and studies
          its design. It is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off
          the side of a galloping horse. Sam motions to the books:
                         
                          SAM
           Which one's the best?
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Dusk. Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his
          pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads
          aloud from a book called The Francine Odyssies. There is an
          illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a
          bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown.
                         
                          SUZY
           His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins,
           Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the
           rippling surface of the cool shallows and
           down to its stone floor. "My people once
           were lead by a great and noble beast --
           and I no longer see his face in this
           reflection."
                         
          Suzy looks to Sam. He is asleep. She takes the pipe out of
          his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp-fire. She draws a
          blanket over his chest. She continues:
                         
                          SUZY
           Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha,
           Francine rested. There would be another
           time for war.
                         
          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          The dining room. There is a long, wide, empty table with
          sixteen chairs around it. Tucked in the corner, Lionel,
          Murray, and Rudy sit at a folding card table. They have
          plates on place-mats and forks and knives. There is one extra
          seat. Mrs. Bishop's voice booms, amplified, from the next
                         ROOM:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Suzy! Dinner! I'm not going to say it
           again!
                         
          Pause. Mrs. Bishop charges into the room with a steaming
          casserole. She wears an oven mitt on one hand and carries an
          electric megaphone in the other. She sets the casserole on
          the card table and looks out the window. Through the thicket
           32.
                         
                         
          of trees behind the house, a pair of headlights blinks. Mrs.
          Bishop checks her watch. She says sharply:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Where's your sister?
                         
                          LIONEL
           I don't know, but she borrowed my record
           player for ten days without asking.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (CONFUSED)
           What does that mean?
                         
          Lionel holds up a small, folded-up piece of pink stationary.
          Mrs. Bishop snaps it out of his hand and opens it.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A short note on pink stationary in a girl's red felt-tip
          cursive. It reads:
                         
           Dear Lionel, I need to use your
           record player. I will give it back in
           ten days or less. Do not tell Mom.
           (Or Dad.) I will replace the batteries
           when I return. Signed, Suzy Bishop
                         
          Mrs. Bishop frowns. She bolts back out of the room. Her voice
                         BOOMS AGAIN:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Walt! Where the hell are you?
                         
          There is a loud thump upstairs. Mr. Bishop shouts from
                         OUTSIDE:
                         
           MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Right here! Why are you cursing at me?
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Exterior. Mr. Bishop leans out of an upstairs window. Mrs.
          Bishop appears in one below. She yells up through the
                         MEGAPHONE:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Does it concern you that your daughter's
           just run away from home?
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (PAUSE)
           That's a loaded question.
           33.
                         
                         
          Mrs. Bishop brandishes the note with her free hand.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Come down and read this.
                         
          A radio squawks in the woods behind the house. Mr. and Mrs.
          Bishop turn quickly toward the sound. Mrs. Bishop looks
          tense. Becky's garbled voice says over a tinny speaker:
                         
           BECKY (V.O.)
           Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no
           luck. They're going home for the --
                         
          There is a rustling and the sound of a car door opening --
          then the radio cuts off. Mr. Bishop frowns. He shouts:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Who's there?
                         
          Captain Sharp emerges slowly from the dark, tangled in a
          bramble, hopping slowly on one foot as he unwinds a root from
          around his ankle. He smiles awkwardly and says:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was
                          JUST --
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (ANGRILY)
           What are you doing here? Nobody called
           the police.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I know, that's what I'm saying. The
           search party's not over yet. In other
                          WORDS --
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Suzy's missing, too! Go find her.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (HESITATES)
           OK. Where'd she --
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Wait for me.
                         
          Mr. Bishop disappears into the house. Captain Sharp and Mrs.
          Bishop exchange an uncertain look.
                         
          INT. STATION WAGON. NIGHT
                         
          Captain Sharp pans a spot-light back and forth in the
          darkness while he steers the car. The lamp has a short in it
           34.
                         
                         
          and flickers with each bump. Mr. Bishop rides in the
          passenger seat. He stares ahead down the road and says to
                         HIMSELF:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           How can we help her? She's got so many
           problems. It's getting worse.
                         
          Mr. Bishop looks strangely to Captain Sharp. He asks:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Whose fault is it?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (HESITATES)
           I don't know, but just for the record:
           ninety-five percent of all runaways
           return home within six hours. That
           doesn't do you any good right now. It's
           just a statistic -- but in all likelihood
           Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at
           her best friend's house playing Chinese
           Checkers at this very moment, as we
           speak.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           She doesn't have any friends.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (LONG PAUSE)
           How's Laura?
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (IRRITATED)
           How's Laura?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Mrs. Bishop, I mean.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           I don't understand.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Is she upset?
                         
          Mr. Bishop looks baffled and disgusted. He throws his hands
          into the air. He looks away and shakes his head. Silence.
          Captain Sharp wiggles some wires.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I got to get this spot-light fixed.

          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          Captain Sharp and Mr. Bishop come to a stop and get out of
          the station wagon. They look dejected. The screen door bangs
          open, and Mrs. Bishop quickly descends the front steps with a
          open shoebox full of letters in her hands. She says
          breathlessly, shouting:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           She has a pen pal! It's very intimate!
           They planned this together!
                         
          Captain Sharp takes one of the letters and studies it. He
          says to himself:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Sam Shakusky. That's my escaped Khaki
           Scout. His family died.
                         
          Mr. Bishop takes a handful of the letters and flips through
          them. He stops suddenly. He looks horrified.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Holy Christ. What am I looking at?
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A small painting on construction paper of a naked girl
          stepping into a bathtub. She wears a flower in her hair.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop continues to shout as she explains:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           He does watercolors! Mostly landscapes,
           but a few nudes!
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy watch from a downstairs window.
          Lionel takes a bite from a bowl of melting ice cream. Mr.
          Bishop stares at the painting. He squints at it and asks
                         INCREDULOUSLY:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           She sit for this?
                         
          Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look over Mr. Bishop's
          shoulder. Captain Sharp says calmly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What does he say?

          Sam, dressed in a greasy jump-suit, writes at a work bench in
          a garage while six teenagers take apart carburetors behind
          him. They are his foster brothers. Sam reads in voice-over:
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, You have a superb voice. You
           were my favorite animal in the program,
           by far. Please, find enclosed --
                         
          Suzy writes at a small desk on the upstairs landing while
          Lionel and Murray play a loud duet on a red piano behind her.
          (Rudy turns the pages of the sheet music.) Suzy reads in
                         VOICE-OVER:
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, Thank you very much. I got
           replaced as the raven because I yelled at
           Mrs. Lynn. After that I was only a blue
           jay, but --
                         
          Sam works in an alley emptying garbage from several small
          trash cans into a larger one. Mr. Billingsley watches
          television in a window, smoking a cigarette. He points to a
          crumpled wrapper on the ground. Sam picks it up.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, I am sorry your brothers are
           so selfish. Maybe they will grow out of
           it. Sometimes people do things without
           knowing the reasons for --
                         
          Suzy reads a book called Disappearance of the 6th Grade.
          There is an illustration on the cover of a school-teacher
          levitating at the front of her classroom. There are several
          watercolor pictures taped to the wall behind her. Most are
          landscapes of small-town vacant lots. One is a swimming girl
          in a bikini.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, You are an excellent painter,
           especially trees and telephone poles. Is
           the girl in the water supposed to be me?
           My favorite color is --
                         
          Sam stands in pajamas staring blankly, eyes wide, at a dog
          house in flames next to a rusty swing-set. A dachsund sits
          next to him, also watching. Mrs. Billingsley comes running
          out of the house with a fire extinguisher.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a fire
           while I was sleep-walking. I have no
           memory of this, but my foster parents
           think I am lying. Unfortunately, it is --
           37.
                         
                         
          Suzy stands in the kitchen looking out through a pane of
          glass with a hole smashed in the middle of it. Mrs. Bishop is
          next to her with her hair hanging over the sink while the two
          of them carefully pick bits of glass out of it.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, I am in trouble again because I
           threw a rock through the window. My mother
           still has glass in her hair. Also --
                         
          Five of Sam's foster brothers watch calmly as the sixth
          throws Sam against the wall then jumps on top of him, pinning
          his arms to the floor while Sam struggles crazily.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, I have been trying very hard
           to make friends, but I feel people do not
           like my personality. In fact, I can
           understand why they might --
                         
          A classroom of sixth graders watches in a panic as Suzy
          throttles one of her classmates. The classmate flails and
          grimaces as she is strangled.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, Now I am getting suspended
           because I got in a fight with Molly. She
           says I go berserk. Our principal is
           against me. Why do --
                         
          Sam does sit-ups on a hard mattress in a basement room lined
          with bunks. He counts out the repetitions under his breath.
          There is a small, black and white photograph of a man and
          woman at their wedding tacked to the wall above him.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your
           feelings, but they still love you. That
           is more important. If they --
                         
          Suzy stands in a doorway screaming at her family while they
          watch wearily from the dinner table with forks and knives in
          their hands.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)
           Dear Sam, I do think you should think of
           their faces every day, even if it makes
           you sad. It is too bad they did not leave
           you more pictures of themselves. Can you --

          Khaki Scout flashlight pointed at his paper.

           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, Here is my plan.
                         
          Suzy writes in her bed crouched beneath a quilt with a
          plastic lantern glowing beside her.
                         
           SUZY (V.O.)

          Suzy kneeling in the dark, crouched in front of an upper
          window with the shoebox of letters beside her. Outside, the

           SAM (V.O.)
           Dear Suzy, Walk four hundred yards due
           north from your house to the dirt path
           which has not got any name on it. Turn
           right and follow to the end.
                         
          Suzy raises her binoculars to her eyes.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           I will meet you in the meadow.
                         
          EXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY
                         
          The next morning. The end of the path cut through the high
          grass where Sam and Suzy met the day before. Captain Sharp,
          Scout Master Ward, Mrs. Bishop, and Becky stand in two groups
          talking. Gadge and Skotak stretch a string with ribbons tied
          to it from stake to stake marking a perimeter. Lazy-Eye walks
          with the wire-haired terrier pulling at its leash. Other
          scouts search the field and scan the horizon.
                         
          Captain Sharp's station wagon and Redford's motorcycle are
          parked in the dirt.
           39.
                         
                         
          Mr. Bishop stands off to the side by himself poking at the
          ground with a stick. He has two black eyes, and half his face
          is swollen and purple. Scout Master Ward asks Becky quietly:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           What happened to him?
                         
                          BECKY
           I'm not sure. I think he went searching
           in the dark.
                         
          Mr. Bishop says loudly without looking up from the ground:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           She stole the batteries out of my
           flashlight.
                         
          Scout Master Ward looks at Becky and grimaces. Becky raises
          an eyebrow. Mrs. Bishop stands next to Captain Sharp. They
          move slightly away from the others. Captain Sharp whispers
          quickly, almost inaudibly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I think he's onto us.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (INSTANTLY)
           Of course, he is.
                         
          Captain Sharp looks surprised and defensive. He whispers
                         BACK:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Of course, he is?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Of course, he is.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (CONFUSED)
           Why aren't we worried about that, then?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I am.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (ASTONISHED)
           Well, I didn't know. Or, anyway, I
           thought I was wrong. Did you hit him?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           No. He fell in a ditch.
           40.
                         
                         
          Nickleby pops up from below the tall grass and thrusts an
          empty can of cat food into the air. He shouts excitedly:
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           Cat food! I think it's a clue.
                         
          The group quickly gathers around Nickleby. Mr. Bishop
          snatches the can out of his hand and examines it. He says
                         BLANKLY:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           That's her.
                         
          Mr. Bishop throws the can away over his shoulder and walks
          off with his hands in his pockets. Nickleby runs after the
          can and picks it up again. Mr. Bishop continues down the
          hill. Scout Master Ward watches him. He asks Mrs. Bishop,
                         UNEASY:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Where's he going?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I don't know.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop follows Mr. Bishop. Captain Sharp turns to the
          rest of the group and says briskly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           All right. We know they're together. We
           know they're within a certain radius of
           this spot. I'm declaring the case with
           the county right now. Until help arrives:
                         
          Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward as he points to
          various scouts and divides the group into teams:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny
           one, and the kid with the curly hair to
           come with me in the station wagon. Randy,
           you drop-in and head up-river with the
           rest of your troop, then split-up on
           foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to
           circle over this end of the island and
           fly low.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of the seaplane flying in a pattern. It
          banks sharply. The binocular shot tilts down. Far below, in
          the distance, Captain Sharp's station wagon rumbles along a
          dirt road through the woods. The binocular shot pans wide. On
          the side of the river, Scout Master Ward's motorboat stops.

          Suzy watches through her binoculars while Sam crouches beside
          her. They are hidden behind a pile of rocks. Suzy says
                         OMINOUSLY:
                         
                          SUZY
           They found the canoe.
                         
                          SAM
           (angry at himself)
           Rats! I should've put more pine needles
           on it. Let's go. We're almost there.
                         
          Sam lifts his backpack onto his back and slings his air-rifle
          over his arm. Suzy picks up her suitcases and puts the kitten
          on her shoulder. They walk down a narrow path through a
          thicket. They emerge into a small clearing.
                         
          Sam and Suzy stop in their tracks.
                         
          Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and Lazy-Eye stand in a row
          along the edge of the woods ahead of them. Deluca brandishes
          his hunting knife. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye point their
          bows and arrows. Panagle holds his walking stick weapon. The
          wire-haired terrier strains growling at the end of his leash.
          Deluca jerks him back. The kitten cowers. The sound of a
          motorcycle guns, and Redford bursts through the trees, pops a
          wheelie, and skids to a stop. He lifts his goggles.
                         
          The motor idles. Sam says finally:
                         
                          SAM
           What do you creeps want?
                         
          Redford shrugs and answers with a callous smile:
                         
                          REDFORD
           We're looking for you.
                         
                          SAM
           Why?
                         
                          REDFORD
           Because you're a fugitive.
                         
                          SAM
           No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of
           resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts.
           42.
                         
                         
                          REDFORD
           You're still in uniform.
                         
          Pause. Sam quickly takes off his shirt and throws it aside.
                         
                          REDFORD
           Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. You
           don't have that authority. We've been
           deputized. Now are you going to come
           along peacefully or not?
                         
          Sam takes a deep breath. He pleads:
                         
                          SAM
           Listen to some reason: I don't like you.
           You don't like me. Why don't you stupid
           idiots just let us disappear?
                         
                          REDFORD
                          (PAUSE)
           It's tempting, but I can't allow it.
                         
          Deluca spits on the ground. He says to Suzy:
                         
                          DELUCA
           You shouldn't be friends with him.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (OFFENDED)
           Why not?
                         
                          DELUCA
           Because he's crazy.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (COLDLY)
           Maybe you just don't know him.
                         
                          REDFORD
           We know him a lot better than you. He's
           emotionally disturbed because his family
           died. Nickleby, tie him up.
                         
          Nickleby takes a step forward with his bow and arrow pointed
          and ready. Suzy looks furious. Sam flips his air-rifle off
          his shoulder with a twirl. He points it at Redford and
          Nickleby. Nickleby hesitates. Sam says darkly:
                         
                          SAM
           Do not cross this stick.
                         
          Sam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him. Silence.
           43.
                         
                         
                          REDFORD
           You're doomed, Shakusky.
                         
          Redford revs the motor, pops the clutch, and races across the
          clearing toward Sam and Suzy. The rest of the troop
          converges, yelling crazily.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The wide canyon echoing with shouts, screams, and a small
          explosion. One by one, Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and
          Lazy-Eye come running out of the trees and down the hill.
          Finally, Redford hobbles after them, limping and groaning and
          clutching his side.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Redford's charred, partially demolished motorcycle smoldering
          in the branches of a tree.
                         
          Suzy stands on the edge of the ravine staring at the pair of
          bloody scissors in her hand. She looks shaken. Sam takes the
          scissors, cleans them with his fingers, and hands them back
          to Suzy. He says gently:
                         
                          SAM
           It was him or us.
                         
          Suzy nods. She turns slowly away. Her eyes widen.
                         
                          SUZY
           Oh, no.
                         
          Suzy points. The wire-haired terrier lies on his back on the
          ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder
          blades. The kitten licks at the wound. Sam and Suzy run over
          to the wounded dog. Sam crouches down, gently presses the
          kitten away, and says bleakly:
                         
                          SAM
           They got Snoopy through the neck.
                         
          Suzy has tears in her eyes. She slides her hands under the
          wire-haired terrier's body. She begins to hyperventilate as
                         SHE SAYS:
                         
                          SUZY
           He needs a doctor.
                         
          Sam puts his finger to the wire-haired terrier's neck. He
                         SAYS SADLY:
                         
                          SAM
           No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue.
           44.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           (trying to catch her breath)
           He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go?
                         
          Suzy lifts the bleeding dog into her arms. Sam grabs her by
          the shoulders. He locks eyes with her and says with grit and
                         MELODRAMA:
                         
                          SAM
           Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to
           make it.
                         
                          SUZY
           (starting to cry)
           Don't say that.
                         
                          SAM
           They're after us. We got to move.
                         
                          SUZY
           (raising her voice)
           He's dying! We can't just leave him!
                         
                          SAM
                          (SHOUTING)
           It's too late! He's already gone!
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SCREAMING)
           Stop yelling at me!
                         
          Sam slaps Suzy in the face. She falls silent. He says slowly:
                         
                          SAM
           I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're
           panicking. The first rule in any
           emergency is you never --
                         
          Suzy drops the wire-haired terrier which hits the ground with
          a thud. She slaps Sam back with a huge, roundhouse smack. Sam
          falls over sideways. Suzy stands over him.
                         
                          SUZY
           Don't ever do that again. No one's
           allowed to slap me.
                         
          Sam stands up and dusts himself off. He and Suzy stare down
          at the lifeless animal. Suzy says quietly:
                         
                          SUZY
           You're right. He's dead.
                         
          Sam reaches into a side-picket of his back-pack and takes out
          an army-shovel. He assembles it. Suzy says hopefully:
           45.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Was he a good dog?
                         
          Pause. Sam shrugs. He says distantly, even cosmically:
                         
                          SAM
           Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to
           die.
                         
          Suzy slowly wraps her arm around Sam's shoulder. They squeeze
          each other tightly. Sam sighs. He begins to dig.
                         
          INT. STATION WAGON. DAY
                         
          Captain Sharp speeds bouncing down a winding dirt road. Lazy-
          Eye, Deluca, and Gadge sit next to him crowded into the
          passenger seat. Lazy-Eye yells into the hand-set of the
                         POLICE RADIO:
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           She stabbed Redford in the back with
           lefty scissors!
                         
          A voice responds over the speaker:
                         
           JED (V.O.)
           Repeat that, please? Over.
                         
          Captain Sharp grabs the hand-set out of Lazy-Eye's hand. He
          shouts into it:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room
           for a stretcher in the cockpit!
                         
          Redford is lying on his stomach on a towel in the rear of the
          vehicle. Scout Master Ward kneels next to him pressing his
          hand firmly into the middle of his back. There is significant
          blood. Redford moans loudly. Scout Master Ward reassures him:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You're going to be OK. Thank goodness,
           she missed the artery. Bite on this.
                         
          Scout Master Ward puts a pencil in Redford's teeth. Redford
          grimaces, crunching it. In the back seat, the rest of the
          troop excitedly re-cap:
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           I tried to chop him, but he dodged my
           tomahawk.
                         
                          PANAGLE
           Who else got hit?
           46.
                         
                         
                          IZOD
           Not me. I ran away when the girl went
           berserk.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           He's got great marksmanship. He shot
           Deluca in both arms.
                         
          Skotak points to the front seat. Deluca sits glumly in
          silence. He has numerous small welts all over his arms. Gadge
                         SAYS SUDDENLY:
                         
                          GADGE
           Where's Snoopy?
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
                         
          Captain Sharp's station wagon skids to a stop next to his
          office while the seaplane pulls up to the dock as Mr. and
          Mrs. Bishop approach pedalling furiously on bicycles. Mr.
          Bishop wears boating shoes. Captain Sharp and Scout Master
          Ward jump out of the car. Skotak and Gadge help them remove
          Redford on a stretcher from the back of the station wagon.
          Mr. Bishop struggles with his kick-stand. He shouts:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           What happened? Who's that? Why's he
           bleeding?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Clear the dock, Edgar!
                         
          Captain Sharp motions for the two old fishermen to get out of
          the way. He and Scout Master Ward run with the stretcher onto
          the dock. Mrs. Bishop is frantic:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Is Suzy with you?
                         
                          GADGE
           No, she's in the woods with Shakusky.
                         
          Gadge points toward the hills. A man wearing a jumpsuit and
          aviator sunglasses stands next to the seaplane. He is Jed. He
          shouts as the stretcher approaches:
                         
                          JED
           Where'm I going?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be
           right behind you.
           47.
                         
                         
          Captain Sharp motions for Skotak, Gadge, and Lazy-eye to help
          Jed load the stretcher into the small cockpit. He tosses a
          set of keys to Scout Master Ward and says:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Warm up the motor. I'll be right back.
                         
          Scout Master Ward takes the keys and starts untying the
          police launch. Captain Sharp heads toward his office. Mr.
          Bishop says firmly:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Hold it right there. You're not leaving
           this island. Our daughter's been abducted
           by one these beige lunatics.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Walt, it's very clear: the two of them
           conspired in this together.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Don't worry, Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.
           Sam's got excellent wilderness skills.
                         
          Mr. Bishop wheels on Scout Master Ward. He explodes:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Why can't you control your scouts?
                         
          Scout Master Ward recoils. He says quietly, troubled:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           I'm trying.
                         
          Mr. Bishop takes off his shoe and throws it at Scout Master
          Ward. Scout Master Ward ducks, and the shoe bounces off his
          back. Captain Sharp blocks Mr. Bishop.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Stop.
                         
          Mr. Bishop scuffles with Captain Sharp. Mrs. Bishop jerks him
          backwards and shouts:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Stop it, Walt!
                         
          Mr. Bishop faces Mrs. Bishop and Captain Sharp, breathing
          heavily. Scout Master Ward looks depressed. Jed, Gadge,
          Skotak, and Redford watch frozen from a gangplank alongside
          the seaplane.
           48.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I do blame him --
           (pointing to Scout Master Ward)
           -- but I also blame myself and both of
           you. With all due respect: you can't let
           your children stab people.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (HESITATES)
           What are you talking about?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           She's violent, Mrs. Bishop. Look.
                         
          Scout Master Ward shows Mrs. Bishop the blood all over his
          hands and uniform. Mrs. Bishop looks confused.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I don't get it. Were there witnesses?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Of course. It's assault.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I beg your pardon. Are you a lawyer?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           No, ma'am, but --
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (FURIOUS)
           Well, I am!
                         
          Captain Sharp gently draws Mrs. Bishop away by the shoulder.
          He links arms with her as he tries to placate the group:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Easy does it. Calm down, Laura.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Stay away from my wife.
                         
          Mr. Bishop pushes Captain Sharp away from Mrs. Bishop into
          Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward lunges at Mr. Bishop but
          is intercepted by Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop. They shout
                         REPEATEDLY:
                         
           CAPTAIN SHARP/MR. BISHOP SCOUT MASTER WARD/MRS. BISHOP
          Dammit! Christ! Shit! Jesus!
                         
          At this moment, a voice interjects from the shore:
           49.
                         
                         
           NARRATOR (O.S.)
           Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, Captain
           Sharp?
                         
          Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Mr. and Mrs. Bishop
          stop fighting and turn around at once. They see: the
          narrator. He stands at the foot of the dock holding a journal
          with rubber bands wrapped around it. They all stare at him
          blankly. He continues:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           As some of you know, I taught Sam for the
           cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a
           smart boy, and he expressed a keen
           interest in the history of the island's
           indigenous peoples. In particular, I
           recall his fascination with the idea of
           retracing the original path of the old
           Chickchaw harvest migration.
                         
          Long pause. Everyone looks utterly perplexed. The propeller
          of the seaplane starts up, and they all shield their eyes
          from the blast of wind and dust. The narrator hesitates. He
          yells over the noise:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           What I'm getting at is this: I think I
           know where they're going.
                         
          The narrator removes the rubber bands from his journal.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A carefully hand-drafted nautical chart. A cove is marked
          with a red arrow and the caption Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The portable record player. Suzy's fingers place the needle
          onto a spinning disc.
                         
          EXT. TIDAL LAGOON. DAY
                         
          A small cove enclosed by a low, rocky cliff. It forms an
          almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines, flowers,
          and branches. A thin channel leads out to the ocean. The sand
          on the shore is white, and the water is perfectly clear and
          crowded with shells at the bottom. Birds echo and fly from
          tree to tree.
                         
          Sam's and Suzy's luggage is piled on the beach. The kitten
          wanders, exploring. The lid of the portable record player is
          open. The voice of Leonard Bernstein says over the speaker:
           50.
                         
                         
           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
           Onto the bird-house, where every kind of
           bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling
           around. This is a real acrobatic act for
           our gifted young flute player, Paula
           Robeson.
                         
          As they listen, Sam and Suzy take off their shoes and socks
          and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove.
          They each climb up a rock over the water. They look at each
          other across the lagoon. They both laugh. Suzy shouts,
                         SMILING:
                         
                          SUZY
           This is weird.
                         
                          SAM
           I know!
                         
          Sam takes off his coon-skin cap and throws it aside. Suzy
          removes her cardigan and drops it on the ground. Sam strips
          off his uniform down to his white briefs. Suzy take off
          everything except her underwear and a training bra. They
          throw their clothes into the water. Sam yells:
                         
                          SAM
           On three!
                         
          Suzy immediately counts very quickly. They both scream as
          they leap into the water. They swim toward each other,
          laughing and shouting.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A clothesline hung with Sam's and Suzy's wet clothes swaying
          like flags and snapping in the wind. The tent has been
          pitched on a low, sandy plateau close to the water. Two lines
          of shells mark a path to the entrance. A long stick is jammed
          into the ground with a flickering safety-candle stuck into
          the Y at the top. The kitten is asleep.
                         
          Sam sits on a folding stool in front of a portable easel. He
          dips his brush into a tin cup and paints. Suzy poses
          stretched out and propped up on one arm. She adjusts herself
          slightly.
                         
                          SUZY
           I like it here, but I don't like the
           name.
                         
                          SAM
           Me, neither.
           51.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring
           to it.
                         
                          SAM
           Let's change it. What should it be?
                         
                          SUZY
           Let me think for a minute.
                         
          Sam continues to paint while Suzy thinks.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of a deep blue, star-filled sky.
                         
          Suzy lies on her back on a flat rock in the middle of the
          cove looking up into the night. Sam wades out to her and
          climbs up beside her.
                         
                          SAM
           I made you some jewelry.
                         
          Sam holds up two dead, shimmering, opalescent beetles with
          fish-hooks threaded into their shells. Suzy looks enchanted.
                         
                          SAM
           Are your ears pierced?
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Inside the tent, lit by a lantern. Sam clenches his teeth as
          he forces one of the fish-hooks through Suzy's earlobe. Suzy
          screams murderously. Sam releases her. The beetle dangles
          neatly. A line of blood runs down the side of Suzy's neck.
          Sam holds up a little mirror. Suzy nods.
                         
                          SUZY
           It's pretty. Do the other one.
                         
          Sam switches to Suzy's other earlobe. She resumes her
          screaming.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam and Suzy standing on the beach listening to the French
          singer's record. They face each other, bobbing their heads
          and tilting awkwardly to the music. Suzy eventually begins to
          dance. Sam does something vaguely like the Twist. They press
          against each other and kiss. Suzy says quietly:
                         
                          SUZY
           It feels hard.
           52.
                         
                         
                          SAM
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Do you mind?
                         
                          SUZY
           I like it.
                         
                          SAM
                          (PAUSE)
           Tilt your head sideways.
                         
          Sam and Suzy kiss again. Sam pushes his hands through Suzy's
          hair and draws it back behind her ears. Suzy whispers:
                         
                          SUZY
           You can touch my chest.
                         
          Sam slides his hand up under the training bra and presses it
          onto Suzy's breast.
                         
                          SUZY
           They're going to grow more.
                         
          Sam nods. He looks to be in a trance.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam and Suzy sitting on a tree branch over the water eating
          raisins from Sam's hand. Suzy has flowers in her hair. She
          looks down into the water with her binoculars.
                         
                          SAM
           Why do you always use binoculars?
                         
          Suzy thinks for minute. She says finally:
                         
                          SUZY
           It helps me see things closer. Even if
           they're not very far away. I pretend it's
           my magic power.
                         
                          SAM
                          (IMPRESSED)
           That sounds like poetry. Poems don't
           always have to rhyme, you know. They're
           just supposed to be creative.
                         
          Suzy gives Sam the binoculars. He points them at her and
          stares.
                         
                          SAM
           What do you want to be? When you grow up.
           53.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           I don't know. I want to go on adventures,
           I think. Not get stuck in one place. How
           about you?
                         
                          SAM
                          (PAUSE)
           Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck,
           too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm
           just repeating what you just said, but I
           couldn't think of anything as good as it.
           On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown
           up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the
           exact future.
                         
                          SUZY
           That's true.
                         
                          SAM
           It's possible I may wet the bed, by the
           way. Later, I mean.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SURPRISED)
           OK.
                         
                          SAM
                          (RELUCTANTLY)
           I wish I didn't have to mention it, but
           just in case. I don't want to make you be
           offended.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SOFTLY)
           Of course, I won't.
                         
                          SAM
           Some people frown on these problems.
                         
          Suzy nods. She holds Sam's hand. She points to the scorpion
          brooch pinned to Sam's shirt.
                         
                          SUZY
           What's that one for?
                         
          Sam looks at the brooch. He shakes his head.
                         
                          SAM
           It's not an accomplishment. I inherited
           it from my mother. It's actually not
           meant for a male to wear -- but I don't
           give a damn.
                         
          Suzy nods thoughtfully. Pause.
           54.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Are your foster parents still mad at you?
           For getting in trouble so much.
                         
                          SAM
           I don't think so. We're getting to know
           each other better. I feel like I'm in a
           family now. Not like yours, but similar
           to one.
                         
                          SUZY
           I always wished I was an orphan. Most of
           my favorite characters are. I think your
           lives are more special.
                         
          Sam frowns. Tears suddenly well-up in his eyes. He shakes his
          head.
                         
                          SAM
           I love you, but you don't know what
           you're talking about.
                         
          Long pause. Suzy says genuinely:
                         
                          SUZY
           I love you, too.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A campfire burns in front of the tent. Sam lies on his back
          on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits
          Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud from a book called
          The Light of Seven Matchsticks. There is an illustration on
          the cover of a child's hand extinguishing a little flame. A
          ribbon of smoke curls between its fingers.
                         
                          SUZY
           The flashlight's beam drew a moon through
           the black across the attic and settled on
           a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no
           bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched
           on his flat feet and placed his hand in
           front of the tiny opening. "It's windy,"
           he said. "Like someone in there's blowing
           on my fingers." Christy rolled her eyes
           and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she
           thought. Little brothers drive people
           crazy.
                         
          Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam nods and
          signals for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page and reads
                         ON:
           55.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Part Two.
                         
                         OMIT
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The next morning. Sam and Suzy are asleep with their arms
          wrapped around each other inside the tent. They wear only
          their underwear. The sound of an airplane approaches. Sam's
          eyes open. The noise buzzes by loudly overhead. Suzy sits up.
          Sam scrambles to his feet, unzips the flaps of the tent, and
          looks out. Suzy crouches beside him, holding onto his leg.
                         THEY SEE:
                         
          Captain Sharp standing on the beach fifteen feet away. Scout
          Master Ward waits behind him with Gadge, Skotak, and Lazy-
          Eye. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop stride up out of the water. Mr.
          Bishop looks incensed. They are wet to the waist. The police
          launch is moored in the lagoon. Two larger boats with St.
          Jack Wood Fire Brigade printed on their hulls float further
          away. Men in red caps stand on their decks.
                         
          Suzy pulls Sam back inside. She zips up the tent again. She
          kisses Sam. Mr. Bishop hollers:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Suzy! Get out here!
                         
          Mr. Bishop grabs hold of the entire tent by the top and rips
          it up out of the ground, uprooting the stakes which go
          flying. This reveals:
                         
          Sam and Suzy, half-naked, entwined, kissing.
                         
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both freeze. Sam and Suzy look up to
          them. Mr. Bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a
          monster. Sam and Suzy look horrified. Mr. Bishop's face
          suddenly drains of all emotion. Pause. Mrs. Bishop commands
          Sam and Suzy:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Put your clothes on. Both of you.
                         
          Sam and Suzy remain perfectly still. Mrs. Bishop grabs Suzy
          by the arm and jerks her to her feet. Sam and Suzy hang onto
          each other. Mrs. Bishop slaps Suzy with a whack. Sam lets go,
          and Suzy is gone.
                         
          Scout Master Ward comes over to Sam sadly and hands him his
          uniform. Sam takes it. Scout Master Ward turns to the other
          scouts, claps his hands twice, and says:
           56.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Strike this camp.
                         
          Sam starts putting on his socks. Captain Sharp watches him.
                         
          EXT. POLICE LAUNCH. DAY
                         
          Captain Sharp drives his boat along the coast with a grim
          look on his face. Suzy rides in the back with Mr. and Mrs.
          Bishop. Sam rides in the front with the other scouts. An
          interrogation is in progress:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           How long were you planning to stay there?
                         
                          SAM
           I don't know.
                         
                          MURRAY
           You said ten days or less.
                         
                          SUZY
           That was a lie.
                         
                          GADGE
           Didn't you ever think about what would
           happen next?
                         
                          SAM
           Not to my recollection.
                         
                          LIONEL
           You're a traitor to our family.
                         
                          SUZY
           Good. I want to be.
                         
          Scout Master Ward sits next to Captain Sharp. He shows him
          the air-mail envelope.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           What do I do about this?
                         
          Captain Sharp shrugs. He says, resigned:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Give him his mail.
                         
          Scout Master Ward turns to Sam. He holds out the envelope.
          Sam takes it. He opens it. He reads. Suzy watches him from
          across the boat. She calls out anxiously:
                         
                          SUZY
           What does it say?
           57.
                         
                         
                          SAM
                          (PUZZLED)
           They can't invite me back.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (OUTRAGED)
           Why not?
                         
                          SAM
                          (UPSET)
           I gave them too much aggravation.
                         
          Suzy stands up. She says as she starts across the boat:
                         
                          SUZY
           Let me read it.
                         
          Sam holds out the note. Mr. Bishop pulls Suzy back down to
          her seat. He stands up, himself, and walks over to Sam. He
          takes him by the wrist and leads him to a small cabin. He
          opens the door and presses him forward. Sam stumbles down the
          steps and looks back. Mr. Bishop shuts the door. Captain
          Sharp glares at him. Suzy says icily:
                         
                          SUZY
           That's child abuse.
                         
          Mr. Bishop returns to the back of the boat and sits down
          again. He gives Suzy a direct order:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Be advised: the two of you will never see
           each other again. Those were your last
           words. Do you understand?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (DARKLY)
           I'd be careful if I were you. One of
           these days somebody's going to be pushed
           too far, and who knows what they're
           capable of.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (HESITATES)
           Is that a threat?
                         
                          SUZY
                          (SIMPLY)
           It's a warning.
                         
          Suzy looks from Captain Sharp to Mrs. Bishop and back to Mr.
          Bishop. Mr. Bishop falls silent.
           58.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           I wish I knew what makes you tick.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (HESITATES)
           I beg your pardon?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Please, terminate this conversation.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (TO LIONEL)
           She's saying that to me?
                         
          Lionel shakes his head bitterly. Suzy stares out to sea.
          Scout Master Ward walks over to the cabin, opens the door,
          and goes inside.

          A small room with two bunks, two portholes, and a pile of
          ropes. Sam sits hunched over with his hands in his lap. He
          stares at the envelope. Scout Master Ward sits down across
          from him. He motions to the envelope and says quietly,
          pausing between each sentence:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           I'm sorry about this. I didn't know your
           situation. It's not on the register.
           How'd you lose your parents? I shouldn't
           ask that. Never mind. I wish we had time
           for an inspection back there. On the
           beach. I would've given you a
           "commendable". That was one of the best-
           pitched camp-sites I've ever seen.
           Honestly.
                         
          Sam does not respond. Scout Master Ward asks in a wounded
                         VOICE:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You don't want to be a Khaki Scout
           anymore?
                         
          Sam shakes his head.

          Becky sits at the switchboard with her head-phones on.
          Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward sit behind her wearing
          their own sets of head-phones. There is a click on the other
          end of the line.

          Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
          Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a
          fifty-year-old woman in a blue and white uniform pants-suit
          with a Salvation Army officer-style hat and a red ribbon tied
          in a bow around her neck. She is Social Services. She sits at
          a desk in a cinder block office. Guards and orderlies criss-
          cross in a bullet-proof window to a long, grey corridor
          behind her.

          Social Services flips open a file-folder and picks up a ball-
          point pen. (She takes notes throughout the conversation.) She

           Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand
           he's in your custody.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           That's correct.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           What's his condition? Has he suffered any
           injury or trauma of any kind?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           He's OK.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Very good. How do I get to you?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can
           bring you in with the mail.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's
           acceptable to you. Is someone able to
                          (MORE)
           60.
                         
           SOCIAL SERVICES (cont'd)
           provide reasonable care and nourishment
           for the boy until that time?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Uh-huh.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Is that a yes?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Uh-huh.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Very good. I'll contact you again before
           the end of the day.
                         
          Social Services starts to hang up the telephone. Captain
          Sharp says abruptly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Wait a second.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (HESITATES)
           Yes?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Social Services?
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (EVENLY)
           Captain Sharp.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (ANXIOUS)
           What's going to happen to him?
                         
          Pause. Social Services puts down her pen. She clasps her
          hands together in front of her. She says finally:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Well, normally, we'd try to place him in
           another foster home, but that option is
           no longer available to us, in my opinion,
           with his case history -- which means
           he'll go to Juvenile Refuge.
                         
          Captain Sharp exchanges a look with Scout Master Ward. Scout
          Master Ward interjects:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           What's that? An orphanage?
                         
          Social Services frowns. She asks calmly:
           61.
                         
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Who's speaking?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           This is Scout Master Ward.
                         
          Social Services refers to a document in her file-folder. She
          nods.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Right. An orphanage -- but the first step
           is the admissions panel requires a
           psychological evaluation to determine
           whether or not the boy's a candidate for
           institutional treatment or electroshock
           therapy. Beyond that --
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that
           be necessary? He's not violent.
                         
          Social Services picks up the document. She points to it.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           The report describes an assault with
           scissors.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (OBJECTING)
           That was the girl! Who did that.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (PAUSE)
           Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but
           that's not our job. OK?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (LONG PAUSE)
           OK.
                         
          Social Service hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords
          out of their sockets. Scout Master Ward looks to Captain
          Sharp. Silence.
                         
          Becky opens a tin of home-made lemon bars. Captain Sharp
          declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He looks
          completely enchanted.
                         
          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          The living room. There is a wicker rocking chair, a vase
          filled with wilted wildflowers, and a portrait of some
           62.
                         
                         
          Pilgrims hanging over a stone fireplace. Lionel, Murray, and
          Rudy sit together on the floor playing Parchesi.
                         
          Mr. Bishop lurches into the doorway, shirtless. He carries an
          open bottle of red wine with a glass in one hand and a long-
          handled woodsman's axe in the other.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           I'll be out back.
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Lionel look up from their game. Mr.
          Bishop hesitates. He seems slightly disoriented.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           I'm going to find a tree to chop down.
                         
          Mr. Bishop exits. Pause. Lionel rolls a pair of dice.
                         
          INT. SUZY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT
                         
          Old linoleum floor. Dark curtainless window. One bare light
          bulb. Suzy sits erect in the bathtub staring blankly into
          space. Mrs. Bishop washes her with a soapy sponge. Suzy's
          clothes and leather folder are in the corner with the kitten
          scratching at them.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean.
           I've had moments myself where I say: what
           am I doing here? Who made this decision?
           How could I allow myself to do something
           so stupid --
                          (WITH FEELING)
           -- and why is it still happening? We
           women are more emotional. You have to
                          REMEMBER --
                         
          Suzy turns to Mrs. Bishop and interrupts:
                         
                          SUZY
           I hate you.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (HESITATES)
           Don't say "hate".
                         
                          SUZY
           Why not? I mean it.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           You think you mean it. In this moment.
           You're trying to hurt me.
           63.
                         
                         
                          SUZY
           Exactly.
                          (PAUSE)
           I know what you do with that sad, dumb
           police man. You go to bed with him.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop looks stunned. She says quietly:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           He's not dumb, but I guess he is kind of
           sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that.
           It's not appropriate for me to even
           acknowledge what I already just said.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop sees something sticking out of the leather
          folder. She pulls it out and stares at it. It is the "Coping
          with the Very Troubled Child" pamphlet. She looks to Suzy.
          Suzy looks away. Mrs. Bishop sighs deeply and says, on the
          verge of tears:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for
           you?
                         
          Suzy starts to cry. She covers her face. Her voice breaks as
                         SHE SAYS:
                         
                          SUZY
           We're in love. We just want to be
           together. What's wrong with that?
                         
          Mrs. Bishop puts her arms around Suzy. Suzy shakes, silently
          sobbing. Mrs. Bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of Suzy's
          hair. She studies the beetle earrings. She says wearily:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Oh, my God. How are we going to get these
           fish-hooks out?
                         
          INT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT
                         
          Captain Sharp cooks sausages on a skillet in a kitchenette.
          He has a bottle of beer in his hand. Sam sits waiting at a
          fold-out table with a glass of milk in front of him. He says
          without looking up:
                         
                          SAM
           I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That
           part's true. We knew people would be
           worried, and we still ran away, anyway --
           but something also happened which we
           didn't do on purpose. When we first met
           each other. Something happened to us.
           64.
                         
                         
          Captain Sharp stirs the sausages in the pan. He nods. He says
                         SERIOUSLY:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I agree with you. That's eloquent. I
           can't argue against anything you're
           saying -- but I don't have to, because
           you're twelve years old.
                         
          Captain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves
          three links onto one plate and three onto another. He sits
          down.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Look, let's face it, you're probably a
           much more intelligent person than I am.
           In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart
           kids sometimes stick their fingers in
           electrical sockets, if you see what I
           mean. It takes time to figure things out.
           It's been proven by history: all mankind
           makes mistakes. It's our job to try to
           protect you from the dangerous ones. If
           we can.
                         
          Captain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides
          it over to Sam.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           You want a slug?
                         
          Sam nods. He and Captain Sharp both drink sips. Captain Sharp
          asks gently and sincerely:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What's the rush? You've got your whole
           life in front of yourself. Ahead of you,
           I mean.
                         
                          SAM
                          (SHRUGS)
           Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (DEFENSIVE)
           What does that have to do with it? So are
           you.
                         
                          SAM
                          (SADLY)
           That's true. Did you love someone ever?
           65.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (PAUSE)
           Yes, I did.
                         
                          SAM
           What happened?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           She didn't love me back.
                         
                          SAM
           Ah.
                         
          Sam considers this. Captain Sharp looks depressed. They start
          eating their sausages. Captain Sharp says quietly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's
           what people say.
                         
                          SAM
           Thanks.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           What happened?
                         
                          SAM
           A drunk truck driver smashed into them.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (PAINED)
           Good grief.
                         
          Silence. Captain Sharp refills both their beer glasses.
                         
          INT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. NIGHT
                         
          Scout Master Ward sits on his cot in his pajamas again with a
          cigarette in his mouth. His tape recorder is recording. He
          says into the microphone:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Scout Master's Log. September fourth.
                         
          Scout Master Ward hesitates. He thinks for a minute. He takes
          a deep breath. He closes his eyes. He opens them again. He
          looks desperate. He looks up at the ceiling. He shakes his
          head. He presses stop. He kneels on the floor with his palms
          together and smokes.
                         
          There is a slight commotion outside. Scout Master Ward
                         SHOUTS:
           66.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Stow it, out there! I want to hear some
           Z's!
                         
          INT. TREE HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          The fort sixty feet above the camp. It is still under
          construction. The entire troop (with the exceptions of
          Redford and Sam) has gathered for a clandestine meeting. They
          all wear pajamas. Skotak stands on a balcony with his back to
          the group and his hands on a wooden railing.
                         
                          GADGE
           I heard he's going to reform school.
                         
                          DELUCA
           I heard they're going to take out a piece
           of his brain and send him to an insane
           asylum.
                         
                          ROOSEVELT
           I like his girl.
                         
                          PANAGLE
           She's too scruffy for me.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           Supposedly, they got to third base.
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           That's not true. He just felt her up.
                         
                          ROOSEVELT
                          (DEEPLY INTRIGUED)
           Over-shirt or under-shirt?
                         
          Skotak slams his fist on the railing. Everyone looks
          startled. Skotak turns around to face the group. He says
                         ANGRILY:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Damn us.
                         
          The railing collapses behind Skotak, ripping part of a wall
          and a row of shingles off the structure as it falls away.
          There is a moment of silence before it hits the ground with a
          splintering thud. Skotak hesitates. He moves a half-step away
          from the edge. He continues:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           This troop has been very shabby to Field
           Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a
           bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so
           unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's
                          (MORE)
           67.
                         
                          SKOTAK (CONT'D)
           emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a
           disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?
                         
          Skotak moves among the group, looking from face to face, as
                         HE ASKS:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye?
           (from the heart)
           Gadge?
                         
          Skotak circles around the edge of the tree house. He says
                         WITH FEELING:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs
           our help. Are we man enough to give that?
           So part of his brain doesn't get removed
           out of him.
                         
          Skotak stands still. He says mysteriously:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           They were prepared to die for each other
           out there.
                         
          Silence. The other scouts begin to murmur to each other,
          shaking their heads, shrugging, whispering, and gesturing.
          Finally, Deluca looks up to Skotak.
                         
                          DELUCA
           What do you need?
                         
                          SKOTAK
                          (EXCITED)
           For starters? Three yards of chicken
           wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a
           bucket of wheatpaste.
                         
          EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          A thick tree has been chopped almost completely through its
          trunk. For some reason, it remains standing. Mr. Bishop sits
          on the ground leaning against it. He breathes heavily. The
          axe rests across his lap.
                         
          A twig snaps. Mr. Bishop looks up, listening. Pause. He
          drinks a sip of wine.
                         
          In the background, on the other side of the lawn, five small
          silhouettes run silently in a row away from the house into
          the trees on the left. A moment later, one taller silhouette
          rides a bicycle silently away from the house into the trees
          on the right.
           68.
                         
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD. NIGHT
                         
          Captain Sharp sits on the hood of his station wagon. Mrs.
          Bishop leans against it with her bicycle in front of her.
          They smoke cigarettes. Captain Sharp says sadly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           In other words, it's over.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I guess so. For the moment.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Until further notice.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           That's right.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I understand.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I've got to do better. For everybody.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Except me.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Except you.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (SINCERELY)
           Well, I hope you can. I think you will.
           You're doing the right thing.
                         
          Pause. Captain Sharp suddenly slides his hand inside Mrs.
          Bishop's shirt onto her breast and simultaneously kisses her
          -- then just as suddenly gets into his car and starts the
          engine. Mrs. Bishop hesitates. She reaches inside the window
          and puts her hand on the top of Captain Sharp's head. She
          says, worried:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Who know what's going to happen, Duffy?
           I'll probably see you tomorrow.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (CALMLY)
           No, you won't.
                         
          Silence. The motor idles. Captain Sharp says distantly:
           69.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I admire them, you know? There's a purity
           to it. I only feel bad because they both
           seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable
           people -- but maybe that's romantic.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (PUZZLED)
           I don't see it that way.
                         
          Captain Sharp puts the car into gear and drives off. Mrs.
          Bishop finishes her cigarette. She gets on her bicycle and
          rides away.
                         
          INT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT
                         
          A burning match drops down into the fireplace near the foot
          of a bunk where Sam lies sleeping. He has the sheet pulled up
          to his chin, but his toes stick out. He opens one eye. Dust
          descends and settles. Something scrapes and scratches. The
          flame burns out.
                         
          Sam slides slowly off the mattress and creeps across the
          floor. He crouches in front of the fireplace. He flicks on a
          scout flashlight and sees:
                         
          The end of a hanging rope.
                         
          Sam leans quickly into the fireplace and looks straight up,
          shining his flashlight. Skotak is looking down at him from
          the top of the chimney. He puts his finger to his lips. Sam
                         WHISPERS SHARPLY:
                         
                          SAM
           Get out of my chimney.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Listen to me. We're here for friendship.
           We're going to get you off this island.
                         
                          SAM
                          (LONG PAUSE)
           No, thanks.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue.
                         
                          SAM
           It's worthless to me. There's no point.
           Not without Suzy.
                         
          Skotak gestures for Sam to wait. He disappears from view. A
          moment later, Suzy's face appears at the top of the chimney,
          smiling toothily. Sam looks ecstatic.
           70.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           How'd you get here?
                         
                          SUZY
           They snuck me down the laundry chute and
           left a paper-maché dummy in my bed.
                         
                          SAM
                          (IMPRESSED)
           Diversion tactics. Good thinking.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The next room. Captain Sharp sleeps in boxer shorts on the
          floor of the kitchenette in the dark. He snores quietly.
                         
          EXT. ROUGH CHANNEL. NIGHT
                         
          Five mini-canoes race across a wide, choppy strait close to
          the open sea. Skotak, Deluca, Nickleby, Gadge, Lazy-Eye,
          Panagle, Roosevelt, Chef, and Izod paddle aggressively. We
          hear in voice-over:
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Where we going?
                         
           SKOTAK (V.O.)
           Fort Lebanon. My cousin Ben runs the
           Supply and Resources outpost for the
           Jubilee. He's a Falcon Scout,
           Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to
           do.
                         
           SAM (V.O.)
           Can we trust him?
                         
           SKOTAK (V.O.)
           Normally, I'd say no.
                         
          Sam and Suzy ride in the back of the canoe that Skotak rows.
          Sam has his arms around Suzy's waist. The kitten is on her
          shoulder. Sam sees the portable record player among Suzy's
          things.
                         
                          SAM
           Did you leave another note for Lionel?
                         
                          SUZY
           Not this time. He can't keep his trap
           shut. Besides, I'll probably never see
           him again.
           71.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           That's true.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A pebble beach below high dunes. Large waves sweep into the
          shore. Spray blows through the air. There is a black
          lighthouse on a rocky point in the distance. The narrator
          stands at the water's edge holding a meteorologist's
          measuring stick. He braces himself against the gusting winds.
          He speaks to the camera:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           This is the island of St. Jack Wood,
           extending far north from Land's End along
           the deep-water channel that leads to
           Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates
           the beach from the town-ship above. A
           small but prosperous community.
                         
          The narrator takes out a pocket barometer. He reads it. He
                         SAYS GRAVELY:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           The barometer reads twenty-seven inches
           and dropping. Strong winds, as you can
           see, already at twenty-two knots.
           (checks his watch)
           The time is now four thirty-five A.M.
                         
          The narrator walks quickly out of the shot. The five canoes
          land on the beach with the tide. Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the
          rest of the troop quickly jump out and drag the boats up the
          shore.
                         
          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
                         
          The room is black. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop lie in separate single
          beds side-by-side. They both stare at the ceiling. The
          windows rattle, the walls creak, and trees sway outside.
                         
          Long pause. Mrs. Bishop whispers:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Did you file the motion for continuance?
           Peabody vs. Henderson.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           It was sustained.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Good.
           72.
                         
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (PAUSE)
           Did the judge consider your application
           for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           He granted it.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Great.
                         
          Silence. Mrs. Bishop's voice breaks as she says quietly:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I'm sorry, Walt.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           It's not your fault. Which injuries are
           you apologizing for? Specifically.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (WISTFULLY)
           Half of those were self-inflicted.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop shakes her head and smiles with tears on her
          face. A powerful blast of wind shakes the room. A night-light
          blinks. Mr. Bishop has a lump in his throat as he says:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           I hope the roof flies off, and I get
           sucked up into space. You'll be better
           off without me.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (SADLY)
           Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (PAINED)
           Why?
                         
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop look across at each other in the dark.
          Mrs. Bishop says desperately:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           We're all they've got, Walt.
                         
          Mr. Bishop takes a deep breath. He says finally, with a
                         DAWNING REALIZATION:
           73.
                         
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           It's not enough.
                         
          INT. STONE CAVE. NIGHT
                         
          Flashlight and lantern flames flicker over the jagged walls.
          Skotak is curled in a blanket on a high rock. Gadge is tucked
          into a sleeping bag under a ledge. The troop nestle on rocks
          and ledges in bedrolls and sleeping bags all around the deep
          cavern.
                         
          Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe
          while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud
          from a book called Annabelle's Midnight. There is an
          illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a
          window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her.
                         
                          SUZY
           "-- but I'm not going," said Barnaby
           Jack. "I'm running away tonight for good,
           and this time I won't get caught."
           Annabelle whispered: "I'm coming with
           you." Her yellow hair, now brown at the
           roots, caught up in the wind and danced.
           Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and
           pressed something into it the size of a
           jellybean. "Hide this in your socks, and
           be ready at midnight."
                         
          Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam looks to
          the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake. They
          all nod and signal for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page
          and reads on:
                         
                          SUZY
           He leapt out the window and landed in the
           fresh-fallen snow.
                         
          EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
                         
          The next morning. Camp Ivanhoe. Scout Master Ward emerges
          from his tent. He puts on his hat. The wind whips it off his
          head. He chases it, catches it, and puts it back on with the
          chin-strap tight. He frowns. He shouts:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           No bugle? No reveille? Lazy-eye, Gadge,
           Deluca, Izod? Where's my troop? Let's go!
           You're late!
                         
          Scout Master Ward tries to light a cigarette, but the match
          blows out. He walks past the latrine, the workbench, the row
          of smaller tents, and the charcoal grill. He throws his hands
          into the air.
           74.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Chef? Breakfast?
                         
          Scout Master Ward shakes his head. He arrives at the picnic
          table and rings his bell. He sits down. He opens a new issue
          of Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover of a scout
          troop rappelling in Tasmania. He struggles to keep the
          rippling pages from turning by themselves.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The first page. There is another drawing of the Scout Master-
          in-Chief. This time he is behind the wheel of a ship. His
          signature below, once again, reads Commander Pierce. There is
          a quotation in large text: "Anyone can hold the helm when the
          sea is calm."
                         
          Pause. Scout Master Ward lowers his magazine. He looks
          around, confused. Something dawns on him.
                         
          INT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
                         
          A small entourage of teenage scouts studies maps, charts, and
          documents at folding tables. One of them sits at a telegraph
          machine. He wears headphones and taps Morse code on a paddle
          as he listens to a transmission. He looks puzzled. He swivels
          his chair to a steno-machine and begins typing rapidly.
                         
          EXT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
                         
          A triple-sized tent with a canopy in front and a large totem
          pole looming over it. It stands on five-foot stilts. There is
          a school bus parked next to it with letters painted across
          its side which read Regional Jubilee.
                         
          A forty-five-year-old scout master with several medals on his
          chest is sharpening a straight razor. He is Secretary
          McIntire. He adjusts a hot towel on the face of a man in a
          barber's chair.
                         
          The young telegraph operator hurries out of the tent carrying
          a strip of paper. He hands it to Secretary McIntire.
          Secretary McIntire stares at it. He says to the man under the
                         TOWEL:
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           You're not going to believe this one,
           sir. That Scout Master on New Penzance?
           Has now lost his entire troop.
                         
          The seated man whips the towel off his face and rises to his
          feet. He is Commander Pierce himself. He has silver hair, a
          moustache, and a much greater number of medals. He says in
          disbelief as he snatches the slip of paper:
           75.
                         
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo?
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
                          (VAGUELY)
           I couldn't say.
                         
          Commander Pierce shakes his head. He continues to study the
          document as he sits back down. Secretary McIntire begins to
          lather his cheeks with a brush.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A vast archway of wood, straw, and rope construction. Fort
          Lebanon is spelled out across the top with bound sticks. A
          large flag waving madly on a pole reads Khaki Scouts of North
          America. A bugler on a platform plays the familiar staccato
          tattoo. It echoes for miles.
                         
          Sam and Suzy wait inside the gates crouched behind a row of
          trash cans with the rest of the troop except Skotak. They
          shiver. Sam has on his back-pack. Suzy carries her suitcase.
          Gadge holds a tennis ball can.
                         
          A scout master in an Indian chief's headdress stops as he
          walks by. He looks curiously at Sam and especially Suzy. He
          says to Nickleby:
                         
                          GUARD SCOUT
           Who's your unit leader?
                         
          Pause. Nickleby points to a fat man in an apron cooking
          hamburgers on a grill.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           That guy.
                         
          The scout master shrugs. Skotak comes over and says
                         FURTIVELY:
                         
                          SKOTAK
           There's a broken gum-ball machine behind
           the snack tent.
                         
          Skotak distributes a handful of gum-balls among Sam, Suzy,
          and the rest of the troop. They all put them in their mouths.
          Skotak motions for everyone to follow him.
                         
          A footbridge across a stream leads to a Quonset hut with an
          awning in front labelled Supply Tent. A crowd of very young
          scouts waits at a wide counter bartering over boxes of food,
          drink, and equipment. A team of helpers collects money and
          packages goods. At the center, there is a twenty-year-old
           76.
                         
                         
          scout with a pencil behind his ear. He is Cousin Ben. He says
          to a nine-year-old Junior Khaki:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I don't care how they do it where you
           come from. You want pop? You want candy?
           You want a snake-bite kit? Get some
           money.
                         
          Skotak appears and whispers something to Cousin Ben. Cousin
          Ben nods. He says to his customers:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Come back in five minutes.
                         
          Cousin Ben pulls a curtain shut behind the counter.
                         
          EXT. WOODEN PROMENADE. DAY
                         
          Sam, Suzy, Skotak and the rest of the troop follow Cousin Ben
          briskly out a door and onto a cat-walk that runs along the
          top of a wall made from tall, pointed logs. As they talk,
          they walk past dozens of rows and clusters of tents grouped
          by color in the fields below. They walk past towers, huts,
          ladders, latrines, and a catapult under construction. They
          walk past a white infirmary with a red cross on it and a
          doctor taking a boy's blood pressure. They walk past a fleet
          of small, antique sailboats flying assorted troop banners.
          Five hundred scouts and fifty scout masters work, eat, talk,
          cook, and play sports and games all around the compound in
          spite of the fierce winds. One group rides motorcycles,
          another fires model rockets, another flies by overhead on a
          cable-trolley.
                         
          Cousin Ben points to Sam and asks Skotak over the sound of
                         THE WIND:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Is this him?
                         
                          SAM
           Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55,
           resigned.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the
           can?
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in
           nickels.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Give it to me.
           77.
                         
                         
          Skotak motions for Gadge to hand Cousin Ben the tennis ball
          can. It appears to be very heavy and jingles as it moves.
          Cousin Ben takes it. He says to Sam:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           You badge in seamanship?
                         
                          SAM
           Yes, sir.
                         
          Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has an
          anchor embroidered on it.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Good. There's cold-water crabber moored
           off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an
           I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as
           a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life,
           but it's better than shock therapy.
                         
                          SAM
           Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the
           chapel tent?
                         
          Cousin Ben hesitates. He points behind them with his thumb:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Back there, but the padre's home with the
           mumps. Why do you ask?
                         
                          SAM
           I want to bring my wife.
                         
          Cousin Ben stops walking. He looks Sam up and down. Suzy says
                         BEHIND HIM:
                         
                          SUZY
           But we're not married yet.
                         
          Cousin Ben turns to Suzy. He looks back to Sam and back to
          Suzy again.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           You his girl?
                         
          Suzy nods. Cousin Ben looks intrigued. He says tentatively:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener.
           I'm authorized to declare births, deaths,
           and marriages. You're kind of young. You
           got a license?
           78.
                         
                         
          Sam and Suzy shake their heads. Cousin Ben nods. He speaks
          more gently now:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I can't offer you a legally binding
           union. It won't hold up in the state, the
           county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the
           world due to your age, lack of a license,
           and failure to get parental consent --
           but the ritual does carry a very
           important moral weight within yourselves.
           You can't enter into this lightly. Do you
           love each other?
                         
          Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben continues:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Are you sure you're ready for this?
                         
          Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben looks perturbed.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Let me rephrase it.
                         
                          SUZY
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           We're in a hurry.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
                          (SNAPPING)
           Spit out the gum, sister. In fact,
           everybody.
                         
          Cousin Ben puts out his hand. Suzy spits her gum into his
          palm. He throws it away over his shoulder. Sam and the rest
          of the troop spit their gum out on the ground. Cousin Ben
                         SAYS STERNLY:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I don't like the snappy attitude. This is
           the most important decision you've made
           in your lives. Now go over by that
           trampoline and talk it through before you
           give me another quick answer.
                         
          Cousin Ben watches as Sam and Suzy walk away and stand next
          to a large trampoline. A small scout jumps from a high
          ladder, bounces, and does a back-flip.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Sam and Suzy uncertain how to begin the conversation. Sam
          shrugs.
           79.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           I guess we better try to pretend we're
           struggling over our decision for a minute
           before we go back over there and tell him --
                         
                          SUZY
           Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake.
                         
          Sam looks stunned. He is speechless. He stammers:
                         
                          SAM
           What? Why? How?
                         
                          SUZY
           Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to
           me. It might be better to just go steady
           permanently.
                         
          Sam shakes his head. He looks off into the distance. He says
                         QUIETLY:
                         
                          SAM
           I don't know what to say.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Cousin Ben counting nickels in the tennis ball can. He jerks
          his thumb toward Sam and Suzy and says dismissively:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           I guess they're probably just trying to
           pretend they're struggling over their
           decision, but at least --
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Woah!
                         
          Cousin Ben looks. Suzy has her hands around Sam's throat and
          is throttling him. Sam squirms loose and calms her down. The
          troop watches transfixed. Sam takes a snapshot out of his
          pocket and shows it to Suzy, explaining. Suzy nods. They come
          back over to the group. There are tears on Suzy's cheeks. She
          says to Cousin Ben:
                         
                          SUZY
           We're sure.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           OK. Let's do a blood test.
                         
          INT. CHAPEL TENT. DAY
                         
          Cousin Ben stands at a collapsible altar. He wears a purple,
          silk stole around his neck with crosses stitched into it. Sam
           80.
                         
                         
          and Suzy hold a Bible with their hands on it. Skotak and the
          rest of troop listen solemnly as Cousin Ben reads from a
                         MANUAL:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           -- which we hereby consecrate on this
           day, the fifth of September, 1965.
                          (LOOKING UP)
           That's the end of the short-form. Do any
           of the witnesses have objections or
           remarks? Usually, they don't.
                         
          Skotak raises his hand. Cousin Ben reluctantly calls on him:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Skotak.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried
           about their future.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
                          (OFFENDED)
           That's my fee.
                         
          Skotak and the rest of the troop look very concerned. They
          murmur to each other:
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           What's going to happen to them?
                         
                          GADGE
           Nobody knows.
                         
                          DELUCA
           Let's take a vote.
                         
                          SKOTAK
           All in favor --
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
                          (LOUDLY)
           That's my fee.
                         
          Skotak and the rest of the troop look to Cousin Ben. Cousin
          Ben glares at them. He sighs. He points to Skotak.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           You're just like your brothers. OK, give
           them the tennis ball can.
                         
          Cousin Ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to
          his feet. Skotak takes it and zips it into a side-pocket of
           81.
                         
                         
          Sam's back-pack. Cousin Ben hands Sam and Suzy a receipt on a
          clipboard.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Sign here -- and initial here and here.
                         
          Sam and Suzy sign and initial. Cousin Ben tears out a copy.
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's
           go.
                         
          Sam and Suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding
          hands. They do not smile. Cousin Ben, Skotak, and the rest of
          the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces.
          Sam touches Suzy's hair. Suzy kisses Sam's hand. They walk as
          a group through the camp.
                         
                         OMIT
                         
          EXT. CAMP MARINA. DAY
                         
          Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop wait at the end
          of a narrow dock. Cousin Ben stands below them in a small
          sailboat. He reaches up to Suzy and lifts her onboard. He
          reaches up to Sam and lifts him onboard, too. He rigs the
          sail.
                         
          Sam smiles sadly. He and Skotak do the secret handshake. The
          others quickly join in. Suzy blows them a kiss. Everyone
          looks choked up.
                         
          Cousin Ben unloops a line. The sails quickly catch the strong
          wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor. Skotak and the
          rest of troop wave and salute. They watch, bittersweet.
          Pause.
                         
                          NICKLEBY
           Where they going again?
                         
                          GADGE
           He's going to work on a shrimper, if I
           understand correctly.
                         
                          SKOTAK
                          (WISTFULLY)
           I wish them well.
                         
                          LAZY-EYE
           Me, too. Me, too.
                         
          Skotak sighs. He turns and starts up the dock. The others
          follow him. Roosevelt hesitates. He points.
           82.
                         
                         
                          ROOSEVELT
           I think they're coming back.
                         
          Skotak and the rest of the troop stop and turn around. The
          sailboat glides back in. Sam leaps onto the dock with the
          tennis ball can. Suzy looks worried. Cousin Ben yells:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Be quick, sailor!
                         
                          SKOTAK
                          (PUZZLED)
           What happened?
                         
                          SAM
                          (QUICKLY)
           She left her binoculars on a hook in the
           chapel tent.
                         
                          DELUCA
                          (SHRUGS)
           Just leave them.
                         
          Sam sprints up the dock. He yells back over his shoulder:
                         
                          SAM
           We can't. It's her magic power!
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of Sam running full-speed through the
          compound. He approaches quickly -- then skids to a stop.
                         
          EXT. CHAPEL TENT. DAY
                         
          Redford blocks the entrance. He is dressed in white hospital
          pajamas with a red cross on the breast pocket. His side is
          heavily bandaged and his arm is attached to an I/V drip. He
          lowers Suzy's binoculars.
                         
          Sam stands frozen in front of Redford. Redford stares at him
          icily. Sam starts to say something -- then pauses. He says,
                         INSTEAD:
                         
                          SAM
           You killed your dog, by the way.
                         
                          REDFORD
                          (HESITATES)
           Snoopy?
                          (SHRUGS)
           Well, it couldn't be helped.
                         
          Sam nods. He asks quietly:
           83.
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Why do you consider me your enemy?
                         
          Redford frowns. He says in disbelief:
                         
                          REDFORD
           Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the
           back with lefty scissors.
                         
                          SAM
           She's my wife now.
                         
                          REDFORD
           Congratulations.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago.
           From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm
           trying to understand.
                          (IN SUMMATION)
           Why don't you like me?
                         
                          REDFORD
                          (LONG PAUSE)
           Why should I? Nobody else does.
                         
          Sam runs up to Redford and pokes him as hard as he can in the
          scissor cut with his finger. Redford screams.
                         
          Scouts and scout masters everywhere stop what they are doing
          and look to the chapel tent. Across the compound, Commander
          Pierce comes out of his tent, alerted.
                         
          Sam whips the binoculars out of Redford's hands, turns away,
          and sprints. No one moves anywhere except Sam dashing toward
          the marina. Redford shouts at the top of his lungs:
                         
                          REDFORD
           He's here! The fugitive! Stop him!
                         
          An emergency alarm sounds. The entire camp swings into
          action. Two teams of scouts playing capture-the-flag descend
          from both sides and cut Sam off from the dock. They wear red
          and yellow jerseys over their uniforms.
                         
          Suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock. Sam sees her beyond
          the blockade of scouts. She waves her arms. Sam throws up his
          hands. He sprints in a new direction, onto a wide field.
          There is a small, pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the
          ground at the center of a plastic ring. Sam grabs it as he
          runs past. He looks back and sees:
           84.
                         
                         
          A mob of fifty scouts chasing him. He circles in a giant
          figure eight trailed by the huge group. He races up a hill
          and stops at the top.
                         
          Sam looks down at the approaching scouts and hundreds of
          others watching. A dark cloud rolls in casting a giant shadow
          over the entire camp. Sam throws the little flag down at his
          pursuers like a javelin. It sails in an arc and pokes down
          into the grass. There is a thunderclap. Sam looks up into the

          A bolt of lightning strikes him.
                         
          Sam is thrown ten feet through the air and lands on his back.
          The tennis ball can explodes nickels. The mob of scouts stops
          with a jolt. They look terrified. Sam sits up. He is covered
          in black soot. His shoes are on fire. He shakes them off his
          feet.
                         
          Suzy runs through the crowd of scouts and drops down on her
          knees in front of Sam. She looks astonished. Sam says
                         QUICKLY:
                         
                          SAM
           I'm OK.
                         
          Suzy helps Sam to his feet. Sam raises Suzy's smoldering
          binoculars to his eyes. Skotak and the rest of the troop join
          them.

          A binocular shot of a ladder leaning against a high fence.
                         SAM SHOUTS:
                         
                          SAM
           Follow me!
                         
          Sam leads Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop fly at a
          sprint to the fence, climb the ladder, and pull it up after
          them. A bugle plays a cavalry charge. The mob bolts after
          them.

          Scout Master Ward, and Becky wearing their operator head-
          phones. On the other side, we see Commander Pierce, Secretary
          McIntire, and the commander's entourage inside the command
          tent. Commander Pierce says into his field-telephone:

                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Stand by, Commander Pierce.
                         
          Captain Sharp spins around in his chair and flips a switch on
          a two-way radio. He says into a microphone:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Jed, re-route to St. Jack Wood. Tell

          Captain Sharp sets down the microphone. He turns to Becky.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Becky, notify the Bishops: Suzy's there.
                         
          Becky nods. Captain Sharp turns to Scout Master Ward.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Randy? You monitoring?
                         
          Scout Master Ward is already on his feet. He peels off his
          head-phones.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Affirmative. I'm on my way.
                         
          Becky plugs a cord into a socket and says:
                         
                          BECKY
           Hello! Mr. Bishop?
                         
          Captain Sharp looks out the window with a sense of dread.
                         
          INT. BISHOP HOUSE. DAY
                         
          Mr. Bishop listens on the telephone with a strained look on
          his face. Mrs. Bishop watches him intently.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Oh, dear God.
                         
          Mr. Bishop grabs Mrs. Bishop by the wrist. He says grimly:

          Mrs. Bishop raises her megaphone to her mouth. She shouts:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP

          A deHavilland Beaver in heavy rain and turbulence. Jed speaks
          into his radio while piloting the aircraft. Social Services
          sits beside him in the passenger's seat. She looks queasy but
          determined.

          Jed presses the yoke forward, and the plane dips hard. Social
          Services braces against the dash.
                         
          EXT. MOTORBOAT. DAY
                         
          Scout Master Ward steers his outboard through the open
          channel. The boat crests high over deep swells, flooding over
          in waves. Scout Master Ward is drenched. He does not flinch
          or even appear to notice.
                         
          EXT. FOREST PATH. DAY
                         
          Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop scramble through
          the woods as fast as they can. There are flashes of lightning
          and pounding thunder. Suzy trips on a root, and Sam pulls her
          to her feet. Sam trips on a rock, and Suzy pulls him to his
          feet.
                         
          INT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
                         
          The commander's entourage is frantically packing up their
          portable telephones, P.A. system, folding tables, collapsible
          chairs, etc. One of them wraps a tarp around boxes labelled
          Fireworks.

           effect. Take immediate precautions.
                         
          Commander Pierce and Secretary McIntire listen to the report.
          Secretary McIntire says gravely:
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           That's coming our way.
                         
          Captain Pierce nods, worried. The capture-the-flag scouts in
          soaking jerseys gather, winded, outside the tent. One of the
          team captains stands in the entrance breathing heavily.
          Commander Pierce points to him:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           You find them?

           No, sir.

           Prepare to mobilize to higher ground.
                         
          Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce an envelope with
          red-and-white stripes on it. Commander Pierce rips it open.
                         HE READS:

          The set for the ark stands on the platform behind the altar.
          There are candles and garlands in place, but also stacks of
           88.
                         
                         
          cardboard boxes and gallons of distilled-water. Numerous
          animal costumes hang from a rolling garment rack. An old nun
          crosses the aisle carrying a large, metal coffee dispenser.
          Two young priests cross in the opposite direction carrying
          folding cots. Voices shout urgently off-screen:

          Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop slowly poke
          their heads in from the side door and creep up the stairs to
          the choir loft.
                         
          EXT. SCOUT FESTIVAL. DAY
                         
          The entire brigade of scouts stands assembled in formation in
          the rain. The last two stragglers come running and hurry into
          their positions. They all wear rain slickers or canvas
          ponchos. Commander Pierce, Secretary McIntire, and the
          commander's entourage emerge quickly from the command tent.
          Commander Pierce shouts:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           Attention, company! Prepare for --
                         
          Commander Pierce hesitates. He points down to the marina and
          says to Secretary McIntire:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           Who's that?
                         
          Secretary McIntire and the commander's entourage turn to see:
                         
          Scout Master Ward speeding toward the dock in his motorboat.
          He leaps to shore, throws a line over a post, and sprints up
          to the assembly. He salutes Commander Pierce. Commander
          Pierce frowns and asks with quiet ferocity:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE

          Commander Pierce looks at Scout Master Ward's breast pocket.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          A name-tag that reads Scout Master Ward next to a patch with
          a picture of a snow-capped mountain. It says K.S.N.A.
          Leadership underneath.
                         
          Commander Pierce says bitterly:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           I'm field-stripping you of your command.
                         
          Commander Pierce rips the patch off Scout Master Ward's
          uniform and throws it aside. He holds out his hand, palm up.
          Scout Master Ward looks stricken. He reaches into his pocket,
          takes out his scout pocket-knife, and hands it Commander
          Pierce. Commander Pierce puts it into his own pocket. He
                         SHOUTS:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           Attention, company! Prepare for emergency
           evacuation!
                         
          Secretary McIntire leans close to Commander Pierce. He
                         WHISPERS DISCREETLY:
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           Sir, do you have your medicine?
                         
          Commander Pierce hesitates. He holds up a finger.
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           I'll be right back.
                         
          Commander Pierce strides back into the command tent.
          Secretary McIntire looks to Scout Master Ward, uneasy. Scout
          Master Ward stares down at the ground.
                         
          The flash-flood explodes out from the woods.
                         
          Gushing water pours down the hillside, cuts a swath through
          the center of the camp, and tears down everything in its
          narrow path. The command tent suddenly becomes a tiny island
          at the center of a rushing river.
           90.
                         
                         
          The company is taken aback. Scout Master Ward stiffens,
          watchful. The totem pole creaks and sways, then falls cleanly
          onto the command tent, splitting it down the middle. Inside,
          something sparks, pops, then blows up. The tent bursts into
          flames.
                         
          Secretary McIntire does not react. He stands perfectly still,
          watching the fire. Scout Master Ward taps him, grabs him, and
          shakes him. Secretary McIntire looks at him blankly. Scout
          Master Ward makes a snap decision. He turns to the company
                         AND SHOUTS:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Hold your position!
                         
          Scout Master Ward runs ahead, splashes into the raging flood,
          wades through it against the current, dodging branches and
          debris, then pulls himself up onto the fallen totem pole and
          walks balancing on it to the burning tent. He disappears
          inside.
                         
          Secretary McIntire and the vast company watch, riveted.
                         
          Scout Master Ward comes out the opposite side of the tent
          onto the other end of the fallen totem pole carrying
          Commander Pierce over his shoulders. He descends back into
          the water, trudges through it, and steps up onto the
          embankment. The company looks deeply, permanently impressed.
          Scout Master Ward hollers:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Company Secretary! Status report, sir!
                         
          Secretary McIntire hesitates. He stirs to attention and says
                         ENTHUSIASTICALLY:
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           All accounted for, Scout Master!
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Supply and Resources! Call it out!
                         
          Cousin Ben gives an A-OK sign near the front of the assembly.
                         HE SHOUTS:
                         
                          COUSIN BEN
           Affirmative, sir!
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Fall in! We're going to run for it, boys!
           Let's move!
                         
          The entire company follows Scout Master Ward with Commander
          Pierce over his shoulders at a fast jog out of the camp.
           91.
                         
                         
          INT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. DAY
                         
          The room has now been converted into a full-fledged refugee
          center. Families from the town-ship huddle in pews with bags
          and piles of their wet belongings. Priests and nuns
          distribute towels and sandwiches to frightened children. Dogs
          and cats prowl nervously. Sandbags are stacked in low walls
          outside the doors and windows. The rain beats on the roof,
          and lightning continues to flash through the stained glass.
                         
          A side door opens. Captain Sharp comes in from the storm with
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Lionel, Murray, Rudy, and the two old
          fishermen follow closely behind them. They slam the door.
          Captain Sharp looks around frantically.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Who's in charge here?
                         
          Another side door opens. Scout Master Ward jogs in with
          Commander Pierce still over his shoulders and the entire
          company behind him flooding into the room. Captain Sharp
          yells to him:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Randy! What happened?
                         
          Scout Master Ward goes over to Captain Sharp and turns his
          back to him, jogging in place.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Take the commander off of me.
                         
          Captain Sharp helps Commander Pierce down off Scout Master
          Ward's back and into a pew to rest. Secretary McIntire
          assists them. Mr. Bishop strides up the aisle yelling to the
          left and right:
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Suzy? Sam?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           (shaking his head)
           They ran away again.
                         
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop grimace, unbelievably frustrated. Scout
          Master Ward addresses the scouts:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           We're going back out. I need volunteers.
                         
          Hands raise. Scout Master Ward passes out walkie-talkies as
          he chooses his squad:
           92.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           You, you, you, you --
                         
          Becky steps in front of Scout Master Ward with her hand
          raised. Scout Master Ward hesitates.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           -- and you?
                         
          Becky takes a walkie-talkie. She looks at Scout Master Ward
          with admiration and asks, concerned:
                         
                          BECKY
           Are you all right?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (WARMLY)
           Of course, I am. Come on.
                         
          Scout Master Ward leads Becky by the arm through the crowded
          church as they begin to gather supplies: extra flashlights, a
          flare gun, coils of rope.
                         
          Captain Sharp looks up to the choir loft. Eleven children
          dressed in animal masks sit quietly in a row. Captain Sharp
          does a double-take. One of the animals is an otter wearing
          Sunday-school shoes and binoculars around its neck. Next to
          her is the male of the species in a sash with numerous small,
          embroidered patches on it.
                         
          The front doors open. There is lightning, thunder, wind, and
          rain. Social Services enters. She takes off a wet cape with a
          red lining and hands it to an acolyte in a robe. Jed presses
          the doors shut behind them. Social Services asks immediately:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Where's the boy?
                         
          Captain Sharp hesitates. He says reluctantly:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           We don't know yet.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           That's not acceptable.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           (pretending to be irritated)
           What do you want me to say, lady?
           (to no one in particular)
           Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee.
                         
          The acolyte runs to the coffee dispenser with a cardboard
          cup. Social Services charges over to Captain Sharp.
           93.
                         
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           You're Captain Sharp?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           That's right.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy
           to your personal custody. You're
           responsible for his safety. I'm told he
           was just struck by lightning.
                         
          Captain Sharp frowns. He looks to Scout Master Ward and says
                         SKEPTICALLY:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           That's the first I heard of it.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (UNFORTUNATELY)
           It's true.
                         
          Captain Sharp tries to process this. Social Services now
          moves in on Scout Master Ward. She says aggressively:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Scout Master Ward, I presume?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Yes, ma'am.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (BITINGLY)
           Your reputation precedes you.
                         
          Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward stand side-by-side in
          front of Social Services. She berates them:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           You two are the most appallingly
           incompetent custodial guardians Social
           Services has ever had the misfortune to
                          ENCOUNTER --
                          (SHOUTING)
           -- in a twenty-seven year career!
                         
          Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward look sheepish. Social
          Services says bitterly:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           What do you have to say for yourselves?
                         
          Captain Sharp hesitates. He says strangely:
           94.
                         
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           You can't do this. They'll eat him alive
           in there.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (HESITATES)
           Where?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           (aside, to Scout Master Ward)
           What's the name of the place again?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (HESITATES)
           Juvenile refuge?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (HORRIFIED)
           Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail.
                         
          Silence. In the background, the acolyte picks up Panagle's
          walking stick weapon off the floor. He stares at it, puzzled.
          Social Services says carefully:
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Just find the boy -- and deliver him --
           (motioning to herself)
           -- to Social Services. Nothing else is in
           your power.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (SHARPLY)
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Social Services, Captain Sharp, and Scout Master Ward turn to
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Mr. Bishop looks tense.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
           Can we get back to the rescue now?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
                          (URGENTLY)
           Suzy's still out there.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (FROWNING)
           Who are you?
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Walt and Laura Bishop. Their daughter's
           the missing girl.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           The parents of the stabber?
           95.
                         
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           I object to that description. She was
           attacked.
                         
          Commander Pierce appears with an oxygen mask over his face.
          He pulls it aside briefly and says to Secretary McIntire:
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           I want the details. Where's the scout she
           knifed?
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           Right here.
                         
          Secretary McIntire snaps his fingers and gives a signal.
          Redford appears.
                         
                          REDFORD
           Field Mate Redford, sir.
                         
                          COMMANDER PIERCE
           (through the oxygen mask)
           What's his condition?
                         
                          SECRETARY MCINTIRE
           He may suffer some limited chronic kidney
           insufficiency. Here's the report.
                         
          Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce a doctor's report.
          Mrs. Bishop snatches it and throws it over her shoulder.
                         
           MRS. BISHOP
           We don't have time for this!
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           She's right!
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           Let's go!
                         
          Social Services turns and starts up the aisle. She stops
          suddenly. Captain Sharp is standing in their path brandishing
          Panagle's walking stick weapon.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Nobody's going anywhere.
                         
          Everyone stops. Captain Sharp locks eyes with Social
          Services. He says in a steely voice:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           He's not getting shock therapy.
           96.
                         
                         
          Social Services looks furious. Her jaw sets. She reaches
          inside her jacket and withdraws a small pad labelled Citation
          Book.
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
           That's it! I'm citing you for gross
           misconduct! You are hereby summoned to
           appear before the board of --
                         
          Captain Sharp looks enraged. He grits his teeth. He reaches
          into his back pocket and withdraws a similar pad labelled
          Boating Violations.
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           I'm writing you up back! Be notified that
           you stand accused of the mistreatment and
                          IMPROPER --
                         
                          SOCIAL SERVICES
                          (SCREAMING)
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
                          (SCREAMING)
           I won't let you do it!
                         
                          REDFORD
                          (SCREAMING)
           Look!
                         
          Everyone looks. Redford is standing on a pew with his arm
          stretched out pointing up at the choir loft in amazement. The
          troop is there, but Sam's and Suzy's seats are empty.
                         
          There is a flash, a bang, and all the lights in the room go
          out at once. People gasp. Candles flicker alight on
          candlesticks. A back-up generator kicks into gear, humming,
          and the room fills with a new, different light.
                         
          Captain Sharp says to himself:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           They're gone.
                         
           MR. BISHOP
                          (CONFUSED)
           Who?
                         
           MRS. BISHOP

           They're here?
                         
          Captain Sharp strides down the aisle. He shouts up to Skotak:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Where'd they go? Answer me!
                         
          Skotak hesitates. He and the rest of the troop all look up to
          a small, rickety, attic door. It is slightly ajar above a
          long, narrow ladder behind the pipes of the organ.
                         
          Captain Sharp bolts up the steps. Everyone follows him,
          running.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT
                         
          The storm rages. Captain Sharp opens a trap door onto the
          high eaves. Faces appear in numerous windows below, looking
          up. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop poke their heads out behind Captain
          Sharp. On the far end of the rooftop, Sam and Suzy huddle
          together at the base of the high steeple.
                         
          Captain Sharp stares up at Sam and Suzy, dumbstruck.
                         
          Sam and Suzy quickly start climbing a rusty gutter up the
          side of the steeple. Captain Sharp looks astonished. He
                         HOLLERS:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Halt! Stop!
                         
          Sam and Suzy continue to climb. Captain Sharp shouts back to
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop over the roaring wind:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Stay there!
                         
          Scout Master Ward appears and thrusts out the coil of rope.
          He yells to Captain Sharp:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Take this!
           98.
                         
                         
          Captain Sharp throws the rope over his shoulder and advances.
          Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both crawl out after him, but Scout
          Master Ward pulls them back. Mr. Bishop looks to Mrs. Bishop.
          They are both terrified and helpless. They hold on to each
          other tightly.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Captain Sharp tight-rope-walking along the edge of the
          slippery roof with his arms stretched out sideways,
          balancing. He army-crawls up steep slate shingles and reaches
          the bottom of the steeple. He looks up. Sam and Suzy have
          arrived at the top. They inch away sideways around a ledge
          and disappear to the other side. Captain Sharp's voice
                         STRAINS:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Where you going? What are you doing? Come
           down!
                         
          Captain Sharp rubs his eyes. He knots one end of the rope
          around his waist and ties the other to a pipe at the foot of
          the gutter. He pulls the rope tight, presses his foot on the
          wall, and gets ready to start climbing -- then stops
          suddenly. He hesitates. He pulls the walkie-talkie off his
          belt and yells into it:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Social Services? Do you read me? Over!

          Sam and Suzy at the top of the steeple standing with their
          backs against a painted cross. They look out.
                         
          The entire church has become an island. The cemetery is under
          water, and the circling streets are fast rivers. Suzy turns
          to Sam. They both appear relatively calm.
                         
                          SUZY
           We might have to swim for it.

           I don't know, but if it's too shallow,
           we'll break our necks, anyway. Hang onto
           me.
                         
                          SAM
           OK.

          Master Ward. Mr. Bishop's eyes widen. He turns quickly to
          Mrs. Bishop. She nods, energized. Mr. Bishop grabs Scout
          Master Ward's walkie-talkie and shouts forcefully:
                         
           MR. BISHOP

           they capture us, and we never see each
           other again anymore -- thank you for
           marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you,
           Suzy.
                         
          Suzy looks deeply moved. She kisses Sam. A little electric
          zap crackles at their lips. Suzy's eyes widen.
                         
                          SUZY
           I think you've still got lightning in

           Let's jump.
                         
          Sam and Suzy look down at the water again. Captain Sharp's
          voice screams from off-screen:
                         
           CAPTAIN SHARP (O.S.)
           No!
                         
          Sam and Suzy recoil. Captain Sharp appears, clinging to the
          corner of the ledge. He shouts:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Goddammit!
                         
          Sam and Suzy retreat slightly. Captain Sharps waves his hands
          in surrender. He yells into the walkie-talkie:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP
           Tell him! Over!
                         
          Captain Sharp holds out the walkie-talkie. Social Services
          voice comes over the scratchy speaker once more. She shouts:

           What do you think, pal?
                         
          Tears stream down Sam's cheeks in the rain. He looks to Suzy.
          She nods. She holds Sam's hand, and Sam reaches out to take
          Captain Sharp's. Captain Sharp says into the walkie-talkie:
                         
                          CAPTAIN SHARP

          there is a second, brighter flash followed by a much louder
          bang and then a terrible, thunderous, ripping explosion. The
          lights go out again. Everyone screams.
                         
          EXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT
                         
          Scout Master Ward, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop, and Social Services
          stare with their mouths open in frozen horror. The entire
          steeple has disappeared. Only a twisted stump remains. Off
          the edge of the roof, at the end of the rope, dangling in the
          rain, Captain Sharp hangs swinging with Sam's hand in his
          fist and Suzy's in Sam's. Voices shout in a panic above. Sam
          and Suzy look up at Captain Sharp. He says to them evenly,
          swaying above the rushing water:

          Scout Master Ward says into the microphone:
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Scout Master's log. October tenth.
           Reconstruction continues increasingly
           ahead of schedule, which I attribute to a
           particularly robust esprit de corps among
           the troop. The latrine, however,
           continues to present --
                         
          Scout Master Ward notices Skotak and a young boy with glasses
          standing in the doorway. He says, off-mic:
           103.
                         
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           Is this the new recruit?
                         
                          SKOTAK
           Yes, sir.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
           What's his rank?
                         
                          SKOTAK
           He doesn't have one.
                         
           SCOUT MASTER WARD
                          (ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
           Pigeon Scout! Let's get you a patch.
                         
          Scout Master Ward presses stop on his tape recorder and leads
          Skotak and the young boy out of the tent. The narrator
                         CONTINUES:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           The coastal areas of New Penzance were
           battered and changed forever.
                         
                         INSERT:
                         
          The narrator's nautical chart. The cove is no longer
          identified.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet was erased from the
           map.
                         
          EXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY
                         
          One year later. The sky is blue. Wildflowers grow in the tall
          grass. The narrator, now in shirtsleeves, concludes:
                         
                          NARRATOR
           But harvest yields the following autumn
           far exceeded any previously recorded, and
           the quality of the crops was said to be
           extraordinary.
                         
          The narrator lingers for a moment, looking into the camera --
          then turns away and walks down the hillside.
                         
          INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
                         
          The landing at the top of the staircase. The portable record
          player sits on the braided rug with the turntable spinning. A
          child's voice says over the speaker:
           104.
                         
                         
           RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
           So you see, the composer Benjamin Britten
           has taken the whole orchestra apart. Now
           he puts it back together again in a
           fugue.
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy lie on the floor on their stomachs,
          propped up with their chins on their fists. They listen.
                         
          Suzy sits in a small armchair reading a book called The
          Return of Auntie Lorraine. There is an illustration on the
          cover of a leathery, old woman and a girl with a pony-tail
          looking together into a crystal ball. The kitten scratches at
          Suzy's feet.
                         
          Sam sits on a stool painting a picture at the small easel. He
          wears a miniature version of Captain Sharp's short-sleeved
          uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap.
                         
          Mrs. Bishop's amplified voice booms from the bottom of the
                         STAIRS:
                         
           MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Suzy? Lionel, Murray, Rudy! Dinner!
                         
          Sam starts. Lionel, Murray, and Rudy look up from the record
          player. Suzy is impassive. Mr. Bishop's voice takes over the
                         MEGAPHONE:
                         
           MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
           Don't make us ask twice!
                         
          Lionel, Murray, and Rudy jump to their feet and race down the
          stairs. Sam dashes to the window. He opens it, climbs out,
          and disappears. Suzy closes her book and rises to her feet.
          Sam's head pokes back up from below. He and Suzy lock eyes.
                         
          Sam smiles. He whispers to Suzy urgently:
                         
                          SAM
           See you tomorrow.
                         
          Suzy smiles back. Sam ducks away. Suzy goes over to the
          window and looks out with her binoculars.
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          A binocular shot of Sam dropping to the ground and running
          across the back lawn, into the trees. He comes out on the
          dirt road where Captain Sharp waits, sitting on the hood of
          his station wagon, smoking a cigarette. They both get into
          the car and drive off.
           105.
                         
                         
          Suzy lowers the binoculars. She pauses in front of the easel
          and looks at the picture. She walks quietly away down the
          stairs. The kitten follows her. The record continues to play
          on the empty landing.
                         
          The camera moves in toward Sam's painting on the easel. It is
          a watercolor landscape of Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. The tent is
          pitched on the beach, and Sam's and Suzy's clothes hang on
          the clothesline. Written in the sand with seashells just at
          the water's edge are the words:

               FADE IN:

               INT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY

               Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on 
               end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end 
               in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.

               We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products 
               calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is 
               November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been 
               penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica 
               counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter, 
               in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat 
               red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE 
               WHITE BACKGROUND.

                                        MOONSTRUCK

               Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low 
               TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.

                                     ZITO'S VOICE
                              (barely discernable)
                         Three times they cancel the order 
                         with me, and three times they come 
                         back. Who they kidding? They cheap, 
                         cheap, cheap. The other bread they 
                         get is no good. They save pennies. 
                         Everybody complain and they come 
                         back. "Zito, your bread is the best." 
                         They're like children stupid in school 
                         who cannot learn. The water. It's 
                         the water. You buy bread in Hoboken, 
                         you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water 
                         is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask 
                         your father. He knows.

               During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE 
               DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently 
               with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the 
               pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.

               NOW WE SEE ZITO

               He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's 
               early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, 
               so he's a little tired and disgruntled.

                                     ZITO
                         You want me to make you some coffee?

               NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME

               She's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is 
               Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked 
               with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes 
               of a dark color.

                                     LORETTA
                         What d'you know about coffee? Gimme 
                         a loaf of bread.

               EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY

               Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping 
               satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She 
               moves off briskly.

               EXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY

               This is a little Italian funeral parlor.

               INT. THE "WAKE" ROOM"

               A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes, 
               many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front, 
               the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and 
               formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We 
               discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises.

               She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over 
               and says.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         He looks great.

                                     RUBY
                         That Al Conti is a genius.

               INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR

               First WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO 
               CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE.

                                     CONTI'S VOICE
                         I am a genius.

               The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half 
               cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming 
               mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's 
               tabulations.

                                     LORETTA'S VOICE
                         If you're such an artistic genius, 
                         why can't you keep track of your 
                         receipts? How am I going to do your 
                         income tax?

                                     CONTI'S VOICE
                         I am an artistic genius.

               The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta 
               sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of 
               coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering 
               figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger.

                                     LORETTA
                         If you're an artistic genius, how 
                         come you got butter on your tie?

               He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss.

                                     LORETTA
                         Give it here. I'll give you this, 
                         Al, you make good coffee.

               She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has 
               taken off, and slams the ledger shut.

               INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL

               We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They 
               are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall 
               starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes 
               are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is 
               ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. 
               He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, 
               heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that 
               Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a 
               ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. 
               After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something 
               to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and

               INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

               WE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.

               Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping 
               block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits, 
               unskinned.

               INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY

               A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the 
               FLORIST'S VOICE.

                                     FLORIST'S VOICE
                         Red roses. Very romantic. The man 
                         who sends these knows what he's doing.

               Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the 
               box of roses.

                                     LORETTA
                         The man who sends those spends a lot 
                         of money on something that ends up 
                         in the garbage can.

               The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.

                                     FLORIST
                         I'm glad everybody ain't like you, 
                         Loretta. I'd be outta business.

                                     LORETTA
                         Without me, you'd be out of business. 
                         I like flowers.

               She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first 
               time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of 
               her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red 
               rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.

               EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A red neon sign hangs in the window.

               It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A 
               YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested 
               in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.

               INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

               White tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the 
               door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That's because 
               they're all related. The place is about half full, and bustles 
               along pleasantly.

               MUSIC

               A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.

               MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.

               They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is 
               Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is 
               impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens 
               to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a 
               pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a 
               mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is 
               Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked 
               with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and 
               high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.

               Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who 
               hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.

               Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she 
               watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.

               BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their 
               order.

                                     BOBO
                         Are you ready?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

                                     BOBO
                         Very good, Mr. Johnny.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         We will both have the Salad Ticino.

                                     BOBO
                         Uh-huh

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         And I'll have the special fish.

                                     LORETTA
                         You don't want the fish.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         No?

                                     LORETTA
                         It's the oily fish tonight. Not before 
                         the plane ride.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Maybe you're right.

                                     LORETTA
                         Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, 
                         too.

                                     BOBO
                         Yes, Miss Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                              (to Mr. Johnny)
                         That will give you a base. For your 
                         stomach. You eat that oily fish, you 
                         go up in the air, halfway to Sicily 
                         you'll be green and your hands will 
                         be sweating.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                              (smiles)
                         You look after me.

               They HEAR a distinguished MAN'S VOICE rise out of the babble.

               They turn and look. The man's name is PERRY.

               PERRY AND PATRICIA FROM LORETTA'S POV

               Perry is a university professor. PATRICIA is his 
               girlfriend/student. He's in his 50's. She's about 25 years 
               younger. She's getting her coat on in a huff.

                                     PERRY
                         Patricia, please don't go!

                                     PATRICIA
                         What do you think I am, a talking 
                         dog?

                                     PERRY
                         I was just making a point about the 
                         way you said... the way you stated 
                         your aspirations.

                                     PATRICIA
                         You can kiss my aspirations! 
                         Professor!

               She storms out, leaving Perry muttering to himself.

                                     PERRY
                         Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever. 
                         The height of cleverness. Waiter!

               An abnormally SHY WAITER stops.

                                     SHY WAITER
                         Yes?

                                     PERRY
                         Could you do away with her dinner, 
                         and any evidence of her, and bring 
                         me an big glass of vodka?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         But absolutely!

               THE SHY WAITER begins to efficiently clear.

               MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA EXCHANGE A GLANCE

               Mr. Johnny is amused. Bobo serves them their salad.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         A man who can't control his woman is 
                         funny.

                                     LORETTA
                         She was too young for him.

               Mr. Johnny considers this a point well taken.

               BOBO AND HIS NEPHEW EDDIE STAND NEAR THE KITCHEN

               Which can be seen through a serving window. They can look 
               out over the restaurant tables. Bobo is melancholy and 
               philosophical. EDDIE is a young waiter.

                                     EDDIE
                         What'samatter, Uncle Bobo?

                                     BOBO
                         Tonight Mr. Johnny's gonna propose 
                         marriage.

                                     EDDIE
                         How you know that?

                                     BOBO
                         He arranged it with me. When he asks 
                         her, then he'll wave to me and I'll 
                         bring champagne. Good bachelor 
                         customer for twenty years. But who 
                         knows? Maybe he'll lose courage.

                                     EDDIE
                         Heavy duty stuff.

               PERRY, FEELING NO PAIN, COLLARS THE SHY WAITER

               He holds out his empty glass.

                                     PERRY
                         Can I get another one of these?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         Definitely!

               Perry takes his arm.

                                     PERRY
                         May I presume to ask you a question?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         Sure!

                                     PERRY
                         Do you have a girlfriend?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         I am alone in the world.

               Perry lets go of his arm. He and the Shy Waiter commiserate 
               a moment. Then, wordlessly, the Shy Waiter goes.

                                     PERRY
                         That's very sad.

               BOBO IS CLEARING THE REMAINS OF MR. JOHNNY'S DINNER. He's 
               already cleared Loretta's.

                                     BOBO
                         How's things?

                                     LORETTA
                         Fine, Bobo. We'll take the check.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         No, I want to see the dessert cart.

                                     BOBO
                         Very good.

               Bobo goes. Loretta is surprised.

                                     LORETTA
                         You never have dessert.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Never is a long time.

               Mr. Johnny is uneasy. He massages his head.

                                     LORETTA
                         What's the matter?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         My scalp is not getting enough blood 
                         sometimes.

               Loretta looks at him strangely. Bobo rolls up the dessert 
               cart. WE SEE Loretta and Mr. Johnny through the frame of the 
               dessert cart. They turn and look at the desserts.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Have Something.

                                     LORETTA
                         I shouldn't.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Will you marry me?

                                     LORETTA
                         What?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Will you marry me?

                                     LORETTA
                         Bobo, take the cart away.

               He does.

                                     LORETTA
                              (continuing)
                         Are you proposing marriage to me?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Yes?

                                     LORETTA
                         You know I was married and that my 
                         husband died. But what you don't 
                         know is I think he and I had Bad 
                         Luck.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         What do you mean?

                                     LORETTA
                         We got married at the City Hall and 
                         I think it gave bad luck the whole 
                         marriage.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't understand.

                                     LORETTA
                         Right from the start we didn't do it 
                         right. Could you kneel down?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         On the floor?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yes, on the floor.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         This is a good suit.

                                     LORETTA
                         I helped you buy it. It came with 
                         two pairs of pants. It's for luck, 
                         Johnny. When you propose marriage to 
                         a woman, you should kneel down.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Alright.

               Mr. Johnny slowly gets out of his chair. There's not enough 
               room for him to kneel down. He has to ask two off-duty PRO 
               WRESTLERS who are eating dinner to move their chairs. They 
               do so with bemused expressions. Their names are BOB and MOOK.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                              (at a loss)
                         The ring?

               They are deadpan mugs.

                              (to Mr. Johnny)
                         A ring. That's right.

                                     MOOK
                         I woulda sprung for a ring if it was 
                         me.

                         You could use your pinky ring.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I like this ring.

                                     LORETTA
                         You propose to a woman you should 
                         offer her a ring of engagement.

               Mr. Johnny takes off the ring and holds it out to her.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Loretta. Loretta Castorini Clark. On 
                         my knees. In front of all these 
                         people. Will you marry me?

               She meekly accepts the ring from him and takes his hands.

                                     LORETTA
                         Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony 
                         Cammareri. I will marry you. I will 
                         be your wife.

               Mr. Johnny slowly stands up, brushes off his knees. The 
               restaurant has fallen utterly silent. Loretta smiles. They 
               embrace. Loretta kisses him quickly.

               A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, SUSAN, IS MAUDLIN FROM THE PROPOSAL

               Bobo stands very near her table. She is about to applaud the 
               proposal. She brings her hands together. Bobo's hand flashes 
               out and neatly captures her hands before they can part again. 
               The single sound dies abruptly in the silent room.

               LORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY

               Mr. Johnny is in control now. He looks around once, regally.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Bobo! The check!

                         I feel like I have just witnessed a

               The Shy Waiter sits down at Perry's table.

                         When I was twenty-seven years old, 
                         in Jersey City, I asked a woman to 
                         marry me. She had red hair. She 
                         smelled a jasmine. She wore black 
                         shoes with pointy white tips.

                         She didn't hear me. She asked me to 
                         repeat, so she could understand what 
                         I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. 
                         Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.

               MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA

               He's helping her on with her coat.

                         What time is it?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Seven-thirty.

                         So we'll pick up the car, we'll make 
                         the plane in plenty of time.

               Mr. Johnny puts on his coat.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         My mother will be happy I'm getting 
                         married.

               Bobo approaches with the bucket of champagne. He's flustered.

                         I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. 
                         Johnny.

                         I forgot to wave. We'll have it at

                         My mother is dying. When she is dead, 
                         I'll come back and we'll be married.

                         Must it be so definite? Can't we 
                         just say that we will be married 
                         when I get back?

                         the whole wedding or we will have 
                         Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be

                         I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll 
                         take care of the whole thing. All

               begins to move. Red lights are flashing.

               AN OLD ITALIAN CRONE IS LOOKING OUT THE TERMINAL WINDOW

               In the background we see the accordion like ramp that was 
               loading to the departing aircraft, slowly fold up. Loretta 
               walks up beside her, and looks out the window, too. The crone 
               is dressed in black and has a black scarf on her head.

               The Crone notices Loretta.

                         I have put a curse on that plane. My 
                         sister is on that plane. I have put 
                         a curse on that plane that it should 
                         explode. Burn on fire and fall into 
                         the sea. Fifty years ago she stole a 
                         man from me. Today she told me that 
                         she didn't even love him. She took 
                         him to feel strong with me. Now she 
                         goes back to Sicily. I have cursed 
                         her that the green Atlantic water 
                         should swallow her up.

               Loretta walks out.

                         You know what I see in you, Lotte?

               Lotte, caught off-guard, blushes.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               It's a big, old eccentric, three-story corner house. To one 
               side, it's got a qated arch that leads to an inner courtyard 
               where three cars could park. It's got two cast-iron balconies. 
               About a third of the windows in the house are lit.

               From within can be HEARD the faint strains of VICKI CARR 
               SINGING and one DOG BARKING. Loretta appears, carrying 
               champagne, approaches the front door, unlocks it, and goes 
               in.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

               MUSIC

               VICKI CARR is SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM."

               The front hall is typical of big old brownstones. There's a 
               big old oak coat rack with a built-in mirror and an umbrella 
               stand. There are several coats hanging from it. The floor is 
               littered with boots. There's also a side table.

               On the table is a large cut-glass bowl filled with a couple 
               of pounds of hard candy.

               Loretta comes in and takes off her coat. A single MAD HOWL 
               is HEARD, followed by a PANDEMONIUM OF BARKING. FIVE DOGS 
               charge into the hall to greet Loretta. They are totally 
               cockeyed, crackpot mutts. Their names are JUDAS, LUCY, LEO 
               FATBOY, AND JONES.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hello, boys and girls. Guess what 
                         happened to me?

               The VOICE of the OLD MAN is heard calling out from upstairs.

                                     OLD MAN'S VOICE
                         How long must I wait? Quanto tempo 
                         devo aspettare?

               The Five Dogs turn away from Loretta and charge up the stairs 
               toward the voice. Loretta walks toward the living room.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               This is the source of the Vicki Carr song, which is just 
               ending. COSMO CASTORINI, Loretta's father is just turning 
               off the old stereo. He is a powerful man, about 65, with a 
               huge shock of white hair and gold wire glasses. He's wearing 
               a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas, and royal blue 
               slippers. The room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture, 
               once grand, now threadbare; shawls and doilies cover holes 
               in failing fabric. There's a fireplace containing a dying 
               fire. Cosmo's wing chair, with his newspaper on it, is beside 
               a lit fringed lamp. Cosmo sees Loretta as she comes in.

                                     COSMO
                         Hi.

               He sits in his chair and puts his feet up on an old 
               needlepoint ottoman. He starts to read the paper.

                                     LORETTA
                         Where's Ma?

                                     COSMO
                         Bed.

                                     LORETTA
                         You're not sleepy?

                                     COSMO
                         I can't sleep anymore. It's too much 
                         like death.

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop, I got news.

               Cosmo puts down the paper and takes his feet off the ottoman.

                                     COSMO
                         Alright. Let's go in the kitchen.

               Cosmo gets up and heads for the kitchen. He hums and continues 
               as Loretta opens champagne.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Loretta and Cosmo sit at the kitchen table. It's a big tin 
               table with a black-and-white design. Loretta has put two old- 
               fashioned champagne glasses on the table, the split of 
               champagne, a bag of sugar cubes, and a bottle of bitters.

               She pours the champagne, drops a little lump of sugar into 
               each glass, and adds a dash of bitters. She hands one of the 
               drinks to Cosmo.

                                     LORETTA

                         You look tired.

                                     COSMO
                         What's your news?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm getting married.

                                     LORETTA
                         Yeah.

                                     COSMO
                         You did this once it didn't work 
                         out.

                                     LORETTA
                         The guy died.

                                     LORETTA
                         He got hit by a bus.

                                     COSMO
                         No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been 
                         married fifty-two years an nobody 
                         died. You were married, what, two 
                         years, and somebody is dead. Don't 
                         get married again, Loretta. It don't 
                         work out for you. Who's the man?

                                     LORETTA
                         Johnny Cammareri.

                                     COSMO
                         Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he 
                         here with you telling me?

                                     LORETTA
                         He's flying to Sicily. His mother's 
                         dying.

                                     COSMO
                         More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, 
                         Loretta. I don't like his lips. When 
                         he smiles I can't see his teeth. 
                         When will you do it?

                                     LORETTA
                         In a month.

                                     COSMO
                         I won't come.

                                     LORETTA
                         You've got to come. You've got to 
                         give me away.

                                     COSMO
                         I didn't give you away the first 
                         time.

                                     LORETTA
                         And maybe that's why I had the Bad 
                         Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and 
                         I got married in a church, in a 
                         wedding dress, instead of at the 
                         City Hall with strangers standing 
                         outside the door, maybe then I 
                         wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.

                                     COSMO
                         Maybe.

                                     LORETTA
                         I didn't have no wedding cake, no 
                         reception or nothing. Johnny got 
                         down on his knees and proposed to me 
                         at The Grand Ticino.

                         Yeah.

                                     COSMO
                         That don't sound like Johnny. Where's 
                         the ring?

               Loretta shows it.

               Cosmo examines it.

                                     LORETTA
                         Here.

                         It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. 
                         It's a man's ring.

                                     LORETTA
                         It's temporary.

                                     COSMO
                         Everything is temporary. That don't 
                         excuse nothing.

                         So you'll come to the wedding, right?

                         Let's go tell your Mother.

               She smiles. He doesn't. They rise from the table.

               THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DARKENED MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The door to the hall opens, and the light from without dimly 
               illuminates a massive four-poster bed. Cosmo enters, followed 
               by Loretta. He speaks into the dark a calm and measured 
               summons.

                                     COSMO
                         Rose. Rose. Rose. Rose.

               A lamp is switched on by the bed. By ROSE. Rose is in her 
               60'S, and is very, very beautiful. Her abundant white tresses 
               frame a face of porcelain delicacy.

               She's wearing an old and richly beautiful white nightgown.

                                     ROSE

               Cosmo goes and sits on the bed.

                         I don't like him.

                         You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. 
                         Do you love him, Loretta?

                         you crazy cause they know they can. 
                         But you like him?

                         have a big church wedding, Ma. And a 
                         reception.

                                     ROSE
                         And who's gonna pay for that?

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop.

               Rose starts laughing.

                         Father of the bride pays.

               Cosmo walks out.

                         just cheap, Cosmo.

               Cosmo shouts from the stairs.

                                     COSMO
                         I won't pay for nothing.

                         He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks 
                         if he holds on to his money, he will 
                         never die.

               VICKI CARR, SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM", starts playing. Rose 
               looks weary.

                                     ROSE
                         Now he's gonna play that damn Vicki 
                         Carr record. And then when he comes 
                         to bed, he won't touch me.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - MORNING

               The first golden rays of sunlight touch the great old house.

               The front door opens. Close shot of dogs coming into camera 
               as door opens. The OLD MAN comes out. The Old Man, who is 
               Cosmo's father, is 83 years old. He is taking the Five Dogs 
               out for their morning walk. He has their five leashes bundled 
               in one hand. In the other hand, even though it is a cloudless 
               November morning, he open black umbrella. He walks off down 
               the block with the dogs.

               EXT. A SMALL CITY PARK SURROUNDED BY HURRICANE FENCE - DAY

               The Old Man and the Five Dogs appear and enter the park. He 
               approaches a park bench where FELIX and LUCY are already 
               sitting. Felix and Lucy are about the same age as the Old 
               Man. They each have a well-behaved DOG. When the Old Man 
               sits down, he lets the Five Dogs go. The Dogs run off, BARKING 
               like mad.

                                     FELIX
                         It's wrong to just let them go.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (ignoring Felix)
                         Good morning, Lucy.

                                     LUCY
                         Good morning.

                                     FELIX
                         They run around, they mess up the 
                         whole park.

                                     OLD MAN
                         What do you want me to do? Pick up 
                         after five dogs? I'm eighty-three 
                         years old. God in his heaven 
                         understands that I cannot pick up 
                         after five dogs.

                                     FELIX
                         You have too many dogs.

               The dogs can be HEARD in the distance. It sounds like they're 
               killing each other.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (goes back to ignoring 
                              Felix)
                         Lucy. There are big things going on 
                         in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, 
                         the only daughter of my son Cosmo, 
                         has engaged herself to be married a 
                         second time.

                                     LUCY
                         I have heard that Johnny Cammareri 
                         got down on his knees in The Grand 
                         Ticino and proposed to her.

                                     OLD MAN
                         My son does not like this Johnny 
                         Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.

                                     FELIX
                         You should have one dog. Like Lucy. 
                         Like me. I wish I hadda gun. If I 
                         hadda gun, I would shoot four of 
                         your dogs.

               The Old Man makes a low, threatening noise.

                                     LUCY
                         Don't fight.

                                     OLD MAN
                         My granddaughter wants my son to pay 
                         for the wedding. But he does not 
                         want to pay.

                                     LUCY
                         He should pay.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I don't know.

                                     LUCY
                         He owes her a wedding from the first 
                         time when there was none.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked 
                         my advice. If he asks my advice, I 
                         don't know what I will say.

               The SOUND of the DOGS becomes intense again.

                                     FELIX
                         I won't have to shoot those dogs. 
                         They will kill each other.

                                     OLD MAN
                         You think so, huh, Stupid? Those 
                         dogs love each other.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

               The gates in the big archway are opened from the inside.

               It's Cosmo. He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an 
               overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black 
               Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he 
               gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and 
               goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man 
               approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.

               The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.

               Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and 
               son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective 
               door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the 
               same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.

               Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears 
               within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               A RED-HOT, WELL-SEASONED CAST IRON FRYING PAN

               Receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of 
               satisfaction. A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around 
               until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread 
               with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.

               Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula 
               flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the 
               cooked side.

               Two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in 
               the bread.

               The circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula, 
               scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs.

               A WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash 
               of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results 
               from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates.

               Now WE SEE that Loretta is just finishing setting the tin 
               table for two. In the b.g., Rose is turning away from the 
               big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled 
               coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes 
               toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a 
               nice old apron over a blue housedress. She's thoughtful.

               As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work 
               shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As 
               Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta, 
               who's at the stove.

                                     ROSE
                         Will you live here?

                                     LORETTA
                         No.

                                     ROSE
                         Why not?

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop don't like Johnny.

               Loretta returns with the coffeepot to the table, and pours.

               Then she takes the pot back to the stove.

                                     ROSE
                         So we'll sell the house.

                                     LORETTA
                         I got married before, you didn't 
                         sell.

               Loretta comes to the table. They sit down to breakfast.

                                     ROSE
                         Grandma was still alive. Chiro was 
                         still home going to school. Now he's 
                         married and gone to Florida. If you 
                         and Johnny moved in, had a baby...

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm thirty-seven years old.

                                     ROSE
                         What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro 
                         after I was thirty-seven. It ain't 
                         over till it's over.

                                     LORETTA
                         Johnny has a big apartment. We'll 
                         live there.

                                     ROSE
                         And we'll sell the house.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the 
                         house. But Pop don't like Johnny.

                                     ROSE
                         No. He don't.

               The WALL PHONE in the kitchen RINGS. Loretta goes and answers 
               it.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hello? Yea, this is Loretta Castorini - 
                         yeah. Is that you Johnny?

               INT. A DARKENED BEDROOM IN PALERMO - DAY

               Mr. Johnny is calling on an old European-style phone. In the 
               b.g. is the sickbed. In the sickbed lies VESTA, Mr. Johnny's 
               mother, her grey hair spread out on a golden pillow.

               By the bed are THREE MOURNERS, old crones dressed in black.

               One clutches a missal, the other two clutch rosaries. All 
               three are grieving in a steady low wordless whine. Mr. Johnny 
               speaks into the phone in a confidential manner. There is 
               some long-distance CRACKLE.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the 
                         deathbed of my mother.

               LORETTA ON THE PHONE

                                     LORETTA
                         How was your plane ride?

               MR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         The waitresses were very nice.
                              (glances over at his 
                              mother)
                         My mother is slipping away.

               LORETTA ON THE PHONE

                                     VESTA
                              (calling to the Heavens)
                         Quanto tempo devo aspettare?
                              (now she aims more at 
                              Johnny)
                         How long must I wait?!

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I can't talk long.

                                     LORETTA
                         Have you told her we're getting 
                         married?

               MR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment 
                         when she's peaceful.

               We HEAR Loretta's VOICE over his receiver.

                                     LORETTA'S VOICE
                         Just don't wait until she's dead.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Have you called my brother?

                                     LORETTA'S VOICE
                         Not yet.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Will you do it today? Call him, make 
                         him come to the wedding. Five years 
                         is too long for bad blood between 
                         brothers. Nothing can replace your 
                         family. I see that now.

               LORETTA ON THE PHONE

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright. I'll call him. Today. Listen, 
                         Johnny. Call me after you tell your 
                         mother. Alright? Alright. And don't 
                         stand directly under the sun. You've 
                         got your hat, use your hat. Alright. 
                         Bye-bye.

               Loretta hangs up the phone. She thinks. Rose speaks from the 
               table, where she's still sitting.

                                     ROSE
                         How's the mother?

                                     LORETTA
                         She's dying. But I could still hear 
                         her big mouth.

                                     ROSE
                         Did he tell her?

                                     LORETTA
                         Not yet. That old lady makes him 
                         sweat.
                              (to herself)
                         Where's that card?

               Rose gets up and takes the dishes to the sink, Loretta fishes 
               in her pocket and comes out with the business card Mr. Johnny 
               gave her. She dials the number.

                                     ROSE
                         Who Are you calling?

               INT. CAMMARERI PASTRY SHOP - DAY

               (INTERCUT W/LORETTA IN KITCHEN)

               CHRISSY, a woman with a Queens accent, answers.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Cammareri's Bake Shop.

                                     LORETTA
                         Is Ronny there?

                                     CHRISSY
                         Hold on.
                              (yells into intercom)
                         Ronny, the phone!

               INT. CAMMARERI PASTRY SHOP - OVEN ROOM - DAY

               (INTERCUT W/LORETTA IN KITCHEN)

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah, this is Ronny.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm calling for your brother Johnny. 
                         He's getting married and he wants 
                         you to come.

               There's a long pause. Ronny's voice returns, hoarse with 
               emotion.

                                     RONNY
                         Why didn't he call himself?

                                     LORETTA
                         He's in Palermo.

                                     RONNY
                         What's wrong can never be made right.
                              (hangs up phone)

                                     LORETTA
                         Let me come and talk to you.

               Loretta hangs up the phone. She looks at the card again, 
               makes a decision and pockets the card.

               THE TOWNHOUSE/INT. THE BUICK - DAY

               As Cosmo drives away. He's in a very good mood. He's 
               WHISTLING. He laughs to himself.

               CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

               And the street in front of it. Loretta arrives. She's wearing 
               a long, navy-blue cloth coat and a knit hat. She looks up at 
               the sign and at the business card in her hand, and enters 
               the shop.

               INT. CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

               It's a nice Italian bake shop. Three Italian women, CHRISSY, 
               BARBARA, and MA wait on THREE WOMEN SHOPPERS at the counter.

               CHRISSY and BARBARA are in their late 20's or early 30's; MA 
               is old, old. Loretta comes in and speaks to CHRISSY.

                                     LORETTA
                         Is Ronny Cammareri here?

                                     CHRISSY
                         He down at the ovens. What do you 
                         want?

                                     LORETTA
                         I would like to speak to him.

               EXT. CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

               Chrissy comes out and Loretta follows. They walk around to 
               an outdoor staircase that descends into the sidewalk. Chrissy 
               shouts down.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Hey, RONNY.

               EXT. AN OLD DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE - DAY

               The door slides open, revealing ROCCO, a baker missing a few 
               teeth. He is surrounded by bread.

                                     ROCCO
                         What!

                                     CHRISSY'S VOICE
                         Somebody to see Ronny.

               Rocco slides back the door all the way. Chrissy and Loretta 
               make their way past him. He slides the door three quarters 
               shut behind them.

               INT. THE BASEMENT OVEN ROOM - DAY

               There are two coal-fired ovens, one at either end of the 
               room. There is a large wooden table roughly center. And 
               various pieces of baking equipment, dough-mixers, etc., 
               scattered willy-nilly. And everywhere there is bread.

               PIETRO, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long 
               wooden spatula. RONNY is working at the other oven.

               Actually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking 
               bread and burning coals. He's dressed in black jeans streaked 
               with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves, 
               and around his neck, a red handkerchief. He is black-haired, 
               handsome and intense.

                                     ROCCO
                         Ronny!

                                     RONNY
                         What!

                                     ROCCO
                         Somebody here to see you.

               Ronny turns and takes in Loretta.

                                     RONNY
                         Have you come from my brother?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yes.

                                     RONNY
                         Why?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm going to marry him.

                                     RONNY
                         You are going to marry my brother?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yes. Do you want...

                                     RONNY
                         I have no life.

                                     LORETTA
                         Excuse me.

                                     RONNY
                         I have no life. My brother Johnny 
                         took my life from me.

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't understand.

               Everything in the oven room has stopped and everyone is 
               watching.

                                     RONNY
                         And now he's getting married. He has 
                         his, he's getting his. And he wants 
                         me to come? What is life?

               He picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven.

                                     LORETTA
                         I didn't come here to upset you.

               Ronny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula, 
               turns them around, and slides them back in.

                                     RONNY
                         They say bread is life. So I bake 
                         bread, bread, bread.
                              (He's picking up loaves 
                              of bread from one of 
                              the boxes on the 
                              floor, and casually 
                              tossing them across 
                              the room.)
                         And the years go by! By! By! And I 
                         sweat and shovel this stinking dough 
                         in and outta this hot hole in the 
                         wall and I should be so happy, huh, 
                         sweetheart? You want me to come to 
                         the wedding of my brother Johnny?!! 
                         Where is my wedding? Chrissy! Over 
                         by the wall! Gimme the big knife!

                                     CHRISSY
                         No, Ronny!

               Barbara appears in the doorway and comes down the stairs 
               into the room.

                                     RONNY
                         Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut 
                         my throat!

                                     LORETTA
                         Maybe I should come back another 
                         time.

                                     RONNY
                         No, I want you to see this! I want 
                         you to watch me kill myself so you 
                         can tell my brother on his wedding 
                         day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!

                                     CHRISSY
                         I tell you I won't do it!

                                     RONNY
                              (to Loretta)
                         Do you know about me?

                                     BARBARA
                         Oh, Mr. Cammareri!

                                     RONNY
                         Nothing is anybody's fault, but things 
                         happen.
                              (holds up his left 
                              hand to Loretta)
                         Look.

               He pulls off the glove. The hand is made of wood.

                                     RONNY
                         It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago 
                         I was engaged to be married. Johnny 
                         came in here, he ordered bread from 
                         me. I put it in the slicer and I 
                         talked with him and my hand got caught 
                         cause I wasn't paying attention. The 
                         slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 
                         'cause - when my fiancé saw that I 
                         was maimed, she left me for another 
                         man.

                                     LORETTA
                         That's the bad blood between you and 
                         Johnny?

                                     RONNY
                         That's it.

                                     LORETTA
                         But that wasn't Johnny's fault.

                                     RONNY
                         I don't care! I ain't no freakin 
                         monument to justice! I lost my hand, 
                         I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, 
                         Johnny has his bride! You come in 
                         here and you want me to put away my 
                         heartbreak and forget?

               He goes to the big table, which is floured and covered with 
               bread. He sweeps everything off the tabletop during the next.

                                     RONNY
                         Is it just a matter of time till a 
                         man opens his eyes and gives up his 
                         one dream of happiness? Maybe. Maybe. 
                         All I have... Have you come here, 
                         Stranger, Bride of my Brother, to 
                         take these last few loaves from my 
                         table? Alright. Alright.

               The table is bare. He stares at it blankly. He wanders away, 
               to the back room where the flour sacks are kept. We hear a 
               single sob escape him from that room, and then silence.

               Everyone in the oven room looks after him. Then Chrissy 
               approaches Loretta. She holds the big knife at her side.

                                     CHRISSY
                         This is the most tormented man I 
                         have ever known. I am in love with 
                         this man. He doesn't know that. I 
                         never told him cause he can never 
                         love anybody since he lost his hand 
                         and his girl.

               She holds out the knife.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Here. Why don't you just kill him? 
                         It would be so much more kind than 
                         coming here and inviting him to a 
                         wedding like he'll never have.

               Loretta considers Chrissy, decides what she's going to do, 
               and goes to the flour room.

               INT. OF THE FLOUR ROOM - DAY

               Many 50 lb. bags of flour are stacked under a bare electric 
               bulb. A rough stone staircase opposite is lit by daylight 
               from above. Ronny, quietly distraught, stands leaning by his 
               forehead against a stack of flour. Loretta approaches him. 
               She feels for him.

                                     LORETTA
                         Where you live?

               He points to the stone staircase.

                                     RONNY
                         Upstairs.

               She touches his shoulder.

                                     LORETTA
                         Come on.

               He follows her up the stairs.

               EXT. THE STAIRCASE ENTRANCE ON THE STREET

               Loretta and Ronny emerge. He gestures. They enter the 
               apartment building behind the bakery.

               INT. THE PEACOCK CAFE  DAY

               It's a dark Italian coffee and dessert house. Reproductions 
               of Roman statuary adorn grottos and alcoves. In the back is 
               a glass case displaying various desserts, and behind the 
               case, a big burnished gold cappuccino machine. The place is 
               almost empty.

               MUSIC

               An album of "NEAPOLITAN FOLK SONGS" is PLAYING on the cafe's 
               SOUND SYSTEM.

               The CAMERA TRAVELS along the face of an exposed brick wall, 
               DISCOVERING busts of Romans occasionally, and then IT COMES 
               TO the figure of COSMO. He's sitting at a table which is 
               inset into a nook, so we cannot see who he's with.

               DARK NOOK IN THE CAFE

               At a little table away from prying eyes, Cosmo sits with 
               MONA, his girlfriend. Mona is a pretty but overripe Italian 
               woman in her late forties. She's all done up, and she looks 
               at Cosmo with adoration.

                                     COSMO
                         And then there is copper, which is 
                         the only pipe I use. It costs money. 
                         But it costs money because it saves 
                         money.

                                     MONA
                         And what did they say?

                                     COSMO
                         The man understood me. The woman 
                         wanted to be cheap, but the man saw 
                         that I was right.

                                     MONA
                         You have such a head for knowing. 
                         You know everything.

                                     COSMO
                         I brought you something.

               He takes out a small velvet box and hands it to her.

                                     COSMO
                         It's a present.

               She opens the box. It's a gold bracelet with a pattern of 
               stars and birds.

                                     MONA
                         Oh, Cosmo!

                                     COSMO
                         They are little stars and birds. 
                         Birds fly to the stars, I guess.

               EXT. RONNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               A three-story walk-up above Cammareri's Bakery.

               INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               It's a two-bedroom apartment. The decor reflects Ronny's 
               love of the opera. The furniture is overstuffed, fringed in 
               the colors of Italian passion. But it is all a bit faded, 
               the remains of an old flamboyance. The walls are decorated 
               with opera posters; and over the fireplace there is a painting 
               depicting a scene from "La Boheme": Mimi is standing in the 
               snow. Ronny stares at the picture of Mimi in the La Boheme 
               poster. Loretta comes in from the kitchen and sets down a 
               cup of coffee.

                                     LORETTA
                         You ready for the coffee?

               Loretta moves back into the kitchen. Ronny turns and watches 
               as she walks down the hall.

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta. What's that smell?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm making you a steak.

                                     RONNY
                         You don't have to help me.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know that. I do what I want.

                                     RONNY
                         I like it well done.

                                     LORETTA
                         You'll eat this bloody to feed your 
                         blood.

               INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT -DINING ROOM - DAY

               CU of Ronny's artificial hand, holding a fork stuck in a 
               steak. With his right he is cutting his steak. He switches 
               hands and eats hungrily. Loretta watches.

                                     RONNY
                         This is good. Uhh...

                                     LORETTA
                         Loretta.

                                     RONNY
                         Where'd Johnny find you?

                                     LORETTA
                         He knew my husband who died.

                                     RONNY
                         How'd he die?

                                     LORETTA
                         Bus hit him.

                                     RONNY
                         Fast.

                                     LORETTA
                         Instantaneous.

                                     RONNY
                         When you get engaged?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yesterday.

               Ronny drops his knife and fork and turns away. Loretta is 
               not surprised and does not move.

                                     RONNY
                         Why?

                                     LORETTA
                         Why what?

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know.

                                     LORETTA
                              (smiles)
                         So. Five years ago your hand got cut 
                         off and your woman left you for 
                         another man. No woman since then?

                                     RONNY
                         No.

                                     LORETTA
                         Stupid.

                                     RONNY
                         When your husband get hit by the 
                         bus?

                                     LORETTA
                         Seven years ago.

                                     RONNY
                         How many men since then?

                                     LORETTA
                         Just Johnny.

                                     RONNY
                         Stupid yourself.

                                     LORETTA
                         No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.

                                     RONNY
                         I don't care about Luck, you 
                         understand me? It ain't that.

                                     LORETTA
                         What? Do you think you're the only 
                         one ever shed a tear?

                                     RONNY
                         Why you talking to me?

                                     LORETTA
                         You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving 
                         me a glass of whiskey?

               EXT. STREET NEAR BAKERY - DAY

               SHOT OF COSMO & MONA IN THE BUICK

               The car has just come to a stop. We see Cosmo & Mona kiss.

               She exits car. Cosmo glances around with a slightly guilty 
               look and pulls away.

               LORETTA AND RONNY AT THE TABLE WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY

               Camera is close on Scotch being poured into two glasses.

               Loretta picks up her glass and swallows a healthy dose.

                                     RONNY
                         She was right to leave me.

                                     LORETTA
                         You think so?

                                     RONNY
                         Yes.

                                     LORETTA
                         You really are stupid, you know that.

               Loretta pours herself another shot.

                                     RONNY
                         You don't know nothing about it.

                                     LORETTA
                         I was raised that a girl gets married 
                         young. I didn't get married until I 
                         was twenty-eight. I met a man. I 
                         loved him. I married him. He wanted 
                         to have a baby right away. I said 
                         no. Then he got hit by a bus. No 
                         man. No baby. No nothing! I did not 
                         know that man was a gift I could not 
                         keep. I didn't know... You tell me a 
                         story and you think you know what it 
                         means, but I see what the true story 
                         is, and you can't.
                              (she pours them both 
                              another drink)
                         She didn't leave you! You can't see 
                         what you are. I can see everything. 
                         You are a wolf!

                                     RONNY
                         I'm a wolf?

                                     LORETTA
                         The big part of you has no words and 
                         it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap 
                         for you. She caught you and you could 
                         not get away.
                              (She grabs his wooden 
                              hand)
                         So you chewed off your foot! That 
                         was the price you had to pay to be 
                         free.
                              (throws his hand down)
                         Johnny had nothing to do with it. 
                         You did what you had to do, between 
                         you and you, and I know I'm right, I 
                         don't care what you say. And now 
                         you're afraid because you found out 
                         the big part of you is a wolf that 
                         has the courage to bite off its own 
                         hand to save itself from the trap of 
                         the wrong love. That's why there has 
                         been no woman since that wrong woman. 
                         You are scared to death what the 
                         wolf will do if you make that mistake 
                         again!

                                     RONNY
                         What are you doing!

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm telling you your life!

                                     RONNY
                         Stop it!

                                     LORETTA
                         No!

                                     RONNY
                         Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a 
                         fool!

                                     LORETTA
                         Because I have no Luck!

                                     RONNY
                              (pounding on the table)
                         He made me look the wrong way and I 
                         cut off my hand. He could make you 
                         look the wrong way and you could cut 
                         off your whole head!

                                     LORETTA
                         I am looking where I should to become 
                         a bride!

                                     RONNY
                         A bride without a head!

                                     LORETTA
                         A wolf without a foot!

               Ronny stiff-arms everything off the dining table and grabs 
               Loretta. They kiss passionately. He pulls her up on the table 
               and over the table to him. They are in each other's arms. 
               They are on fire. Loretta pushes him away, gasping for air.

                                     LORETTA
                         Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

               She changes her mind and lunges into another kiss. They stop 
               again after a long moment. They really haven't breathed.

               They both suck in air and look at each other in wonder and 
               fear and passion.

                                     RONNY
                         It's like I'm falling! It's like I'm 
                         in the ocean!

               They kiss again. When they pull apart again, Loretta is 
               crying.

                                     LORETTA
                         I have no Luck!

               He picks her up in his arms.

                                     RONNY
                         Son of a bitch!

                                     LORETTA
                         Where are you taking me?

                                     RONNY
                         To the bed.

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh. Oh God. I don't care about 
                         anything. I don't care about anything! 
                         Take me to the bed.

               He carries her away, into the bedroom.

               MUSIC: "O SOAVE FANCIULLA", from "La Boheme." The MUSIC 
               CONTINUES THROUGH THE NEXT SCENE.

               INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

               Ronny is laying her down in the bed. He is over her. They 
               look into each other's eyes.

                                     RONNY
                         I can't believe what is happening.

                                     LORETTA
                         Me neither.

                                     RONNY
                         I was dead.

                                     LORETTA
                         I was dead, too.

               They kiss. When they part there is a drop of blood on 
               Loretta's lips.

                                     RONNY
                         Your blood.

                                     LORETTA
                         All my life I have never reached a 
                         man. I knew that I would reach my 
                         husband, but I took my time and he 
                         was dead. Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         I want to cut you open and crawl 
                         inside of you. I want you to swallow 
                         me.

                                     RONNY
                         I've got you.

                                     LORETTA
                         Get all of me. Take everything.

                                     RONNY
                         What about Johnny?

                                     LORETTA
                         You're mad at him, take it out on 
                         me, take your revenge on me! Take 
                         everything, leave nothing for him to 
                         marry! Hollow me out so there's 
                         nothing left but the skin over my 
                         bones. Suck me dry!

                                     RONNY
                         Alright. Alright. There will be 
                         nothing left.

               Their eyes are boiling with fierce animal tears. They have 
               opened their souls to each other and they are coming together.

               The MUSIC SWELLS to a terrible triumph.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               Dog whines over exterior.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - AN UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

               With five beds for dogs. Four of the beds are empty and on 
               the fifth Judas is whining. He looks around at the other 
               beds. Where is everybody? He goes out the bedroom door.

               THE CASTORINI STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               Judas is running down the stairs and into the hall. We FOLLOW 
               HIM down the hall. The hall is only dimly lit. He finds the 
               four other dogs. They are crowded at a narrow doorway.

               From the doorway comes a golden light.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               THE PLEASED FACE OF COSMO THROUGH A VEIL OF STEAM

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK.

               We are in the Castorini dining room. Cosmo sits at the head 
               of the table, a napkin tucked into his shirt.

               Rose has just laid down a massive platter of steaming baked 
               fish. Already on the table is a platter of pasta, loaves of 
               bread, a big bowl of salad, two bottles of wine, and an 
               appetizer plate of salami and pimento. Seated at the table 
               is COSMO, the Old Man, and RAYMOND and RITA CAPPOMAGGI.

               Raymond is rotund, moon-faced, bald, somewhere in his fifties.

               He has a pencil-thin mustache over his small mouth. His wife, 
               Rita, looks very like him, except she has hair on her head 
               and none on her lip. Raymond is Rose's brother. There are 
               two empty places at table, for Rose and Loretta.

                                     COSMO
                         Where's Loretta? We're gonna start 
                         without her.

               ONE OF THE ENTRANCE WAYS TO THE DINING ROOM

               There is an accordion gate across it. Behind the gate, the 
               Five Dogs stare at the people having dinner.

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         She must be eating out.

                                     RAYMOND'S VOICE
                         She don't know what she's missing.

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         It's not like her not to call.

                                     RITA'S VOICE
                         Well, she's got a lot on her mind.

               THE DINING TABLE - RITA IS LOADING UP HER PLATE

                                     RITA
                         I mean, can we talk about it, Rose? 
                         Everybody's heard. She's getting 
                         married again.

                                     COSMO
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great 
                         and about time. What's she gonna do 
                         with the rest of her life she don't 
                         get married?

                                     COSMO
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

               The Old Man has piled his plate high with food. Now he stands 
               up, walks over to the Dogs, and puts the plate down in their 
               midst. The Dogs attack the food and each other. The Old Man 
               walks back to the table and sits down. He looks down at the 
               empty place in front of him, a little sad.

                                     COSMO
                         My father needs a plate.

               Rose gets another plate from a sideboard and puts it in front 
               of the Old Man. He immediately, methodically begins to fill 
               his new plate. Rose goes to her place and sits down.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Cosmo. Many years ago, when they 
                         told me you were marrying my sister, 
                         I was happy. When I told Rose I was 
                         marrying Rita, she was happy.

                                     RITA
                         Marriage is happy news.

               The Old Man laughs uproariously, subsides, goes back to 
               filling his plate.

                                     COSMO
                         Rose, pass the wine.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I never seen anybody so in love like 
                         Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside 
                         the house all day and look in the 
                         windows. I never told you this cause 
                         it's not really a story. But one 
                         time I woke up in the middle of the 
                         night cause this bright light was in 
                         my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't 
                         think a what it was. I looked out 
                         the window, and it was the moon! Big 
                         as a house! I never seen the moon so 
                         big before or since. I was almost 
                         scared, like it was gonna crush the 
                         house. And I looked down, and standing 
                         there in the street was Cosmo, looking 
                         up at the windows. This is the funny 
                         part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I 
                         thought you brought this big moon 
                         over to my house cause you were so 
                         in love and woke me up with it. I 
                         was half asleep I guess and didn't 
                         know no better.

                                     COSMO
                         You were altogether asleep. You were 
                         dreaming.

                                     RAYMOND
                         No. You were there.

               Raymond stares at Cosmo, nodding, remembering. There's a 
               lull at the table, the SOUND of SILVERWARE.

                                     COSMO
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

                                     ROSE
                              (suddenly angry)
                         Well, what do you wanna talk about!

                                     COSMO
                         Rita. Pass the wine.

                                     ROSE
                         Why you drinking so much?

               The Old Man gets up with his newly filled plate and heads 
               for the Dogs.

                                     ROSE
                         Old Man, if you give another piece 
                         of my food to those dogs, I'm gonna 
                         kick you till you're dead!

               The Old Man reverses direction and heads back to his chair.

               He sits down and starts to eat.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               Over the house is a great big full moon.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The lights in the bedroom are still on. Cosmo is in bed, in 
               his pajamas, asleep. Rose comes in her nightgown. She looks 
               at Cosmo. He's snoring lightly.

                                     ROSE
                         Cosmo?

               He doesn't stir. She goes to him and runs her hand through 
               his hair.

                                     ROSE
                         You drank too much and now you sleep 
                         too hard, and later you'll be up 
                         when you should be down.

               She kisses his cheek. Then she turns out the lights. When 
               the electric lights go out, moonlight floods the room. She 
               goes to the window and looks out through the curtains at the 
               moon. Rose puts her face in her hands and quietly cries.

               The bedroom is flooded by moonlight. Loretta wakes up, a 
               little alarmed.

                                     LORETTA
                         What's that?

               Ronny wakes up, a little alarmed.

                                     RONNY
                         What?

                                     LORETTA
                         That light.

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know. I think it's the moon.

               Loretta goes to the window wrapped in a white sheet from the 
               bed. The window is glowing with moonlight. The moonlight 
               strikes her, and she is caught in its spell.

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh.

               Ronny appears behind her, pulling on a robe. They speak in 
               low voices, as if they were in church.

                                     RONNY
                         It's so bright.

                                     LORETTA
                         I've never seen a moon like that.

                                     RONNY
                         It makes you look like an angel.

               She turns and looks at him. They kiss. They break apart.

               Ronny looks up at the moon.

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah. Looks like a big snowball.

               There is a big window right by the bed, and in the window is 
               the moon. Raymond and Rita are in their bed, asleep. Raymond 
               wakes up, and sees the moon in the window. He's stunned and 
               excited, but he too speaks in this low voice of respect.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Look.

                                     RITA
                         Oh.

                                     RAYMOND
                         It's Cosmo's moon.

                                     RITA
                         What are you talking about, Raymond? 
                         Cosmo can't own the moon.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I mean it's that moon I was talking 
                         about at dinner.
                              (looks through the 
                              window, down into 
                              the street)
                         Is he down there? No.

                                     RITA
                         Is who down there?

                                     RAYMOND
                         Cosmo.

                                     RITA
                         What would he be doing down there?

                                     RAYMOND
                         I don't know.

                                     RITA
                         You know, in this light, and with 
                         that expression on your face, you 
                         look about twenty-five years old.

               Raymond smiles at her meekly.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               Over the house is still the great big full moon. The front 
               door opens and out comes the Old Man with the five Dogs.

               The Old Man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat, and he's smoking 
               a cigar. He stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume 
               of cigar smoke. Then he starts off with the Dogs down the 
               street.

               EXT.. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

               The moon and nothing else. Then a cigar is thrown into it 
               and sends it shimmering. It was the moon reflected in water.

               Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK and WE SEE the Old Man and the 
               Five Dogs are standing on a ruined pier. The moon gleams up 
               from the Hudson River. The Old Man speaks to the Dogs.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Alright now. Howl. Howl.

               The Dogs do not howl. So the Old Man, by way of demonstration, 
               howls at the moon. He looks to the Dogs to follow suit. They 
               do nothing. He howls at the moon again.

               The Dogs do nothing. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until 
               WE CAN SEE the whole pier, with the Old Man and the Dogs on 
               it, and the moon above them. The Old Man, frustrated now, 
               cries out.

                                     OLD MAN
                         How long must I wait? Quanto tempo 
                         devo aspettare!

               The Dogs start to HOWL. The Old Man, pleased as the Mad Hatter 
               he is, laughs and laughs.

               EXT. EAST RIVER - DAY

               Transition from moon reflecting in the water to dawn.

               INT. RONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

               Morning sun floods the room. Close on Loretta, she wakes up.

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh my God.

                                     RONNY
                         What?

               Loretta jumps from bed, grabs her clothes to cover herself, 
               and backs into closet.

                                     LORETTA
                         What? What have we done?

                                     RONNY
                              (perturbed)
                         Take it easy.

                                     LORETTA
                              (from closet as she 
                              hurriedly gets dressed)
                         This time I was trying to do 
                         everything right.

                                     RONNY
                              (he grabs a bathrobe, 
                              pulls it on, puts it 
                              on and moves towards 
                              the closet.)
                         Don't just become excited.

                                     LORETTA
                         I thought if I stayed away from the 
                         City Hall, I won't have that Bad 
                         Luck I had again.

                                     RONNY
                         You're trying to make me feel guilty.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm marrying your brother!

                                     RONNY
                         All right, I'm guilty. I confess!

                                     LORETTA
                         You're invited to the wedding! It's 
                         in a few weeks. Why didn't you do 
                         like him and be with your dying mother 
                         in Palermo?

                                     RONNY
                         She didn't like me.

                                     LORETTA
                         You don't get along with anybody!

                                     RONNY
                         What did you do?

                                     LORETTA
                         What did I do?

                                     RONNY
                         You ruined my life.

                                     LORETTA
                         That's impossible! It was ruint when 
                         I got here! You ruint my life!

                                     RONNY
                         Oh no I didn't!

               Loretta emerges from the closet, tucking in her blouse.

                                     LORETTA
                         Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got 
                         those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why 
                         didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! 
                         Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why 
                         didn't I just pick up a stone and 
                         kill myself years and years ago? I'm 
                         gonna marry him!

                                     RONNY
                         What?

                                     LORETTA
                         Last night never happened, you hear 
                         me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and 
                         last night never happened, and you 
                         and I are gonna take this to our 
                         coffins!

                                     RONNY
                         I can't do that!

                                     LORETTA
                         Why not?

                                     RONNY
                         I'm in love with you!

               Loretta stares at him in alarm, slaps his face, then studies 
               his face to see the effect of the slap. She is dissatisfied 
               and slaps him again.

                                     LORETTA
                         Snap out of it!

                                     RONNY
                         I can't!

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright. Then I must never see you 
                         again. The bad blood will have to 
                         stay there between you and Johnny 
                         for all time. You won't come to the 
                         wedding.

                                     RONNY
                         I'll come to the wedding.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm telling you you can't.

                                     RONNY
                         But he wants me to come!

                                     LORETTA
                         But that's cause he don't know!

                                     RONNY
                         Alright. I will not come. Provided 
                         one thing.

                                     LORETTA
                         What?

                                     RONNY
                         That you come with me tonight. Once. 
                         To the Opera.

                                     LORETTA
                         What are you talking about?

                                     RONNY
                         I love two things. I love you, and I 
                         love the Opera. If I can have the 
                         two things that I love together for 
                         one night, I will be satisfied to 
                         give up the rest of my life.

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright.

                                     RONNY
                         Alright. Meet me at the Met.

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright. Where's the Met?

               CATHOLIC CHURCH IN LITTLE ITALY - DAY

               Camera moves from stained glass windows to confessional.

               Loretta is next in line of THREE SINNERS waiting to go into 
               the confessional. A FORGIVEN WOMAN emerges from the curtained 
               booth and walks off to pay her penance. Loretta goes into 
               the booth.

               INT. CHURCH - CONFESSIONAL - DAY

               Loretta kneels. The slide opens and an OLD PRIEST'S FACE can 
               be seen in outline through the screen.

                                     LORETTA
                         Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. 
                         It's been two months since my last 
                         confession.

                                     PRIEST
                         What sins have you to confess?

                                     LORETTA
                         Twice I took the name of God in vain, 
                         once I slept with the brother of my 
                         fiancé, and once I bounced a check 
                         at the liquor store -- but that was 
                         really an accident.

                                     PRIEST
                         Then it was not a sin. But what was 
                         that second thing you said, Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         I... a... slept with my fiancé's 
                         brother.

                                     PRIEST
                         That's a pretty big sin.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know.

                                     PRIEST
                         You should think about this.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know.

                                     PRIEST
                         Alright. This is your penance. Say 
                         two rosaries and... be careful, 
                         Loretta. Reflect on your life.

                                     LORETTA
                         Alright.

                                     PRIEST
                         I absolve you in the name of the 
                         Father, and of the Son, and of the 
                         Holy Spirit, Amen.

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               Loretta comes out of the confessional and enters a pew. She 
               crosses herself. Then she recognizes the back of a woman's 
               head a few pews down. She gets up, walks down the aisle, and 
               kneels down next to her mother, Rose.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi.

                                     ROSE
                              (looking up from her 
                              prayers)
                         Where you been?

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't wanna talk about it.

                                     ROSE
                         Just like your father. I lied to 
                         him. He thinks you came home last 
                         night.

                                     LORETTA
                         Thanks. What's the matter with you?

                                     ROSE
                         Cosmo's cheating on me.

                                     LORETTA
                         What! How do you know?

                                     ROSE
                         A wife knows.

                                     LORETTA
                         Then you don't know. You're just 
                         imagining it. He's too old.

               Rose starts to reply, but then decides it's not worth the 
               argument.

                                     LORETTA
                         I won't be home for dinner.

               Loretta crosses herself quickly, gets up, and leaves. Rose 
               looks after, and then goes back to her prayer.

               INT. CAMMARERI'S BAKERY - DAY

               Feminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue 
               icing to a wedding cake. Then the hands set the plastic bride 
               and groom on the pinnacle. The CAMERA PULLS BACK.

               Barbara is viewing her handiwork, a wedding cake on a 
               stainless steel wheeled cart. She's in the back part of the 
               bakery. Barbara is pleased with her creation. We TRAVEL WITH 
               HER as she rolls the cart out to the front of the store where 
               Chrissy is waiting on a huge man named HARVEY. She hands him 
               a tiny box, which he takes meekly.

                                     HARVEY
                         See you tomorrow, Chrissy.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Okay, Harvey.

               Harvey lumbers off as Barbara enters the front of the store 
               with the cake on its cart. Barbara calls Chrissy's attention 
               to the cake.

                                     BARBARA
                         So what do you think?

                                     CHRISSY
                         About what?

                                     BARBARA
                         The cake!

                                     CHRISSY
                              (without enthusiasm)
                         Where's Ronny? How come he ain't 
                         come down?

                                     BARBARA
                         How should I know?

               The PHONE RINGS. Chrissy answers it.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Hello, Cammareri's? Hi. Uh-huh. Okay.

               She hangs up.

                                     CHRISSY
                         That was Ronny. He don't feel good. 
                         He ain't gonna be down today.

               Chrissy comes out from behind the counter. She's staring at 
               the cake.

                                     BARBARA
                         What, is he still upset?

               Without warning, Chrissy whacks the little bride and groom 
               off the cake and on to the floor.

                                     CHRISSY
                         It's that bitch!

               Barbara looks at her, shocked.

               EXT. CAPPOMAGGI'S ITALIAN PROVISIONS - DAY

               An Italian specialty store in Little Italy.

               INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY

               Provolones and salamis hang from above. To the one side is a 
               deli counter, to the other a series of tables displaying 
               cheeses by the pound, packaged cakes, etc. In the back are a 
               few tables and a kitchen with counter. Up front, behind the 
               deli counter, stands Rita Cappomaggi in a blue apron.

               Out by the tables, Raymond unpacks some jars of olives. In 
               the back, a TRUCK DRIVER can dimly be seen eating his lunch.

                                     RAYMOND
                              (to Rita)
                         I feel great I got no sleep but I 
                         feel like Orlando Furioso!

                                     RITA
                              (looks around 
                              cautiously, then 
                              speaks)
                         You were a tiger last night.

                                     RAYMOND
                         And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.

                                     RITA
                         Shut up. They'll hear you in the 
                         back.

                                     RAYMOND
                         So what? The pleasure of marriage is 
                         you sleep with the woman and then 
                         you don't worry about nothing. Hey, 
                         how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's 
                         eat pasta and roll around.

                                     RITA
                              (scandalized)
                         Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! 
                         What's got into you?

                                     RAYMOND
                         I don't know! That moon! That crazy 
                         moon Cosmo sent over!

               Loretta walks in.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Hey there
                              (sings)
                         ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...

                                     LORETTA
                              (to Rita)
                         What's the matter with him?

                                     RITA
                         You got me.

                                     RAYMOND
                         You see that moon last night?

                                     LORETTA
                              (suspicious and guilty)
                         What about the moon?

                                     RAYMOND
                         Did you see it?

                                     LORETTA
                              (she lies, nervous)
                         No.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Oh.

                                     LORETTA
                         Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the 
                         deposit to the bank but I'll do the 
                         books tomorrow. I gotta go.

                                     RAYMOND
                         You gotta date?

                                     RITA
                         What are you talking about, you fool? 
                         Her fiancé's in Palermo.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Oh. Right.

                                     LORETTA
                         I got things to do.

                                     RITA
                         Sure you do. You got all that wedding 
                         stuff.

                                     LORETTA
                         Right.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Well, that's romantic, too.
                              (SINGS)
                         ...ISN'T IT ROMANTIC...

               He is walking towards the back now. He shouts to somebody in 
               the kitchen.

                                     RAYMOND
                         HEY. Make me a bowl of minestrone.

               The women are left alone.

                                     RITA
                         What's the matter? You look crazy.

                                     LORETTA
                         I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.

               INT. A CHURCH BASEMENT

               It's been set up for a church bazaar. There are several wheels 
               of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game 
               of ring toss, etc. AS THE CAMERA inventories the contents of 
               the various stands -- a LITTLE NUN sleeps in one of them -- 
               we HEAR the Old Man's VOICE.

                                     OLD MAN'S VOICE
                         I've got a lot on my mind. Things 
                         are getting bad in my house. My 
                         daughter-in-law is mad at my son 
                         because he will not pay for the 
                         wedding.

               A TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER

               An old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it 
               with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand 
               belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old 
               Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives 
               a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer.

               Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips 
               it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy 
               goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray 
               where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the 
               Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever 
               to drive the stake into the apple. This frustrates Felix.

                                     OLD MAN
                         At dinner, my daughter-in-law 
                         threatened to kill me. Things are 
                         very bad in my house.

                                     FELIX
                         Hurry up.

                                     LUCY
                         Don't fight.

                                     OLD MAN
                         If I hit the stick too hard, the 
                         apple will split. If I am too timid, 
                         the apple will fall off the stick.

                                     FELIX
                         We're supposed to do fifty apples. 
                         We only got twelve done.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I don't know what to advise my son. 
                         I think he should pay for the wedding, 
                         but it is important that he don't 
                         look ridiculous.

                                     LUCY
                         Don't make yourself sick.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at 
                         dinner.

                                     LUCY
                         Talk to him.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I will. But I must find the right 
                         moment.

                                     LUCY
                         Did you see the moon last night?

               The Old Man's eyes light up. He looks at Lucy.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Yes!

                                     FELIX
                              (in despair)
                         Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five 
                         minutes.

               INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY

               EIGHT NEAT STACKS OF MONEY BEING RUBBERBANDED

               By a woman's hands. The last stack is topped with a filled 
               out deposit slip. The banded stacks are then stuffed into a 
               night-deposit bag. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a bit to INCLUDE a 
               ledger. A last entry is made, and the ledger is shut. The 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK more, and now WE SEE Loretta reaching for 
               her coat. She puts it on, picks up the deposit bag, and sees 
               Rita.

                                     LORETTA
                         Bye, Aunt Rita.

                                     RITA
                         Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yeah, I'll be in.

               Loretta goes out the door, with Rita looking after, 
               thoughtful.

               EXT. THE CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY

               Loretta walks-down the street and comes to the CINDERELLA 
               BEAUTY SHOP, fidgets a moment, looks around to see if 
               anybody's looking, and goes in.

               WE SEE her through the window talking to MILDRED, who handles 
               appointments. Mildred nods, points, and Loretta goes back 
               into the store.

               INT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY

               WE DISCOVER an uneasy Loretta sitting in a beauty chair with 
               BONNIE, her hairdresser about to start. Bonnie is a little 
               bored.

                                     BONNIE
                         So? You want the usual?

                                     LORETTA
                         I want you to get rid of the grey.

               TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC STARTS HERE AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE 
               FOLLOWING SCENES. This music should convey that Loretta is 
               turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful 
               coach. Bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and 
               gets very excited.

                                     BONNIE
                         I've been wanting to do this for 
                         three years! Let me show you some 
                         magazines! You've got to get a 
                         manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila! 
                         I'm gonna need help!

               SHEILA, another beautician, joins Bonnie, and they both get 
               very excited and start showing Loretta and each other 
               magazines. They argue merrily about what they should do, 
               leaving Loretta far behind. A MANICURIST joins them, with 
               her stuff and starts soaking Loretta's nails.

               A MONTAGE FOLLOWS

               They're plucking her eyebrows.

               They're cutting and dying her hair.

               They're painting her nails.

               EXT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP-DAY

               Loretta comes out. Her hair is jet black and done in a much 
               more stylish way. She looks great. She looks around as if 
               she has committed a crime, and walks off quickly

               EXT. A DOWDY DRESS SHOP - DAY

               Loretta looks in the windows, is dissatisfied, and walks on.

               EXT. A BOLD DRESS SHOP - DAY

               A stylish dress shop called INSINUATION. Loretta looks in 
               the window, is intimidated, and walks on. A moment passes.

               She reappears. Tentatively, she enters.

               INT. INSINUATION - DAY

               Loretta approaches a young woman, MER, who works there. Mer 
               is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta 
               greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey 
               what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she 
               wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.

               There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various 
               dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some 
               incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in 
               a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her 
               because they're so sexy, one bores her. We don't see the 
               dress that she ultimately does buy.

               EXT. INSINUATION - DUSK

               Loretta walks out with a big shopping bag. She walks away 
               down the street.

               WE FOLLOW Loretta away down the street. She comes to a BRIDAL 
               SHOP with a big bride dummy shown off in the window She stops 
               and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and 
               stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.

               Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy, 
               bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology, 
               and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop 
               window.

               END OF MUSIC

               THE TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC COMES TO A CLOSE.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DUSK

               Night is falling. Loretta appears and enters the house.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

               As Loretta enters she drops her bag and, as she takes off 
               her coat, calls.

                                     LORETTA
                         Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay.

               A SINGLE BARK is HEARD from the top of the stairs. She looks 
               up.

               A WOODEN ACCORDION GATE SEALS OFF THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

               Visible behind the gate are a couple of dogs.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Loretta goes through a door and into the kitchen. She opens 
               the refrigerator and a cabinet, and makes herself a scotch 
               on the rocks. She sips it and starts to HUM in an understated 
               way. She takes her drink and wanders out of the kitchen.

               LORETTA WALKS INTO THE LIVING ROOM

               She walks to each lamp in the room and turns it on. There 
               are many table and standing lamps throughout the room.

               LORETTA IS LIGHTING THE FIRE

               Which was already built in the fireplace. It catches on 
               nicely. She puts her drink down and gets a big standing 
               antique mirror on rollers from its place against the wall.

               She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she 
               picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and 
               then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair. 
               Then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums. 
               She selects one and puts it on.

               MUSIC

               Loretta waltzes around in front of the mirror, flirting with 
               herself in a very serious way. She starts to unbutton her 
               blouse.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               The moon is overhead as music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA 
               SOARS UP CLOSE to the moon, until it completely FILLS THE 
               FRAME with its magic. The moon dissolves into:

               INT. THE CASTORINI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE-UP of LORETTA'S FACE as she puts the final touches on 
               her make-up. Music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA PULLS BACK. 
               WE SEE her full figure. She has changed into her evening 
               dress and put on her heels. She's swaying to the music. The 
               evening dress is sensational. She leans forward and kisses 
               the mirror.

               WE SEE THE LIPSTICK KISS ON THE MIRROR

               In the mirror, all around the kiss, is reflected the fire.

               EXT. EAST RIVER NIGHT

               The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the 
               night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river.

               But then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge 
               white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights 
               burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along 
               the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the

               MUSIC PLAYS

               END OF MUSIC

               EXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT

               LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created 
               by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled 
               with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand 
               and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. 
               Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, 
               inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous 
               color.

               LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN

               The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.

               She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights 
               up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger 
               jets.

               Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher 
               into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her 
               eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, 
               like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.

               FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER

               Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for 
               its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing 
               quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite 
               side of the fountain, is Ronny.

               He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and 
               topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises 
               a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles 
               brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and 
               starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the 
               fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her 
               attempt at composure from, Ronny.

               Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around 
               the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her.

                                     RONNY
                         Hi.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi.

                                     RONNY
                         You look beautiful. Your hair...

                                     LORETTA
                         I thought I'd try it.
                              (qrudgingly)
                         You look good.

                                     RONNY
                         Thank you.

               He goes to kiss her. She takes a step back.

                                     LORETTA
                         I said I'd go to the opera with you. 
                         Nothing else.

               Ronny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they 
               walk off in the direction of the opera house.

               ONE OF THE CHAGALL'S FROM IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE MET

               Ronny and Loretta looking up at it.

                                     LORETTA
                         Who painted that?

                                     RONNY
                         Marc Chagall. A Russian.

                                     LORETTA
                         Kinda gaudy.

                                     RONNY
                         He was having some fun. Yeah, well 
                         he's dead.
                              (he smiles)
                         Come on, let's go in.

               Ronny and Loretta join the crowd streaming into the building.

               INT. THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta enter, giving tickets to usher.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta checking their coats. Ronny's coat is 
               already off, and he's helping Loretta off with hers. He hands 
               her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns 
               and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time.

               He's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles.

                                     RONNY
                         Thank you!

                                     LORETTA
                         For what?

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know. For your hair. For 
                         your beautiful dress. For... you 
                         know, I feel like a man again. You 
                         know I love the Opera. You know it's 
                         been a long time since I've been to 
                         the Opera.

               His eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts 
               to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself.

                                     LORETTA
                         So. Where are we sitting?

                                     RONNY
                         Come on.

               He takes her arm. They pass under the great chandelier and 
               go into the house.

               THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

               THE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES

               The first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished 
               pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are 
               in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands.

               Next is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son, 
               John. They are seated and people are looking at them.

               Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down, 
               something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing 
               good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes 
               her look like a big piece of hard candy.

               Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row 
               of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.

               They are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program.

               THE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA'S POV

               The opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into 
               the dark as the house lights go down.

               WE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND

               Ronny leans his head toward her and whispers.

                                     RONNY
                         Here we go.

               As the lights come up in the orchestra pit. The CONDUCTOR 
               takes his place. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. He bows and turns to 
               the orchestra. The OVERTURE begins and PLAYS UNDER NEXT.

               EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

               The OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then 
               FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter 
               the restaurant.

               INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

               The dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied.

               The entranceway door opens and Rose enters.

               She's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly 
               approaches her. She's very dignified.

                                     JIMMY
                         Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming?

                                     ROSE
                         It's just me. I want to eat.

                                     JIMMY
                         Okay.

                                     JIMMY
                         I got a table for you right now.

               Jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall.

                                     JIMMY
                         This alright?

                                     ROSE
                         Fine.

               He seats her.

                                     JIMMY
                         Enjoy your meal.

               Jimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the 
               wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV, 
               and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, 
               is having an argument with the man across from her.

               But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and 
               the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's 
               table.

                                     BOBO
                         Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You 
                         eating alone tonight?

                                     ROSE
                         Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a 
                         martini, no ice and two olives.

                                     BOBO
                         Very good.

               Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table 
               catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a 
               little louder.

                                     SHEILA'S VOICE
                         I'm trying to explain to you how I 
                         feel. Every time I try to explain 
                         how I feel, you explain how you feel. 
                         I don't think that's really much of 
                         a response.

                                     UNSEEN MAN'S VOICE
                         Well, its the only response I've 
                         got.

               Bobo reappears with the martini and serves it.

                                     BOBO
                         You wanna see a menu?

                                     ROSE
                         Not yet. I'll wave.

               Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at 
               the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the 
               man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument 
               goes on.

                                     SHEILA'S VOICE
                         I really do hate it though, when you 
                         take that tone with me. Like you're 
                         above it all and isn't it amusing.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         But it is, isn't it?

                                     SHEILA'S VOICE
                         Not to me! This is my life, no matter 
                         how damned comical it may seem to 
                         you. I don't need some man standing 
                         above the struggle while I roll around 
                         in the mud!

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         I think you like the mud and I don't. 
                         That's fair, isn't it? If I don't 
                         care to...

               Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the 
               man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and 
               stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.

               When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to 
               Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his 
               50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the 
               earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with 
               beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and 
               apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.

                                     PERRY
                         Sorry about that, folks. She's a 
                         very pretty mental patient.

               The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself.

                                     PERRY
                         Don't mind about me. But could you 
                         do me a favor and clear her place 
                         and take away all evidence of her, 
                         and bring me a big glass of vodka?

                                     SHY WAITER
                         Absolutely!

               The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry 
               notices Rose.

               They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now.

                                     PERRY
                         I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm not disturbed. By you.

                                     PERRY
                         My lady friend has a personality 
                         disorder.

                                     ROSE
                         She was just too young for you.

               The Shy Waiter serves Perry his drink.

                                     PERRY
                              (to the Waiter)
                         Thanks, comrade.

                                     SHY WAITER
                         It's nothing!

               The Shy Waiter goes.

                                     PERRY
                              (Rose's comment strikes 
                              home)
                         Ouch. Too young! I just got that. 
                         You know how to hurt guy. How old 
                         are you?

                                     ROSE
                         None of your business.

               He drops his posturing.

                                     PERRY
                         Sorry. That was rude.

                                     ROSE
                         Will you join me for dinner?

                                     PERRY
                         Are you sure?

               She nods.

                                     PERRY
                         Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating 
                         alone, and it's amazing how often I 
                         end up doing just that.

               ROSE AND PERRY ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR DINNER

                                     ROSE
                         What do you do?

                                     PERRY
                         I'm a professor. I teach 
                         communications at N.Y.U.

                                     ROSE
                         That woman was a student of yours?

                                     PERRY
                         Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.

                                     ROSE
                         There's old saying my mother told 
                         me. Would you like to hear it?

                                     PERRY
                         Yes.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't shit where you eat.

                                     PERRY
                              (taken aback, then 
                              recovering)
                         I'll remember that. What do you do?

                                     ROSE
                         I'm a housewife.

                                     PERRY
                         Then why are you eating alone?

                                     ROSE
                         I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you 
                         a question?

                                     PERRY
                         Go ahead.

                                     ROSE
                         Why do men chase women?

                                     PERRY
                              (considers)
                         Nerves.

                                     ROSE
                         I think it's because they fear death.

                                     PERRY
                         Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I 
                         chase women? I find women charming.

                                     PERRY
                         I teach these classes I've taught 
                         for a million years. The spontaneity 
                         went out of it for me a long time 
                         ago. I started off, I was excited 
                         about something and I wanted to share 
                         it. Now it's rote, it's the 
                         multiplication table. Except 
                         sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning 
                         along and I look up, and there's 
                         this fresh young beautiful face, and 
                         it's all new to her and I'm this 
                         great guy who's just brilliant and 
                         thinks out loud. And when that 
                         happens, when I look out among those 
                         chairs and look at a young woman's 
                         face, and see me there in her eyes, 
                         me the way I always wanted to be and 
                         maybe once was, then I ask her out 
                         on a date. It doesn't last. It can 
                         go for a few weeks or a couple of 
                         precious months, but then she catches 
                         on that I'm just a burnt out old 
                         gasbag and that she's as fresh and 
                         bright and full of promise as 
                         moonlight in a martini. And at that 
                         moment, she stands up and throws a 
                         glass of water in my face, or some 
                         action to that effect.

                                     ROSE
                         What you don't know about women is a 
                         lot.

               Loretta is looking around.

                                     LORETTA
                         They get some turnout for this stuff.

                                     RONNY
                         It's the best thing there is.

                                     LORETTA
                         I like parts of it, but I don't really 
                         get it.

               IN ANOTHER PART OF THE LOBBY DURING INTERMISSION Cosmo and 
               Mona are sitting on a bench.

                                     MONA
                         You haven't once said you like my 
                         dress.

                                     COSMO
                         I like your dress.
                              (he thinks)
                         It's very bright.

               He looks around.

                                     MONA
                         Why you looking around so much?

                                     COSMO
                         I don't know. I got a feeling.

                                     MONA
                         I'm wearing your bracelet.

               He nods, still looking around.

                                     ROSE

               Rose and Perry are walking towards camera. Rose stops short, 
               stunned and alarmed by what she sees before them.

               EXT. STREET II - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE OF LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT

               The Old Man pulls up the Dogs. Aghast by what he sees before 
               him.

               EXT. STREET III - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT

               Perry and Rose face the Old Man and the dogs.

               In a silent standoff. Perry is puzzled, but has the sense to 
               say nothing. After a long moment, the Old Man silently steers 
               his dogs past them. He walks away down the dark street, 
               silently disappearing into the gloom. Perry and Rose never 
               move, but follow his slow progress until he disappears.

                                     PERRY
                         You knew that man?

                                     ROSE
                         Yes.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

               THE STAGE - THE OPERA IS IN PROGRESS

               It's the SCENE in which MIMI is standing in the falling snow.

               She SINGS to RUDOLPH. It is a beautiful, poignant moment.

               The snow is falling, falling. Mimi is SINGING her 
               heartbreaking aria of farewell. The lighted tavern window is 
               behind them, glowing with a golden light.

               WE SEE RONNY'S FACE

               He's staring intently at the stage with shining eyes. He 
               wants to share this moment with Loretta, but he is timid she 
               will not feel as he does.

               WE SEE LORETTA'S FACE

               A single tear trails down her cheek. Otherwise, she is almost 
               succeeding in hiding that the opera is moving her. She notices 
               Ronny's hand creeping towards hers, but makes no move towards 
               it.

               THE STAGE - MIMI STILL SINGING SADLY IN THE SNOWFALL

               She and Rudolph join hands.

               RONNY AND LORETTA

               grab each other's hand fiercely.

               At last, they look at each other. She is admitting that she 
               is affected by the opera. He is grateful that she admits it.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - AUDIENCE  NIGHT

               Audience exits.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE-LOBBY - NIGHT

               The lobby overflowing with the AUDIENCE coming out.

               INT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta at the coatcheck. Loretta dabs her eyes 
               and blows her nose.

                                     LORETTA
                         That was just so... awful!

                                     RONNY
                         Awful?

                                     LORETTA
                         Beautiful. Sad. She died!

                                     RONNY
                              (giving the check to 
                              the checker)
                         Yeah.

                                     LORETTA
                         I couldn't believe it! I didn't think 
                         she was going to die. I knew she was 
                         sick...

               Ronny gets the coats and helps her on with hers.

                                     RONNY
                         She had TB.

               Ronny is putting on his coat.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know. She was coughing her brains 
                         out. And still, she had to sing all 
                         the time...

               Loretta has stopped suddenly, transfixed by the sight before 
               her.

               Loretta and Ronny are standing face-to-face with Cosmo and 
               Mona. Mona's wearing a coat like a wrapper for hard candy.

               Cosmo is wearing his coat and has his hat in his hand.

               Stunned at seeing Loretta, he unconsciously puts his hat on.

               Then he thinks about it and takes it off again. He looks at 
               Ronny. Then he looks at Mona.

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop?

               Ronny looks at Loretta. He waits to follow her lead.

                                     COSMO
                         Wait for me by the doors, Mona.

               Mona obeys after looking curiously at Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         Pop? What are you doing here?

               Cosmo approaches Ronny.

                                     COSMO
                         Excuse me.

               He takes Loretta's arm and steers her a distance away for a 
               confidential exchange.

                                     LORETTA
                         Mona?

                                     COSMO
                         What'd you do to your hair?

                                     LORETTA
                         I got it done.

                                     COSMO
                         What are you doing here?

                                     LORETTA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     COSMO
                         Who is this man? You're engaged!

                                     LORETTA
                         You're married.

                                     COSMO
                         You're my daughter. I won't have you 
                         acting like a tramp!

                                     LORETTA
                         You're my father.

                                     COSMO
                         Alright. I didn't see you here.

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't know whether I saw you or 
                         not.

               Cosmo puts on his hat again. He glares at Ronny. He looks at 
               Loretta, but he's at a total loss. At last, he stalks off. 
               Loretta looks after him, angry and disturbed.

               COSMO AND MONA GOING OUT THE DOORS FROM LORETTA'S POV

               LORETTA LOOKING AFTER THEM, STRICKEN

               Ronny appears at her side, solicitous.

                                     RONNY
                         Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a 
                         drink.

               Loretta, still looking after, slowly shakes her head.

                                     LORETTA
                         That wasn't my mother.

               EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               Rose and Perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly 
               shining. About half a block away stands the Castorini house.

               They regard it. Over the house hangs the moon, cut through 
               now with a sharp grey cloud. Rose and Perry's VOICES can be 
               heard.

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         That's my house.

                                     PERRY'S VOICE
                         You mean the whole house?

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         Yes.

                                     PERRY'S VOICE
                         My God, it's a mansion!

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         It's a house.

                                     PERRY'S VOICE
                         I live in a one-bedroom apartment. 
                         What exactly does your husband do?

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                         He's a plumber.

                                     PERRY'S VOICE
                         Well. That explains it.

               The SOUND of the WIND can be heard rising up.

               NOW WE SEE ROSE AND PERRY CLOSE UP

               The rising cold wind stirs their hair. They both shiver 
               slightly.

                                     PERRY
                         Temperature's dropping.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes.

                                     PERRY
                         I guess you can't invite me in?

                                     ROSE
                         No.

                                     PERRY
                         People home.

                                     ROSE
                         No. I think the house is empty. I 
                         can't invite you in because I'm 
                         married and because I know who I am.
                         You're shaking.

                                     PERRY
                         I'm a little cold.

                                     ROSE
                         You're a little boy and you like to 
                         be bad.

                                     PERRY
                         We could go to my apartment. You 
                         could see how the other half lives.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm too old for you.

                                     PERRY
                         I'm too old for me. That's my 
                         predicament.

                                     ROSE
                         Good night.

               She kisses him on the cheek.

                                     PERRY
                         Good night. Can I kiss you on the 
                         cheek, too?

                                     ROSE
                         Sure.

               He kisses her on the cheek.

                                     PERRY
                         I'm freezing

                                     ROSE
                         Good night.

               She walks away, towards the house. Perry, shivering, looks 
               after.

               INT. THE BOERUM CAFE - A BROOKLYN BAR - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta sit at the bar. They are just finishing a 
               couple of Old-Fashions. The barman, AL, inspects their drinks.

                                     AL
                         Another Old-Fashion?

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         No thanks.

                                     RONNY
                              (to Al)
                         I think that's it.

               Al nods and walks off. Ronny leans forward to Loretta.

                                     RONNY
                         What do you want to do now?

                                     LORETTA
                         I wanna go home.

               EXT. A COLD AND EMPTY MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

               Ronny and Loretta are walking. Their breath is coming out in 
               long plumes.

                                     LORETTA
                         It's really cold.

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah. It smells like snow.

               They walk in silence for a moment, then Loretta speaks.

                                     LORETTA
                         My mother guessed that my father was 
                         seeing somebody and I told her she 
                         was crazy. She looked like a real 
                         piece of cheap goods. But who am I 
                         to talk?

               Her eyes are full of tears.

                                     RONNY
                         What's the matter?

                                     LORETTA
                         How can you ask me that?

                                     RONNY
                         You're making me feel guilty again.

                                     LORETTA
                         You are guilty. I'm guilty.

                                     RONNY
                         Of what? Only God can point the 
                         finger, Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         I know what I know.

                                     RONNY
                         And what do you know? You tell me my 
                         life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a 
                         wolf? You run to the wolf in me, 
                         that don't make you no lamb! You're 
                         gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna 
                         sell your life short? Playing it 
                         safe is just about the most dangerous 
                         thing a woman like you could do. You 
                         waited for the right man the first 
                         time, why didn't you wait for the 
                         right man again?

                                     LORETTA
                         He didn't come!

                                     RONNY
                         I'm here!

                                     LORETTA
                         You're late!

                                     RONNY
                         We're here.

               EXT. RONNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               She looks. It's Ronny's building.

                                     LORETTA
                         This is your place.

                                     RONNY
                         That's right.

                                     LORETTA
                         This is where we're going!

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah.

                                     LORETTA
                         The deal was if I came to the Opera 
                         with you you'd leave me alone forever.

               She looks for his response. He makes none.

                                     LORETTA
                         I went with you.
                              (pause, nothing)
                         Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're 
                         gonna leave me alone.
                              (pause, nothing)
                         Right?
                              (nothing)
                         A person can see where they've messed 
                         up in their life, and they can change 
                         how they do things, and they can 
                         change their Luck. Maybe my nature 
                         does draw me to you, but I don't 
                         haveta go with that. I can take hold 
                         of myself and say yes to some things 
                         and no to something that's just gonna 
                         ruin everything! I can do that. 
                         Otherwise, what is this stupid life 
                         that God gave us for what?
                              (pause, nothing)
                         Ronny? Are you listening to me?

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm really afraid.

                                     RONNY
                         Why?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm afraid of who I am.

                                     RONNY
                         I was.

                                     LORETTA
                         And you're not now?

               He shakes his head.

                                     LORETTA
                         Why not?

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know. Everything seems like 
                         nothing now against that I want you 
                         in my bed. I don't care if I burn in 
                         hell. I don't care if you burn in 
                         hell. The Past and Future is a joke 
                         to me now. I see that they're nothing, 
                         I see they ain't here. The only thing 
                         that's here is you. And me. I want 
                         you to come upstairs. Now. I tried 
                         to take everything last night, like 
                         you told me, but I couldn't. I 
                         couldn't take everything in a hundred 
                         years. It's the way we are. We 
                         compound each other.

                                     LORETTA
                         Let me go home.

                                     RONNY
                         No.

                                     LORETTA
                         Let me go home.

                                     RONNY
                         No.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm freezing to death.

                                     RONNY
                         Come upstairs. I don't care why you 
                         come. No, that's not what I mean. 
                         Loretta, I love you. Not like they 
                         told you love is and I didn't know 
                         this either. But love don't make 
                         things nice, it ruins everything, it 
                         breaks your heart, it makes things a 
                         mess. We're not here to make things 
                         perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The 
                         stars are perfect. Not us. We are 
                         here to ruin ourselves and break our 
                         hearts and love the wrong people and 
                         die! The storybooks are bullshit. 
                         Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't 
                         try to live your life out to somebody 
                         else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't 
                         try to live on milk and cookies when 
                         what you want is meat! Red meat just 
                         like me! It's wolves run with wolves 
                         and nothing else! You're a wolf just 
                         like me! Come upstairs with me and 
                         get in my bed! Come on! Come on! 
                         Come on!

               Loretta follows Ronny into his building.

               NOW WE SEE THE STREET

               Just as the door shuts. A moment passes. Lights go on in 
               Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of 
               the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the 
               middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted 
               windows.

               NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY

               Her heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks 
               up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one 
               slender, slender thread.

               MUSIC

               It's "MIMI'S ARIA"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME.

               WE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING

               At the lighted window above. "MIMI'S ARIA" PLAYS. This tableau 
               reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in 
               the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long 
               moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy 
               shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She 
               hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks 
               away down the street.

               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - RUNWAY - NIGHT

               With a great and abrupt ROAR, a big jet is landing.

               INT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

               PASSENGERS are pouring into the terminal from the plane.

               Most of them are Italian or Italian-Americans. Suddenly, Mr. 
               Johnny appears out of the shifting crowd, up very CLOSE to 
               the CAMERA. He looks alert, determined, geared up for action.

               MR. JOHNNY AT THE LUGGAGE CAROUSEL

               He pulls his two suitcases off the carousel with one quick 
               powerful jerk.

               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

               Mr. Johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes 
               to him.

               INT. OF THE CAB

               Mr. Johnny leans forward to the DRIVER and says in a very 
               definite, determined way.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         19 Cranberry Street.

               EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The cab rushes off into the night.

               EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

               The cab pulling up to the Castorini house. The living room 
               windows are all lit up. VICKI CARR can be made out SINGING 
               "IT MUST BE HIM". Mr. Johnny gets out of the cab, gets his 
               luggage, and heads for the front door. He RINGS THE BELL.

               The door opens. It's Rose. MUSIC floods out around her.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Hello. I'm sorry to call so late...

               Rose is a little tipsy.

                                     ROSE
                         Moving in?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I came right from the airport.

                                     ROSE
                         Come on in.

               She holds the door open for him and he goes in past her 
               carrying his suitcases. She closes the door.

               INT. CASTORINI HOUSE  THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Can you wake up Loretta? I need to 
                         talk to her.

                                     ROSE
                         She's not home yet. Take off your 
                         coat and come in the living room. 
                         I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk 
                         to you.

               INT. CASTORINI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               Rose comes in with two scotches on the rocks. He takes one.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Thank you.

               She turns off the stereo, and then sits down across from 
               him.

                                     ROSE
                         So.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Where is she?

                                     ROSE
                         Out. I don't know where. I was waiting 
                         up for my husband.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         It's late.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes.

               There's a pause. Mr. Johnny is uncomfortable with it.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Maybe I should go?

                                     ROSE
                         What are you doing here? You're 
                         supposed to be in Palermo.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         That's what I came to tell Loretta. 
                         There's been a miracle.

                                     ROSE
                         A miracle. Well, that's news.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         My mother's recovered.

                                     ROSE
                         You're kidding?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         The breath had almost totally left 
                         her body. She was as white as snow. 
                         And then she completely pulled back 
                         from death and stood up and put on 
                         her clothes and began to cook for 
                         everyone in the house. The mourners. 
                         And me. And herself! She ate a meal 
                         that would choke a pig!

                                     ROSE
                         That's incredible.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Yes.

               The front door can be HEARD SLAMMING, out of view, and then 
               Dogs can be HEARD BARKING. Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the 
               entranceway. The Old Man appears there, holding the Five 
               Dogs.

                                     ROSE
                         Hello Pop.

               The Old Man looks at Rose. He is a specter. He stares, and 
               then he makes a long low accusing NOISE. Then he disappears.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Who was that?

                                     ROSE
                         That was my father-in-law, who has a 
                         wrong idea in his head. Listen, 
                         Johnny, there's a question I want to 
                         ask you. And I want you to tell me 
                         the truth if you can. Why do men 
                         chase women?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Well. There's the Bible story. God 
                         took a rib from Adam and made Eve. 
                         Maybe men chase women to get the rib 
                         back. When God took the rib, he left 
                         a hole there, place where there used 
                         to be something. and the women have 
                         that. Maybe a man isn't complete as 
                         a man without a woman.

                                     ROSE
                         But why would a man need more than 
                         one woman?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't know. Maybe because he fears 
                         death.

               Rose leaps up, very excited.

                                     ROSE
                         That's it! That's the reason!

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't know.

                                     ROSE
                         No, that's really it. Thank you for 
                         answering my question.

               The FRONT DOOR SLAMS again. Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the 
               entranceway. Cosmo appears there.

                                     COSMO
                         Hi.
                              (taking in Mr. Johnny)
                         Hi.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Hello, Mr. Castorini.

                                     ROSE
                         Where you been?

                                     COSMO
                         I don't know, Rose. I don't know 
                         where I've been, and I don't know 
                         where I'm going.
                              (to Mr. Johnny)
                         You should have your eyes opened for 
                         you, my friend.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I have my eyes open.

                                     COSMO
                         You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go 
                         on any long trips.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't know what you mean.

                                     COSMO
                         I know you don't. That's the point. 
                         I'll say no more.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         You haven't said anything.

                                     COSMO
                         And that's how much I'm saying.

                                     ROSE
                         Cosmo?

                                     COSMO
                         What?

                                     ROSE
                         I just want you to know. No matter 
                         what you do. You are going to die, 
                         just like everybody else.

                                     COSMO
                         Thank you, Rose.

                                     ROSE
                         You're welcome.

                                     COSMO
                         I'm going to bed now.

               Mr. Johnny stands up. Cosmo walks off, out of view.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I'm going.

                                     COSMO'S VOICE
                              (from top of stairs)
                         Good!

                                     ROSE
                              (to Mr. Johnny)
                         He doesn't like you. Thank you for 
                         answering my question.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         You don't know where Loretta is?

                                     ROSE
                         No idea.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Then tell her I'll come by in the 
                         morning. We need to talk.

                                     ROSE
                         Okay, I'll tell her.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAWN

               We watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house. It 
               begins in darkness, and goes through the many graduations of 
               light very quickly until it's lit by the light of bright 
               morning.

               THE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND THE OLD MAN AND THE DOGS COME OUT

               He's got them on their leashes and, over his head, he carries 
               the black umbrella. He walks off toward the park and 
               disappears.

               EXT. STREET - DAY - LORETTA IS WALKING

               Along a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. She is a wreck.

               She's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't 
               slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the 
               complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks 
               great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has 
               a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is 
               slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched 
               in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING. 
               We follow her as she SINGS and walks.

               WE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW

               She's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt. 
               She comes to it again. She kicks it again.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

               Loretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and 
               enters the house.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               Rose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and 
               sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal.

               Another range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles 
               into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down.

               There are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta.

                                     ROSE
                         What the hell happened to you?

                                     LORETTA
                         Well. I don't really know where to 
                         start.

                                     ROSE
                         Your hair's different.

                                     LORETTA
                         Everything's different.

                                     ROSE
                         Are you drunk?

                                     LORETTA
                         No. Are you drunk?

                                     ROSE
                         No. But I have a hangover.

                                     LORETTA
                         Where's pop?

                                     ROSE
                         Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up 
                         last night.

               Loretta is suddenly electrified.

                                     LORETTA
                         What? He's in Sicily!

                                     ROSE
                         No more he's not.

                                     LORETTA
                         He's with his dying mother!

                                     ROSE
                         She recovered.

                                     LORETTA
                         WHAT!! She was dying!

                                     ROSE
                         It was a miracle.

                                     LORETTA
                         A miracle? This is modern times! 
                         There ain't supposed to be miracles 
                         any more!

                                     ROSE
                         I guess it ain't modern times in 
                         Sicily. He came right from the 
                         airport. He wanted to talk to you. 
                         You got a love bite on your neck. 
                         He's coming back this morning.

               With a long low MOAN, Loretta lowers her head to the table.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta 
               just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he 
               hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown 
               leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts 
               to SING "O SOAVE FANCIULLA". He SINGS it any old way, 
               occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just 
               muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he 
               remembers, which is a lot.

               WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW

               He's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an 
               ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize 
               what he is singing. They start to SING along with him.

               They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a 
               resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other 
               appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back 
               to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.

               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

               Ronny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and 
               then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him 
               in.

               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN

               Rose walks in with Ronny behind her. There's no one in the 
               kitchen. Rose calls out.

                                     ROSE
                         It's not Johnny.

               Loretta comes out of a closet, where she was hiding. She's 
               very surprised to see Ronny.

                                     LORETTA
                         Ronny!

                                     RONNY
                         Is Johnny here?

                                     LORETTA
                         He's coming.

                                     RONNY
                         Good! We can get this out on the 
                         table.
                              (to Rose)
                         I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
                              (Shakes her hand)

                                     ROSE
                         Nice to meet you. You've got a love 
                         bite on your neck. Your mother's 
                         recovered from death.

                                     RONNY
                         Oh. Good. We're not close. I'm not 
                         really moved.

                                     LORETTA
                         You've gotta get outta here.

                                     RONNY
                         No. I'm gonna wait.

                                     LORETTA
                              (arguing with Ronny)
                         Ronny, please...

                                     ROSE
                         Would anyone like some oatmeal?

               LORETTA continues arguing.

                                     RONNY
                              (ignores Loretta)
                         Yes, I would like some oatmeal.

               Ronny and Loretta sit down and Rose serves them oatmeal.

               COSMO WALKS IN dressed for business. He regards the trio, 
               puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.

                                     ROSE
                         Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's 
                         brother.

                                     COSMO
                         His brother.

               Cosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of 
               him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he 
               puls down his spoon.

                                     COSMO
                         You're Johnny's brother?

                                     RONNY
                         Yeah.

               Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.

               The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.

               THE OLD MAN WALKS IN

               He looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him.

               He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his 
               hand opens in a gesture of supplication.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I am old. The Old are not wanted. 
                         And what they say has no weight. 
                         But, my son, I must speak. You should 
                         pay for the wedding of your only 
                         daughter. You are breaking your house 
                         through pride. There. I've said it.

                                     COSMO
                         It's okay, Pop. If she gets married, 
                         I'll pay for the whole thing.

               The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at 
               the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.

               He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.

               The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts 
               down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking 
               to Cosmo.

                                     ROSE
                         Have I been a good wife?

                                     COSMO
                         Yes.

                                     ROSE
                         I want you to stop seeing her.

               Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old 
               clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists 
               to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this. 
               Then slowly, he sits down.

                                     COSMO
                         Okay.

                                     ROSE
                         And go to confession.

                                     COSMO
                              (still not looking at 
                              her)
                         A man... under stands one day... 
                         that his life is built on nothing. 
                         And that's a bad, crazy day.

                                     ROSE
                         Your life is not built on nothing. 
                         Ti amo.

               She puts her hand across the table to him.

                                     COSMO
                         Ti amo.

               He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts 
               his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been 
               able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS.

                                     LORETTA
                         It's Johnny. I'll get it.

               Loretta's tone is fatal.

                                     RONNY
                         I'll get it.

               Rose gets up.

                                     ROSE
                         I'll get it.

               She goes to answer the door.

                                     RONNY
                              (goes for the door)
                         No, I'll tell him.

                                     LORETTA
                         No, I'll tell him.
                              (to her father)
                         What am I going to tell him?

                                     COSMO
                         Tell him the truth, Loretta they 
                         find out anyway.

               Loretta looks at her father.

                                     LORETTA
                         I love you Pop.

               It's a private moment.

               But who appears at the kitchen door is not Johnny. It's the 
               CAPPOMAGGIS.

               They have their coats on and they look very serious and 
               concerned and timid.

                                     RITA
                         Hi Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi.

                                     RAYMOND
                         Hi, Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         Hi. Why ain't you at the store?

                                     RITA
                         Is there anything you want to tell 
                         us, honey?

                                     LORETTA
                         You? No.

                                     RAYMOND
                         We just come from the bank.

                                     LORETTA
                         The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO 
                         MAKE THE DEPOSIT!

                                     RITA
                              (to Raymond)
                         She's got it.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I knew she had it.

               Loretta runs out of the kitchen and reappears with her 
               everyday bag. She takes out the night deposit bag and hands 
               it to Raymond.

                                     RITA
                         We didn't know what to think. You 
                         were so weird yesterday, and then 
                         this morning, we go to the bank and 
                         no bag.

                                     RAYMOND
                              (a sudden outburst to 
                              Loretta)
                         WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!

               Raymond covers his face to hide his emotion. Rita, meanwhile 
               is clearing the oatmeal bowls.

                                     ROSE
                         Listen. Who wants coffee?

               There is a general acknowledgment. Everybody wants coffee.

               Rose passes out white mugs and begins pouring steaming drafts 
               of coffee. Raymond and Rita are standing. The rest are 
               sitting.

                                     RITA
                         So what are we doing?

                                     ROSE
                         We're waiting for Johnny Cammareri.

               Rita nods. A silence.

                                     RONNY
                         I'm his brother.

                                     TA
                              (taking and shaking 
                              his hand)
                         Nice to meet you. I'm Rita Cappomaggi.

                                     RAYMOND
                              (taking and taking 
                              his hand)
                         I'm Raymond Cappomaggi. I'm Rose's 
                         brother.

                                     RONNY
                         Nice to meet you.

               Silence. Then the Old Man erupts.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Somebody tell a joke!

               The DOORBELL RINGS. And RINGS AGAIN. Everyone is frozen for 
               a moment, then Rita mobilizes.

                                     RITA
                         I'll get it.

               She goes. Loretta puts down her coffee and deep breathes, 
               preparing herself.

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm getting palpitations!

               She pushes away her coffee.

                                     RAYMOND
                         I thought he was in Palermo.

               RITA APPEARS WITH MR. JOHNNY IN TOW

               Rita continues into the room, leaving Mr. Johnny in the 
               doorway. He is in a dark, vested suit. He is a little 
               bewildered by the crowd of people, but succeeds in hiding 
               most of his discomfort.

                                     RITA
                         It's Johnny Cammareri.

                                     LORETTA
                         Johnny.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Loretta...

                                     RONNY
                         Johnny...

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Ronny! Our mother has recovered from 
                         death!

                                     RONNY
                         Good.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Have you come to make peace with me?

                                     RONNY
                         Well. Yeah. You may not want to.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Of course I want to.

                                     LORETTA
                         I don't know. But Johnny, how did 
                         your mother recover? She was dying.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         We should talk alone.

                                     LORETTA
                         I can't. I need my family around me 
                         now.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Well. I told my mother that we were 
                         to be married. And she got well. 
                         Right away.

                                     RONNY
                         I'm sure she did.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         It was a miracle!

                                     LORETTA
                         Johnny, I have something to tell 
                         you.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I have something to tell you. But I 
                         must talk to you alone.

                                     LORETTA
                         I have no secrets from my family.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Loretta, I can't marry you.

                                     LORETTA
                         WHAT?

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         If I marry you my mother will die.

               The Old Man laughs a loud sudden laugh, and then subsides.

                                     LORETTA
                         What the hell are you talking about? 
                         We're engaged.

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta, what are you talking about?

                                     LORETTA
                         I'm talking about a promise. You 
                         proposed to me!

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         Because my mother was dying! But now 
                         she's not.

                                     RONNY
                         You're forty-two years old, Johnny, 
                         and Mama is still running your life.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         And you are a son who doesn't love 
                         his mother!

                                     LORETTA
                         And you're a big liar! I've got your 
                         ring here!

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I must ask for that back.

               Loretta struggles and pulls off the ring.

                                     LORETTA
                         Here! Take your stupid pinky ring.
                              (she throws it at 
                              Johnny)
                         Who needs it? The engagement's off.

               Mr. Johnny retrieves the ring.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         In time, you will see that this is 
                         the best thing.

                                     LORETTA
                         In time, you will drop dead, and I 
                         will come to your funeral in a red 
                         dress.

                                     RONNY
                         Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         What!

                                     RONNY
                         Will you marry me.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         What?

                                     LORETTA
                         Where's the ring?

               Ronny looks to Mr. Johnny a little sheepishly.

                                     RONNY
                         Could I a... borrow that ring.

               Mr. Johnny, in shock, hands it over to Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         Thanks.

               He kneels down before Loretta. He presents the ring to her.

                                     RONNY
                         Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini 
                         Clark?

                                     LORETTA
                         Before all these people, yes, I will 
                         marry you, Ronny Cammareri!

               She takes the ring. Ronny and Loretta kiss.

                                     ROSE
                         Do you love him, Loretta?

                                     LORETTA
                         Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh God, that's too bad.

               Ronny and Loretta enter into a long kiss. The Old Man starts 
               to cry. Cosmo leans forward to the Old Man solicitously.

                                     COSMO
                         What's the matter, Pop?

                                     OLD MAN
                              (Lifts his head and 
                              cries out)
                         I'M CONFUSED !

               Loretta pushes Ronny away, breaking the kiss. They have both 
               neglected to breathe the whole time they were kissing.

               They are both gasping for air, especially Loretta.

                                     LORETTA
                         Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

               But then she looks at Ronny, and lunges back to him, diving 
               into another kiss like a mermaid diving into the bluest ocean.

               MUSIC

               "O SOAVE FANCIULLA" from "La Boheme," COMES UP and engulfs 
               the lovers, the family, the world.

               WE SEE the faces of the lovers swirl away into a golden and 
               diamond light, and

                                                             DISSOLVE INTO:

               EIGHT FULL CHAMPAGNE GLASSES

               Glistening in sunlight on the white tabletop. Into each is 
               dropped a lump of sugar. A bottle of recently employed bitters 
               sits nearby with its cap off (like a respectful peasant in 
               aristocratic company. And the roses in the center.

               Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK. WE SEE the table is surrounded.

               Cosmo is dropping the last of the sugar cubes in the last 
               glass of champagne. Rose is by him. Rita and Raymond are 
               side by side, as are Ronny and Loretta. The Old Man sits, 
               staring at his son, intent and approving. But where is Mr. 
               Johnny?

                                     COSMO
                         Everybody take a glass.

               Everybody takes a glass. The Old Man takes one and gets up

                                     OLD MAN
                              (to Cosmo)
                         Wait.

               The Old Man takes the glass and walks over to a corner of 
               the kitchen where Mr. Johnny, deeply disturbed and somewhat 
               catatonic, sits on a step-ladder.

                                     OLD MAN
                              (continuing; to Mr. 
                              Johnny, offering the 
                              glass)
                         Here.

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         I don't want it.

               But the Old Man, wise and merry and tough, presses the glass 
               on Mr. Johnny, who takes it.

               COSMO, THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY NOW, LIFTS HIS GLASS

                                     COSMO
                         To... the family. Right? Ti amo.

               They all lift their glasses.

               CLOSE-UP OF ROSE'S FACE

                                     ROSE
                         Ti amo.

               CLOSE-UP OF RAYMOND AND RITA

                                     RAYMOND
                         That's right.

               Rita nods.

               A CLOSE-UP OF RONNY AND LORETTA DRINKING THEIR CHAMPAGNE

               And looking into each other's eyes.

               CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN

               Who knocks back his drink lustily, and then with a glittering 
               eye looks away from the table.

               MR. JOHNNY FROM THE OLD MAN'S POV

               Mr. Johnny sits without moving, holding his glass. A long 
               moment passes. Mr. Johnny is thinking. Then he nods to 
               himself. He lifts his glass and murmurs for no one to hear

                                     MR. JOHNNY
                         To family.

               CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN LOOKING AWAY FROM MR. JOHNNY

               And he laughs his laugh. This laugh could kill him. The CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK a little. He pounds the table and knocks over the 
               roses.

               A CLOSE-UP OF THE RED ROSES ON THE WHITE TABLETOP CLOSING 
               BLACK CREDITS ROLL AGAINST THE WHITE BACKGROUND.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
Mrs.Brown

 


	MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Begin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. 
	Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
	a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN
	BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and
	right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his
	left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past
	saplings and plunges on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
	air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,
	bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. 
	Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he
	hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and
	races on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
	length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now
	there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps
	fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes
	forward, never stumbling once.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and
	stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow
	circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
	wildly swaying trees.

	There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins
	round, bellows deep from his heart:

				BROWN
		God save the Queen!!

	And fires.

	Nothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes
	on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into
	empty space.  A pause.

	Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
	him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,
	waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol
	drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. 
	And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have
	fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He
	shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He
	goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. 
	Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher
	and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1864"

						FADE IN:

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from
		Balmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned
		him, on one or two occasions, as being
		a most devoted outdoor servant to
		Prince Albert during his last days
		there...

	John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.

						 CUT TO:

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	The screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover
	that we are looking at a black night-gown.

	Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an
	elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... The depths of the Queen's sorrow
		remain impenetrable.  She has now
		restricted herself to a regime of such
		ferocious introspection that we are
		all at our wits' end...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk
	is laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his
	suits before laying it carefully on the bed.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... The Household continues, at her
		instruction, to observe the rituals
		now so familiar to her, in a vain
		attempt to render vivid that which can
		never be revived...

	Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed
	carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	The hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the
	widow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is
	set in a mask of severity.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... It will not surprise you to hear
		that she continues steadfast in her
		refusal to accept any public
		engagements, however trivial...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal
	bed.  His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.

	A somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:
	DOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician.  He is placing
	potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.

	Behind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and
	remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
	room.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... Family and staff expend all their
		efforts endeavouring to draw her out
		of this state of unfettered morbidity,
		but to no avail.  Indeed, Doctor
		Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
		her sanity, unless some remedy is
		found...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	VICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT
	DRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... We must hope, therefore, that this
		Mr Brown will appeal to the Queen's
		sentimental, though deeply-held, view
		that all Highlanders are good for the
		health.  If she can at least be
		persuaded to take the air, the
		prospect of further recovery may seem
		less remote...

	The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress. 
	VICTORIA winces slightly.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
			(terrified)
		Sorry, ma'am.

	EXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:
	"ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864."

	A DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart
	bearing the Royal coat of arms.

	John BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the
	waiting driver.  He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome
	and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... He is arriving by boat this
		afternoon, by which time it is hoped
		Her Majesty will be in a fit state to
		consider riding out...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY

	SIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is
	sitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... As to that decision, along with
		all others, we remain, as ever,
		prisoners of the Queen's grief.
			(beat)
		Ever your devoted husband, Henry.

	He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope.  He is a
	middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine
	and with a civil servant's stoop.  As he looks up, we see a
	white-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door. 
	PONSONBY hands the letter to him.

				PONSONBY (CONT'D)
		Windsor.

						 CUT TO:

	CAPTION: "OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT"

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	A series of windows are being slammed open by white
	stockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER
	HOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and
	rushing to make the luncheon hour.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Queen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two
	ladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying
	along a pace behind.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into
	the icy dining room and take their designated places at the
	luncheon table.  Everybody is dressed in mourning and
	nobody speaks.  Wind whistles through the open windows. 
	Silence.

	Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the
	Prince of Wales.  He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff
	dressed and balding.  He stands next to his young wife,
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,
	trying to keep warm.

	As BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER
	bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to
	PONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
	with the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.

				JENNER
		Congratulations, Your Royal Highness!

				BERTIE
		Thank you, Doctor.

				JENNER
		A boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent.

				BERTIE
		Yes.
			(beat)
		Albert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What
		do you think?

				PONSONBY
		A fine choice, sir.

				JENNER
		Excellent!

	EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the
	carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans
	in.

				DRIVER
		Are you riding up front?

	BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.

				BROWN
		I'll stay with the pony, thank you. 
		She's all the way from Deeside and
		she's not sure she likes you yet.

	The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
	breath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.

				VICTORIA
		How many?

	LADY ELY is slightly taken aback.

				LADY ELY
		The Royal Family and senior members of
		the household, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Just them?

				LADY ELY
		Yes, ma'am.

	VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps
	through the door.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the
	other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.

	She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else
	sits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by
	waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.

	It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA
	starts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the
	same.

	Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on
	down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns
	stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne
	House.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress
	curiously.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain
	pudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and
	whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
	finished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the
	routine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.

				JENNER
		We're expecting Brown this afternoon,
		ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Whom?

	A beat.  VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with
	her napkin and rises.  Everyone else rises too.  Suddenly,
	the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		That's a very pretty shawl you are
		wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.
			(beat)
		But you are not eating enough.  One
		must not let vanity overrule one's
		appetite.

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		Yes, ma'am.

	VICTORIA nods earnestly.  Lost to the effect her words have
	had, she marches out again.  Behind her, she leaves
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
	front of all the others.  BERTIE takes her hand and
	squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

	The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance
	and the DRIVER opens the doors.

	JOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
	the time.  His eyes narrow critically.

				BROWN
		I was due at a quarter past one.
			(beat)
		You're late.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	A few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long
	corridor with PONSONBY at his side.  Their journey takes
	them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and
	householders hurrying about their duties.  The presence of
	the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed
	portraits and busts that crop up along the way.

	BROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.

				PONSONBY
			(in low tones)
		Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House
		is not as you will remember it.  The
		Household remains in full mourning and
		no-one is permitted to raise their
		voice under any circumstances
		whatsoever.  As for the Queen's
		routine, she breakfasts at nine
		thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at
		five thirty and dinner at eight forty
		five.  No one is allowed to leave the
		building while the Queen is at home. 
		On the rare occasions when she is out,
		you may ask permission to leave, but
		only with my consent. 
		You're to be ready to walk the pony at
		any time after ten o'clock.  You'll
		clean her outdoor things and do any
		odd jobs as and when she requires.

				BROWN
		How will I know?

				PONSONBY
			(surprised to be interrupted)
		I'm sorry?

				BROWN
		How will I know what she requires?

				PONSONBY
		You'll be sent a message.

				BROWN
		Who'll bring it to me?

				PONSONBY
		Her Highness' Equerry.

				BROWN
		I need a man who knows where I am.

				PONSONBY
		I'm sure it won't be difficult to find
		you.

				BROWN
		That's not good enough.

	A beat.

				PONSONBY
		Then we'll have to see what can be
		arranged.

				BROWN
		Aye, do.

	PONSONBY stiffens.  A beat.

				PONSONBY
		There is to be no communication with
		other members of the household on
		matters concerning the court except
		through myself or one of the
		Equerries.  No plans must be altered
		unless you are given prior authority
		by myself or a senior member of the
		household.

				BROWN
		I came down at the Queen's request. 
		I'll take my orders from her.

				PONSONBY
		In matters concerning the Household, I
		act on her behalf.

	BROWN takes the measure of him.

				BROWN
		Do you?

				PONSONBY
		Yes.
			(beat)
		I do.

	BROWN glances up the corridor.

				BROWN
		So, is passing wind out of the
		question or do I need permission for
		that?

	PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They
	reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the
	interview.

				PONSONBY
		As I am sure you remember from
		Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her
		Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty
		addresses you directly.

	BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a
	moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY
	waits by the door.

				PONSONBY (O.S.)
		Mr Brown, ma'am.

	VICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her
	numerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter,
	underlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY
	ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. 
	She carries on working.

	BROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything
	are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince
	Albert glimpsed in the corridor.

	Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. 
	He steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks
	up and BROWN bows deeply.

	Silence.

	She stares at him for a long moment without apparently
	registering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright
	tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black
	and knotted with tension.

	Finally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Brown.

				BROWN
		Ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You are here safely.

				BROWN
		Aye, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You are well?

				BROWN
		I am.

				VICTORIA
		And the pony?

				BROWN
		She's well, too.

	VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is
	bringing him back.  A beat.

				VICTORIA
		Your family sent cards.  It was much
		appreciated.

				BROWN
		I'm glad of it.

	In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds
	the same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike
	others, seems unaffected.

				VICTORIA
		My husband was always very
		complimentary in speaking of you.  He
		would have approved, I am sure, of my
		calling on you in this way.
			(beat)
		I trust it does not inconvenience you
		too much.

				BROWN
		I've no family, ma'am, apart from my
		brothers and sisters.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.
			(beat)
		You have a brother in service here, do
		you not?
			(furrowing her brow)
		I forget his name.

				BROWN
		Archie.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.
			(beat)
		That will be company for you.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

	Silence.  VICTORIA starts to tire.  She takes a sip of
	water and spills a little on herself.  Flustered, she
	searches for a hanky but cannot find one.  LADY ELY hurries
	up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.  BROWN
	watches all of this with genuine concern.  When VICTORIA
	finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Honest to God, I never thought to see
		you in such a state.  You must miss
		him dreadfully.

	VICTORIA stares back in stunned silence.  PONSONBY coughs
	involuntarily.  LADY ELY freezes.  A beat.

				VICTORIA
		You do not - he ... get him out.
			(beat)
		Get him out.  Get him out!

	Suddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the
	room.  LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts
	herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Some minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk. 
	His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
	ferocity with which he slams down every object.

	His younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed.  He's in his
	early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same
	distinctive kilt and tweed.

				ARCHIE
			(telling it fast)
		So the day they arrive, she greets the
		Sultan and his family with barely a
		word and then retires to her chamber. 
		The Sultan, not used to State
		Occasions without a head of State, is
		standing in the lobby waiting for
		someone to tell him what to do.  But
		the court is under strict instructions
		not to talk in the corridors so nobody
		speaks to him, not a living soul, for
		the whole afternoon.  So now it's
		dinner and everyone's standing round
		the table -- still not a word --
		waiting for Her Majesty to arrive. 
		One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's
		getting a wee bit peckish to say the
		least.  So finally, his wee laddy
		breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
		slice in his mouth.  Well, the uproar
		when she heard.  You'd have thought
		someone had stolen the crown jewels.

	BROWN stares back, still pissed off.

				BROWN
		So?

				ARCHIE
		So, there are rules.  Things you do
		and things you don't do.

				BROWN
		I was just telling the woman how I
		feel, for God's sake.

				ARCHIE
		You don't tell Her Majesty how you
		feel.

				BROWN
		I speak as I find, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		Not down south you don't.

	BROWN slams a drawer shut.  ARCHIE lets it go and watches
	his brother.  A beat.

				ARCHIE (CONT'D)
		So what did Ponsonby do when she
		started shouting?

				BROWN
		I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

	A beat, then both men burst out laughing.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY

	The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
	hurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper
	Servant's huge table for dinner.  ARCHIE leads BROWN
	through this rush of activity.

				BROWN
		How much?

				ARCHIE
		Seventy a year.

				BROWN
		Not bad, not bad.

				ARCHIE
		How about yourself?

				BROWN
		Sixty.

				ARCHIE
			(grinning)
		That's pretty good for a ghillie.

	BROWN smiles dryly.  They pour themselves a drink from the
	table.

				BROWN
		Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who
		bleeds all day?  So what does his
		valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?

				ARCHIE
		It's better than shovelling horse
		shit.

				BROWN
		If you were looking for promotion, you
		should have picked one of the
		healthier ones.

				ARCHIE
		She's hardly a full hamper herself.

				BROWN
			(beat)
		It's only grief makes her like she is.

				ARCHIE
		Three years, John.  Is that not a bit
		long to be grieving?

				BROWN
		She loved him.

				ARCHIE
		Come on, man.  There's love and
		there's ...

				BROWN
		What?

				ARCHIE
		You know what I mean.

				BROWN
		I'm not sure I do, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		There's love and there's behaving like
		you do because there's nobody to tell
		you not to.

	Hold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the
	hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.

				BROWN
		Which one of us is she flirting with?

				ARCHIE
		The good-looking one.

				BROWN
		Aye?  Then she's obviously not got
		enough to do.

				ARCHIE
		You work the system right, you could
		ask her yourself.  Just be thankful
		you're not working for Household.  The
		Queen never lets them out of her
		sight.  But wee spats like us can slip
		through the net, easy.

	A beat.  BROWN stares straight at him.

				BROWN
		I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

	The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a
	corridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA
	suddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her
	entourage are several steps past her before they realize
	what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions
	behind.

	Now we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is
	standing in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches
	him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Some hours later.  It is now raining.

	A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage
	from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES
	frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John
	BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
	around him, laughing and giggling.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING

	Rain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite
	direction down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops
	at the same place as before.

				VICTORIA
			(as if she had not seem him
			 earlier)
		Who is that?

	Lady Ely peers through the rain.

				LADY ELY
		It's Mr Brown, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		What is he doing there?

				LADY ELY
		He appears to be ... standing by his
		horse.

				VICTORIA
		I made no request to go out riding
		today.
			(beat)
		How long has he been there?

				LADY ELY
		I don't know, ma'am.
			(nervously)
		He was observed earlier, I believe.

	At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the
		courtyard.  I have no wish to go
		riding.

				PONSONBY
		I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't
		imagine -- he was certainly given no
		instructions.

				VICTORIA
		Please make sure it does not happen
		again.

				PONSONBY
		Of course, at once.

	VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

	Half an hour later, PONSONBY stands at his desk facing
	BROWN.

				PONSONBY
		What on earth did you think you were
		doing?

	BROWN stares straight back.

				BROWN
		Awaiting my orders.

				PONSONBY
		You do not report for duty unless the
		Queen requests it.  You know that very
		well.

				BROWN
		I didn't come all this way to sit on
		my arse.

				PONSONBY
		You will await your orders like
		everyone else.  Unless you prefer a
		repeat of yesterday's little
		excitement.

				BROWN
		No.

				PONSONBY
		I beg your pardon?

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY

	The next day.  From a high window, we see PONSONBY
	scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
	JOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day
	before.

	VICTORIA watches impassively.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY

	PONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.

				PONSONBY
		I thought I made myself perfectly
		clear.  You do not leave your room
		until Her Majesty requests it.

				BROWN
			(eyes straight ahead,
			 shouting back)
		Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if
		her husband was here now, he'd have
		had her out of that house and getting
		some air in her.  What the hell's the
		point in me being here otherwise?!

	From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words.  A
	beat.  PONSONBY collects himself.

				PONSONBY
		Go inside at once.

				BROWN
		Is that the Queen's request?

				PONSONBY
		Yes, it most certainly is!

	BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back
	to the stables.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, STABLES - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling
	his horse.  Suddenly he turns.

	VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her
	entourage.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Brown.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You have been told repeatedly not to
		stand in the courtyard unless
		requested to do so.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Then why do you persist in doing it?

				BROWN
		Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. 
		If ever there was a poor soul who
		needed fresh air, it is her.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA
		The Queen will ride out if and when
		she chooses.

				BROWN
		And I intend to be there when she's
		ready.

	Silence.  The two of them stare at each other.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured
	landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the
	distance, the glittering sea.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in
	silence.

	EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY

	VICTORIA looks up.

				VICTORIA
		Prince Albert was going to build a
		bench here.  He thought it one of the
		best views in Osborne.

				BROWN
		It's a fine spot, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		He thought so, yes.

	She stares ahead.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		In everything I do and everything I
		say, I try to think, as much as
		possible, what he would do, or say, if
		he were here now.  My Private
		Secretary wishes me to return to
		public duties--

	She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.

				BROWN
		If Prince Albert were here today, he'd
		tell him a thing or two.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish
		it.
			(beat)
		The same people who refused to grant
		my husband the title of King because
		he was deemed of insufficient rank--

	She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		It is a fine spot for a bench, is it
		not?

				BROWN
		Aye, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.

	A pause.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I have some letters in the saddle bag. 
		I wish to read them.

	BROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands
	her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I cannot read them like that.

	BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again.  VICTORIA cuts in.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		You will hand them to me as I require.

	BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER
	SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS
	prepare to serve soup.

	ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
	next to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in.

	But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he
	goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
	down.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room
	stops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with
	a look.

	An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
	amazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,
	hurries up to intercede.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits
		there.

				BROWN
		Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		By whose authority?

				BROWN
		My own.

	A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness.  BERTIE'S VALET stares
	icily at him.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		The order of seating at the Upper
		Servant's table is arranged personally
		by the Queen herself.

				BROWN
		That's a tautology lad.
			(unable to stop himself
			 seriously explaining it)
		If you say the Queen arranges
		something, you've no need to say she's
		done it personally.  That's
		understood.

	But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He
	stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of
	the under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried
	exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.

	Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a
	substantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty
	assistant dresser, sitting to his right.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Are you dresser to Her Majesty?

	She blinks nervously at him.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Assistant, sir, yes.

	BROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits.

				BROWN
		What's your name?

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Mary Taylor, sir.

				BROWN
		Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		I hope to go up next year.

				BROWN
		You wouldn't happen to know what the
		Queen's reading for recreation, would
		you, Mary?

	The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Lord Tennyson, sir?

	BROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant
	bursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly
	from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The
	old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
	table.

	BROWN looks up from his soup.

				BROWN
		Am I the only one eating?

	With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	A few days later.  A morning "drawing room."  Standing
	round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY
	CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that
	whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits
	knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat
	buttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself
	opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. 
	He runs through the daily itinerary.

				PONSONBY
		Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,
		at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve
		by a picnic in the grounds to
		celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. 
		Dispatches, as usual, at two.
			(finishes, then coughs)
		The Chancellor writes to say that, by
		happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes
		for the weekend.  He asks if Your
		Majesty might grant him an audience.

				VICTORIA
		Why?

				PONSONBY
		He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty
		might wish to be informed of the
		latest developments in government.

				VICTORIA
		No.  I shall be out walking.

	A beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs
	again, nervous.

				PONSONBY
		Then perhaps Your Majesty might
		consider it opportune if the Prince of
		Wales were to meet him on your behalf?

	VICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning.

				VICTORIA
		On no account.

	PONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up
	the reins.

				BERTIE
		Mama, I really do think it's time we
		made ourselves a little more ...
		available.

	VICTORIA carries on knitting.

				BERTIE (CONT'D)
		I think we must accept our position in
		the country is not entirely unrelated
		to the continued absence of the
		Monarchy from public life.
			(silence)
		I thought perhaps we might consider a
		small gesture of some kind?

	VICTORIA looks up sharply.

				VICTORIA
		Gesture?

				BERTIE
		I thought, a dinner for our
		ambassadors perhaps?

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in firmly)
		No dinners, Bertie.
			(beat)
		Why are you dressed for outdoors?

				BERTIE
		It's so infernally cold in here.

				VICTORIA
		Cold is good--
			(calling across)
		Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!

				JENNER
		I'm sorry, ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Cold is good!

				JENNER
		Excellent, ma'am, excellent.
			(trying his hand)
		But perhaps if her Majesty were to
		consider accompanying her new-found
		physical vigor with the benefits of
		mental activity...

				VICTORIA
			(becoming very agitated)
		Why am I being lectured in this way?!

				JENNER
		Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way
		did I wish to suggest--

				VICTORIA
			(cutting across him)
		I will not tolerate anybody lecturing
		me about the responsibility of the
		monarchy....

				BERTIE
		Mother....

				VICTORIA
		... Least of all my son.  It was his
		irresponsibility that drove my husband
		to his grave.

	An appalled silence.  With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs
	the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
	in another direction.

				BERTIE
		If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,
		then perhaps she might consider
		allowing the Prince of Wales to host--

				VICTORIA
		I do believe they send so many boxes
		to taunt me. 
		Doctor Jenner writes to them to say
		that my nerves are in an extremely
		fragile state and yet they continue to
		hound me with box after box after box
		after box after box!

	Silence.  VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out
	at the view.  Having recovered her composure, she turns to
	address them all.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I wish to take the Princesses for a
		swim.

	For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard.  She
	continues.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		The turns I have been taking in the
		grounds have proved most beneficial to
		me, and Brown thinks that salt water
		will do me good.

	Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR
	JENNER exchange a worried look.

	EXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen
	VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck
	into the freezing sea.  As she does so, the doors of the
	other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise
	follow her in.  Dignity does not allow them to shout out,
	but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.

	VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little
	circle.

				VICTORIA
		Don't potter, children.  Swim.

	Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

	Half an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and
	two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and
	onto her horse.  He glances at the stiff line of
	householders and mutters curtly to himself.

				BROWN
		You could buy that lot for garden
		ornaments and still see change from
		ten guineas.

	The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has
	overheard and tries to suppress a smile. 
	As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose. 
	BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Lift your foot, woman.

	Everyone hears this.  VICTORIA obeys.  Taking the reins, he
	then walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard.  As they vanish
	from site, we hear...

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		This nation is fortunate in so much as
		it is not governed by force...

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1866"

						FADE IN:

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

	The speech continues as we follow the progress of a
	Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches
	from knee to knee.  It is entitled, "Where is Britannia?"
	and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		... but by a chain of traditions that
		have been cherished from generation to
		generation, because in them -- in our
		traditions -- are embodied all the
		laws which have enabled us to create
		the greatest empire of modern times...

	During the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and
	lands on the knees of the young, earnest STANLEY.  As he
	frowns at the picture in front of him, DISRAELI winds up.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		... but, even though we have amassed
		great capital and even though we have
		established an industry with no
		parallel in the world, yet all these
		mighty creations are as nothing
		compared to the invisible customs that
		shape our lives.  To those honorable
		gentlemen of the opposition who seek
		to destroy the essential elements of
		this country, I say let them remember:
		England cannot begin again.

	During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time. 
	He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like
	Dickens on Slimfast.  He dresses almost dandyishly but
	speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance
	and cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back
	benchers, he sits.

	As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the
	Liberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every
	respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.  They stare
	levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
	smile.

	STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap.

				STANLEY
		Have you seen this?

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY

	A few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling
	down the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory
	back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
	offer their congratulations.

				STANLEY
		Should we take it seriously?

				DISRAELI
		The cartoon or Her Majesty's
		absenteeism?

				STANLEY
		Well, both.

				DISRAELI
		The question is, do we need her?

				STANLEY
		Surely, you're not suggesting we
		dispense--

				DISRAELI
		My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with
		only a handful of friends must respect
		public opinion.

	The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was
		right.  This country is not governed
		by wisdom but by talk.
			(beat)
		Granted, it wouldn't take much to
		winkle the old girl out of mourning,
		but if public opinion is against her,
		then it doesn't do to appear too
		close.

				STANLEY
		So?

				DISRAELI
		We'll see which way the wind blows.

	DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.

	EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.  It is freezing. 
	BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing
	Burns at the sea.

				BROWN
		My heart's in the Highlands, my heart
		is not here!  My heart's in the
		Highlands a-chasing the deer!  Chasing
		the wild deer and following the roe! 
		My heart's in the Highlands wherever I
		go!

	ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns.

	EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the
	cold beach to rub themselves dry.  BROWN is very energized.

				BROWN
		One box of biscuits, one box of drop
		tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen
		chocolate sponges.  It's the same
		order every week, but does anybody
		bother to check it?  Now she has to
		travel all the way to Balmoral without
		the few luxuries she actually enjoys.

				ARCHIE
		So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.

				BROWN
		Aye, but will they?

				ARCHIE
		John, it's not your problem what she
		eats.

				BROWN
		The woman's surrounded by fools!
			(beat)
		She has to be packed and ready to
		leave by seven thirty tomorrow
		morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll
		still be dressing her at eight.

	BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his
	brother.

				ARCHIE
		She's got an army of people to get her
		up and out.

				BROWN
		But I'm the only one she trusts.

	ARCHIE stares at him.  A beat.

				ARCHIE
		She'll blow hot and cold on you, John,
		she always does.  You want to be
		careful.

				BROWN
		I'm on ninety pounds a year plus
		seventy pounds for a pile of tartan
		I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much
		as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and
		that job's only for toffs.
			(raising his hip flask
			 triumphantly at the sea)
		I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! 
		Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping
		me now.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT

	A few days later.

	The clatter of carriage and horse as the ROYAL PARTY
	thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - TWILIGHT

	A mass of torches encircle the ROYAL PARTY as kilted
	GHILLIES and STAFF swarm round the carriage, opening doors
	and clambering off boxes while a regiment of PIPERS play
	them in.

	Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the
	door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by
	PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE.  Emerging from another
	carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim
	faced at the castle.  HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER
	alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves
	and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.

				PONSONBY
		Oh God, not the pipes!

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The next day.

	High over the vast, bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch
	Muick.  VICTORIA and BROWN are riding fast towards the top. 
	Reaching the summit, VICTORIA points excitedly at the far
	horizon.

				VICTORIA
		What are those?

				BROWN
		What?

				VICTORIA
		Those, over there, there.

				BROWN
			(horse chestnut trees...)
		Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.

				VICTORIA
			(beat)
		Craobhan-geanmchno...
			(bursts out laughing)
		How can I possibly say that with a
		straight face?!

	BROWN lets it go and they ride on.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I am thinking of publishing my
		"Highland Journals."

				BROWN
		Are they worth reading?

				VICTORIA
			(beat)
		I am told so.

				BROWN
		Who by?

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are
		charming.

				BROWN
		What does he know about the Highlands?

				VICTORIA
		He has been attending at Balmoral for
		many years.

				BROWN
		That doesn't make him an expert.

				VICTORIA
		His remarks were directed at the
		quality of the writing, not its
		subject.

				BROWN
		I don't groom a horse to have it
		admired by others, I groom it because
		it needs grooming.

				VICTORIA
			(curtly)
		I do not do it for others.  But
		Ponsonby thinks they are good.

				BROWN
		Just say what you have to say, woman. 
		What other people think shouldn't
		matter to you.

				VICTORIA
			(snapping)
		Of course I shall say what I have to
		say.  I always do.

	The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on.

				BROWN
		Aye, well, if all you want is a good
		opinion then he'd be sure to oblige
		you.

				VICTORIA
			(riding alongside)
		What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was
		their literary merit, a skill not
		intimately associated with the
		knowledge of grooming.
			(beat)
		Literary appreciation does not begin
		and end with Tennyson.

	BROWN lowers his head.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
			(in a softer tone)
		I mention you in them.

	BROWN says nothing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		In particular, the occasion when
		Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage
		overturned during a storm and you
		demonstrated such loyal service in
		returning the Queen and the Princesses
		safely to Balmoral.

	Taking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds
	it out to him.  A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		For friendship.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	A few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand
	at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary.

				BROWN
			(briskly)
		She'll be away on Friday between eight
		o'clock and six in the evening to
		visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's
		to make the journey there and back in
		the day she's to have no distractions
		the night before.  She'll take a light
		supper alone in her private drawing
		room and retire early.

				PONSONBY
		She'll need to sign dispatches before
		she retires.

				BROWN
		That can wait till the weekend.

				PONSONBY
		There are important papers from --

				BROWN
		It can wait.  Anything else?

				JENNER
		Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such
		a long journey?  She has only just
		recovered from a severe head cold.

				BROWN
		If I thought she wasn't up to it, I
		wouldn't let her go, would I?

	BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving
	PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	The next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the
	grounds.  VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one
	side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.

	BERTIE is in mid-plea.

				BERTIE
		Surely it is for the gentlemen to
		decide when to stop...

				VICTORIA
		It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It
		should be discouraged.

				BERTIE
		Yes, but isn't midnight a little
		excessive?

				VICTORIA
		It is quite late enough.

				BERTIE
		But mama, the room was built expressly
		for that purpose.  It has been a
		smoking-room by tradition ever since
		father --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in angrily)
		Brown's responsibilities are onerous
		enough already.  He has far too much
		to do without having to stay up all
		night waiting for you to go to bed. 
		The smoking-room will be closed and
		the lights put out at twelve o'clock.

				BERTIE
		Mama...

				VICTORIA
		And that is my last word on the
		matter.

				BERTIE
		Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think
		it's too much that the gentlemen of
		the house should be dictated to by a
		servant.

				BROWN
		It's the Queen's decision.

				BERTIE
		I beg your pardon?
			(to VICTORIA)
		Mama...?

	Before Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his
	face.

				BROWN
		I think you should go now.
			(beat)
		You've tired your mother enough.

	BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.  He glances at
	his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if
	she has not heard.  BERTIE turns and storms away.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	JOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage
	watching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple,
	MR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying
	desperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden
	visit.  They fling open the windows, slosh water on the
	fire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions,
	dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
	up, all in the space of a few seconds.

				BROWN
		There's really no need for this.

				MRS GRANT
		I'll not have her seeing it like it
		is!
			(beat)
		I know she means well, but I wish
		she'd warn us she was coming.

				BROWN
		She thinks if she warned you, you'd go
		pouring water on the fire and stuffing
		the knitting under the sofa.

				MR GRANT
		Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being
		house-proud.

	MRS GRANT surveys the room critically.

				MRS GRANT
		All right.
			(beat)
		Show her in.

	EXT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA sits on a horse and trap.  BROWN steps out and
	helps her down.

				BROWN
		They're ready now.

				VICTORIA
		I hope they didn't go to any trouble,
		John.

				BROWN
		Ah, well...

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one
	military row, smoke still steaming off the fire.  BROWN
	stands behind her, barely able to contain himself.  But for
	VICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as
	perfectly normal.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Grant.  How good it is to see you.

				MR GRANT
			(bowing deeply)
		Your Majesty.

				VICTORIA
		Mrs Grant.  How is your knee?  Has the
		pain eased a little?

				MRS GRANT
			(bobbing in terror)
		Oh not so bad, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Good.  Oh and here are Douglas and
		John.  Haven't you grown?

				MRS GRANT
			(still bobbing away)
		Growing all the time, ma'am.

	MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a
	chair.

				MR GRANT
		Will you sit, ma'am?

	From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she
	smiles as she is led to the chair.  She points to a picture
	on the wall and her good humour is infectious.

				VICTORIA
		I know that!  That's Cairn Lochan.  We
		picnicked there once, did we not,
		John?

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS,
	DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES.  Into this
	brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the
	young STANLEY.  It is all eyes and nods here.  Everyone
	knows everyone.

				DISRAELI
		Ah, the greasy pole.

				MARY ANNE
		Don't be facetious, dear. Remember
		your position.

				DISRAELI
		It's my position I'm thinking of.

	Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of
	acolytes.

				STANLEY
		I see the Prince of Wales is here.

				DISRAELI
		I hope he got his mother's permission.

	STANLEY smiles faintly.  DISRAELI homes in on a punter and
	raises his hand, already working the room.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		Lord Salisbury!

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	The society party is hotting up.  STANLEY is deep in
	conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
			(ridiculously pleased with
			 herself)
		Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound
		foolish?  Because she looks after the
		Browns and lets the sovereigns take
		care of themselves!

	A peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up.

				DISRAELI
		And in your opinion?  Is she foolish?

	The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
		Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's
		hardly right, is it?

				DISRAELI
		What?

				SOCIETY LADY 1
		Well, the Queen and --
			(appalled whisper)
		Mr Brown.

	DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.

				DISRAELI
		La superstition met le monde entier en
		flammes.

				SOCIETY LADY 2
			(thick as shit)
		I beg your pardon?

				DISRAELI
			(changing tack)
		Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown?

				STANLEY
		He is her personal servant, I believe.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
			(knowingly)
		Follows her wherever she goes.

				DISRAELI
		He would hardly make a very good
		personal assistant if he did not.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of
	QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS
	GRANT nervously prattles on.

				MRS GRANT
		... it's not my best china.  I mean,
		it is my best china now, but the
		family set got stolen last summer.

				VICTORIA
		Oh, I'm so sorry ...

				MRS GRANT
		Of course it was no-one on the Estate. 
		More likely one of the lads from
		Braemar.  Or further even.
			(beat)
		I'll fetch the salt.

	MRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the
	spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside
	the plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries
	on.

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES.

				BERTIE
		Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.

				DISRAELI
		Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure
		to see you here.

				BERTIE
		Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in
		sugar...?

				DISRAELI
		I don't think I've had that pleasure.

	DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles
	with drink.  MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while
	BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.

				BERTIE
		No doubt you've heard the rumors.

				DISRAELI
		I take no account of gossip, Your
		Highness.

				BERTIE
		My concern is for the reputation of
		the Monarchy.

				DISRAELI
		Of course.

				BERTIE
		I fear the influence he has on her. 
		The man's word is not to be credited. 
		He is an arriviste of the very lowest
		water.
			(beat)
		She's having a bust cast of him.  In
		Nero Marquino marble.

				DISRAELI
		I see.

				BERTIE
		I would talk to her myself, but she
		won't listen to me.  She must be
		persuaded, by someone she respects, to
		abandon this ridiculous favoritism
		before a situation develops.

				DISRAELI
		A situation?

				BERTIE
		I don't imagine you frequent the
		Republican Clubs.  But the fact that
		neither you nor I are members should
		not blind us to the significance of
		their existence.
			(beat)
		The Tory Party has always been our
		party.

				DISRAELI
		I'm flattered you think so.

				BERTIE
		I tell you, if we don't stick together
		on this, you could find yourself First
		President's Opposition.
			(murdering it)
		Du Royaum Uni.

				DISRAELI
		Quite.

	A beat.

				BERTIE
		I don't think we can overstate the
		seriousness of this.

	DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party. 
	The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.

				STANLEY
		What did he want?

				DISRAELI
		To know when he'll be king.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large
	table.  Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams
	proudly at BROWN as he tells a story.

				BROWN
		... so Grant here and myself are
		riding over Lochnagar and the rain's
		pouring down in sheets and all we're
		thinking about is getting home for a
		drink, when through the gloom Grant
		spots a couple of poachers.  He gives
		me a shout and we chase them down
		towards the loch until Grant has your
		men up against the stacks and he's
		shouting and cursing at them, "Why are
		you poaching on Royal land?!"  And one
		of the little fellas looks up at him
		and says, "coz we've come up in the
		world."

	For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then
	BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS
	relax.  Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. 
	Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal
	quantities of whiskey all round.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DUSK

	Later that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of
	worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps.

	Through the light, BROWN and VICTORIA clatter into the
	courtyard on the horse and trap.  DOCTOR JENNER breaks
	through the crowd in a state of high excitement.

				JENNER
		Your Majesty!  Thank goodness you're
		safe!  I'll have a bath prepared
		immediately.  I recommend Macdonald's
		African Embrocation --

				BROWN
			(cutting in)
		Ah, pipe down, man.  The woman's fine.

				VICTORIA
		We stayed a little longer than
		expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It
		was most agreeable.

				PONSONBY
		We were expecting you to return by
		six.

				VICTORIA
		And now I am back.

	BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.

				BROWN
		We took a nip of whiskey.

				VICTORIA
		To keep out the cold.

				BROWN
		Aye.

	VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before
	walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...

				VICTORIA
		Thank you, John.

	BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up,
	he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in
	utter disbelief at what she has just said.  He turns and
	leads the horse back to the stables.

				JENNER
			(under his breath)
		She's drunk.

	PONSONBY doesn't answer.  He is watching BROWN very
	closely.

				JENNER (CONT'D)
		A distinct flushing around the cheeks. 
		She was drunk, I tell you.

				PONSONBY
		No, she wasn't.

	Silence.  JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY.

				JENNER
		Surely not ...

	PONSONBY's face is set hard.

				PONSONBY
		Don't even think about it.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

	A crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of
	the annual Ghillie's Ball.

	The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them
	beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and
	JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.

	PONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching.  Close-up
	on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly.

				JENNER
		Pandora's Box ...

	With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and
	BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence. 
	A King and his Queen.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Later that night.

	We find BROWN, slouched on the ground, dead-drunk and
	snoring loudly.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	A few days later, four JOURNALISTS are scrabbling up a
	stony path, armed with telescopes.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	A large ROYAL PARTY is making its way smoothly and quietly
	up the mountain.  BROWN is on horseback, leading VICTORIA
	on a dapple-grey.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS rattle up the hill.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS scramble up to some gorse bushes, dump
	themselves down and start setting up the telescopes.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	BROWN and VICTORIA near the summit when BROWN suddenly
	stops.  He stiffens and turns to face the wind, as if
	catching a scent.  VICTORIA frowns.

				VICTORIA
		What is it, John?
			(beat)
		John?

				BROWN
		I heard something.

	BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		I won't be long.

	He dismounts and races off.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS are peering through their telescopes.

				JOURNALIST 1
		Where did he get to?  I've lost him?

	Below them, BROWN races across the riverbank and
	undergrowth, unseen.

				JOURNALIST 2
		I don't know if there's much worth
		writing about.

				JOURNALIST 1
		Hard to tell.

	BROWN rears up above them and stops.

				BROWN
		This close enough for you?  Go on!  On
		your way!  You filthy scavengers!

	The JOURNALISTS scramble to their feet and start legging it
	down the hill, while BROWN roars furiously, hurling their
	bags after them.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		You leave her alone, do you hear?!

	The JOURNALISTS vanish below the hillside.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	That night.

	BROWN is standing at the head of the table, yelling at the
	UPPER SERVANTS, irrespective of ARCHIE or anyone.

				BROWN
		If I catch the miserable by-blow who
		told those men where she'd be, then
		I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock
		Wemyss, so I will!!

	ARCHIE glances up at BERTIE'S VALET.  He is staring down at
	the table, teeth gritted, fists clenched.  BROWN rounds on
	them all again.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		What happens to John Brown is his
		business, but the Queen's security
		will never be compromised!

				BERTIE'S VALET
		We --

				BROWN
		You'll talk when I'm finished!

	BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns
	back to the table.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		That kind of disloyalty will not be
		tolerated in this house, is that
		clear?
			(beat, yelling)
		I said, is that clear?!

	There is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and
	storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

	A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to
	his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his
	copy of Punch.

				JENNER
		"Court Circular, Balmoral."
			(beat)
		"On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a
		display of sheep-dipping by local
		farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a
		seance where he was pleased to listen
		to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr
		Robert Burns himself ..."

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same
	journal.

				JENNER (O.S.)
		"... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked
		on the slopes, accompanied by family
		and friend ..."

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door.

				JENNER (O.S.)
		Mr Brown retired early.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

	BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his
	copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled.

				BROWN
		If I find out that you had anything to
		do with this, I will have you sacked.

				PONSONBY
		I believe that decision rests with Her
		Majesty.

				BROWN
		Don't think I can't persuade her.

				PONSONBY
		I don't doubt that the Queen was
		highly amused.  She has always had a
		very healthy sense of humor.

				BROWN
		This is a slur on her good name.

				PONSONBY
		In as much as the article is about
		yourself, I think you must now accept
		that the public has a right to its
		interest in you.

				BROWN
		Nobody has any rights over me.

				PONSONBY
		We are all of us subject to forces
		beyond our control, Mr Brown, even
		you.

	BROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat.

				BROWN
		You'll regret saying that.

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

	Chaos.  The Tories are losing the vote as both sides of the
	house stand and shout at each other while the SPEAKER rises
	in his chair.

				SPEAKER (O.S.)
		Order!  Order!  ORDER!

	A buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote. 
	The COUNTERS approach the chair.

				SPEAKER (CONT'D)
		Result of the vote to the first
		reading of the Bill to Disestablish
		the Irish Church.

	A murmur of excitement from the LIBERALS.

				SPEAKER (CONT'D)
		Order!

	A beat.

				COUNTER
		Ayes to the right, three hundred and
		thirty, noes to the left, two hundred
		and sixty-five...

	By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in
	cheers from the Liberal benches.  DISRAELI and the rest of
	the front bench sit in stony silence.

	Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed
	maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting:

				DILKE
		Mr Speaker, I table a motion in
		furtherance of the Bill to
		Disestablish the Monarchy!

	A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again.

				SPEAKER
		Order!  Order!!  ORDER!!!

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	An hour later the house is empty except for a few
	straggling MPs hurrying home.  An exhausted DISRAELI stands
	in the corridor with STANLEY.

				DISRAELI
		We're going to lose.

				STANLEY
		You can't know that for sure.

				DISRAELI
		Gladstone's got his party facing the
		same way for the first time in years. 
		We need help.
			(long beat)
		Where is the old girl?

				STANLEY
		Who?

				DISRAELI
		Mrs Brown.

				STANLEY
		It's questionable whether there's any
		advantage to be had from that
		direction.  She's never been less
		popular.

				DISRAELI
		In the press, perhaps.
			(holding up Punch)
		But she's sold more copies of her
		Highland Journal in three months than
		Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time
		to wheel her out.

				STANLEY
		She's refusing to leave Balmoral.

				DISRAELI
		What's her excuse this time?

				STANLEY
		The Princess Louisa is too ill to
		move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather
		upset at the recent spate of bad
		publicity.
			(beat)
		You're smiling.

				DISRAELI
		I was trying to imagine "rather
		upset."

	The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the
	lobby doors.  DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.

				DISRAELI
		Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to
		spare the time.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		I came as quickly as I could.

				DISRAELI
		You've seen the latest cartoon in
		Punch, I take it?

				DEAN WELLSELLY
			(completely lost)
		I beg your pardon?

	DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean
	Wellselly.  The Dean clears his throat and starts to read.

				DISRAELI
			(as Wellselly reads)
		One of our madder brethren in the
		house was calling for disestablishment
		of the monarchy.

	Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Good Lord.

				STANLEY
			(playing the soft glove)
		I'm sure it won't come to that.

				DISRAELI
			(the hard glove)
		No.  But it has now become a matter
		for our consciences.
			(beat)
		I was just telling Stanley how vital
		it is that the nation should feel the
		visible influence of the Sovereign. 
		As a reminder that Parliament, indeed
		my own ministry, depends on the will
		of the Queen.

	DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely.  Over his shoulder,
	STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the
	party political maneuver into a moral imperative.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		I couldn't agree with you more, but I
		am only Dean of Windsor.  I don't
		understand what ...

	DISRAELI interrupts.

				DISRAELI
		We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is
		interesting Her Majesty in some of the
		forms of worship associated with ...
		low-church Presbyterian.

	Silence.  DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of
	unrestrained horror.  Low-church.  Presbyterian.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		What can we do?

				DISRAELI
		Oh, several things.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Some days later.

	Queen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands
	in front of her, holding a copy of The Times.

				VICTORIA
		Read it.

				PONSONBY
		Again?

				VICTORIA
		Read it!

	PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.

				PONSONBY
		"The Times wishes to join the rest of
		Her Majesty's loyal subjects in
		expressing its deep joy at the news
		that the Queen is soon to come out of
		her mourning."

	VICTORIA glowers at him.

				VICTORIA
		Who told them that?

				PONSONBY
		I have no idea.

				VICTORIA
		Why not?

				PONSONBY
		I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser
		than yourself.

	Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him.

				VICTORIA
		No-one should think themselves wiser
		than me!
			(beat)
		It is not for any of the Queen's
		subjects to presume to tell Her
		Majesty when and where She should come
		out of mourning.  It is the Queen's
		sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is
		Her overwhelming amount of work and
		responsibility, work which She feels
		will soon wear her out entirely!

				PONSONBY
		Your Majesty --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting right through him)
		Is it not enough that She is uncheered
		and unguided that she should also have
		to suffer these malicious rumors?!
			(a pause, more quietly)
		I am not a fool.
			(beat)
		I know there are those in the
		establishment too afraid to attack me
		and so they attack my dearest friends. 
		Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all
		I have left of Albert.
			(beat)
		And now they attack Brown too.

	She looks up, eyes blazing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I will not give him up to them.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, ROOM ADJOINING DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	BROWN is guarding the door to the drawing room while the
	balding BERTIE muscles up, eye ball to eye ball.

				BERTIE
		I wish to see my mother.

				BROWN
		She's busy.

				BERTIE
		Convey her a message.

				BROWN
		She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk
		to her there.

				BERTIE
		Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to
		speak with her urgently about matters
		concerning the press.

				BROWN
		Are you deaf as well as stupid?

	A split-second.  BERTIE gapes at him.

				BERTIE
		What did you say?

				BROWN
		I said, are you deaf as well as
		stupid?

				BERTIE
		Do you know who you address, sir?

				BROWN
		Whom you address.

				BERTIE
		The future King!

	A beat.

				BROWN
		Well, everyone's entitled to their
		opinion.

				BERTIE
		Out of my way!

	Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past.  Suddenly
	BROWN loses it completely.  He grabs the Prince of Wales by
	the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his
	face.

				BROWN
		LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!

	For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he
	has gone too far.  A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face,
	then ...

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

	Weeks later.

	In a roar of hooves and wheels, the Royal Carriage sweeps
	into the huge quadrangle.  JOHN BROWN stands rigid on the
	box, glowering at all the world.

	CAPTION: "WINDSOR"

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass
	of SERVANTS rush in and out, ferrying bags an trunks.

	BROWN marches in, still charged-up from the strain of the
	journey's watchfulness.  He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching
	a break.

				BROWN
		You!  What's your business here?!

				UNDER-PORTER
			(jumping to)
		Under-porter, sir.

				BROWN
		Well, don't stand where you shouldn't!

	The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs.  A few SERVANTS
	exchange looks.  BROWN seems more determined than ever to
	exert his control.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

	That night.

	Carrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks
	towards the stables.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

	The next day.

	BROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the
	grounds.  He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right,
	searching for intruders.  They are being followed at a
	distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback.  VICTORIA frowns
	peevishly.

				VICTORIA
		Must they always follow us?

				BROWN
		I ordered it.  It's for your own
		safety.

				VICTORIA
		Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch
		what I eat next.

	BROWN doesn't react.  A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Am I not safe enough with you, John?

				BROWN
		Aye.
			(looking away)
		But there are Fenians reported on the
		mainland.

				VICTORIA
			(tutting irritably)
		The threat from the Irish is greatly
		exaggerated, I'm sure.

				BROWN
			(snapping back)
		I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

	BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the
	conversation.  A beat.  He pulls up suddenly, staring at
	the shadows in the copse.

				VICTORIA
		Is anything the matter, John?
			(beat)
		John?

	He stares for along moment and then lets it go.

				BROWN
		Nothing's the matter.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

	BROWN marches down the line of horse boxes.  A stable-lad,
	BARNEY, is feeding the horses.  He looks twitchy.

				BROWN
		Hey, Barney.

				BARNEY
		Mr Brown, sir --

				BROWN
		It's cold out there tonight, Barney.

	Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.  The animal
	lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Yeah, there's a good girl.
			(to Barney)
		Have you had a look at this hoof?  She
		was limping badly.  I think there
		might be a stone in it.

				BARNEY
		Yeah, yeah, I did.

				BROWN
		Good man.  And is she all right?

				BARNEY
		Yeah.

				BROWN
		Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? 
		Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you
		know the Queen's riding tomorrow?

				BARNEY
		Yeah.

				BROWN
			(beat)
		Are you all right, Barney?

	BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.  The
	split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Oh, aye...

	The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight.

	As he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a
	fist and fling the others off him.  But the FIRST MAN is up
	again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back. 
	The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly
	strong.  Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them
	fight to force him back.  BARNEY stands transfixed in
	horror.

	Dumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start
	kicking the shit out of him.  BROWN curls into a ball, jaw
	locked, hands over his head.  Not a sound.

	Finally, they back off, panting hard.  The FIRST MAN pulls
	out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces
	whiskey down his throat.  It spills over his face and
	dribbles down his neck.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.

	VICTORIA is standing at the windows.  The door opens and
	LADY ELY walks in.

				VICTORIA
		Well?

				LADY ELY
		Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

				VICTORIA
		Why?

				LADY ELY
		I believe he is unwell, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Unwell?

				LADY ELY
		I understand he was in a fight.

				VICTORIA
		Has he been hurt?

				LADY ELY
		I believe not, ma'am.  I understand --
		he'd had rather too much to drink.

	VICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk.

				VICTORIA
		You may go.

	LADY ELY bows and walks out.  VICTORIA stares at the desk a
	moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work.  She
	cannot.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

	BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his
	undergarments.  His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid
	with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting
	his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending
	to his wounds.

				BROWN
		And she sent no word down?

				ARCHIE
		They said you were drunk.
			(beat)
		Why don't you tell her the truth?

				BROWN
		She'll think it's her fault for
		keeping me.

	ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly
	reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.

				ARCHIE
		What are you doing?!

				BROWN
		I'm getting dressed.

				ARCHIE
		You've got three broken ribs, man!

				BROWN
		I've got my duties to attend to.

				ARCHIE
		Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit
		state to go anywhere.

				BROWN
		She'll be worried about me.

				ARCHIE
		She'll get over it.

				BROWN
		I can't let her down now, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		And when was the last time she put
		herself out for you?  Look, John,
		whatever she says to you now, in the
		end you're still a servant.

				BROWN
		Oh, I'm much more than that.

				ARCHIE
		Aye, she may say that to you, but the
		woman can say what she wants.

				BROWN
		You watch your tongue.

				ARCHIE
		Come on, man, I'm telling you what you
		already know.

				BROWN
		You know nothing about her!

				ARCHIE
		When are you gonna see it, John?  She
		doesn't give a damn about you.

	BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card
	showing a coy picture of a pretty woman.  He holds it up,
	eyes blazing.

				BROWN
		From the Queen!

	He reads out the inscription.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		My lips may give a message better of
		Christmas love than e'en this letter.
			(beat)
		To my best friend, J.B. from his best
		friend, V.R.
			(he thrusts it in his
			 brother's face)
		Best friend!

				ARCHIE
		Aye.

				BROWN
		She means it.

	ARCHIE stares at him.

				ARCHIE
		She'll drop you.  When she's done with
		you, she'll drop you.

				BROWN
		Get out.
			(beat)
		Out!

	ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		OUT!!

	ARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.  VICTORIA sits at her desk.  PONSONBY hands
	her letters to sign.

				PONSONBY
		... to be followed by a visit from
		Lady Bridport.  She is keen to secure
		a place for her niece as Maid of
		Honor.

	VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.

				VICTORIA
		I am tired.

	PONSONBY coughs.

				PONSONBY
		There is one other matter.

				VICTORIA
		What is it?

				PONSONBY
		I have a letter, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		From whom?

				PONSONBY
		From Princess Helena and other members
		of your family.

				VICTORIA
			(stiffening defensively)
		My family is quite capable of
		communicating with the Queen in
		person.

	PONSONBY does not reply.  Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to
	ask.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		What do they want?

				PONSONBY
		They are demanding the dismissal of
		John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

	VICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

	VICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel, nervously
	fingering her handkerchief.  Waiting for her, smiling
	softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		You wished to see me, ma'am?

	She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

	A few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated
	in a corner of the chapel, talking softly.  She cannot
	bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how
	carefully he is watching her throughout the interview. 
	This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles
	to be as honest as possible.

				VICTORIA
		My husband tried always to make me
		think more subtly.  Of course he
		taught me so much and I can never
		repay my debt to him, or the love I
		feel, even now.  But, in truth, I
		think I am someone who can only feel
		things while they are alive to me. 
		For that reason, I know I do not have
		a subtle mind.  I know that.  But I
		work hard and I try to do my duty.
			(she hesitates; she is
			 struggling now)
		However, I have noticed of late that
		my feelings of grief are not so strong
		and -- that I find myself leaning more
		upon the comfort of living friends.
			(beat)
		Friends close to me now.

	She stops herself.  She is crying.  DEAN WELLSELLY watches
	her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words
	carefully.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Your Majesty, a settled resignation is
		more lasting proof of affection than
		active grief.  If the good Lord sees
		fit to bring one into contact with
		congenial fellow beings, one should
		not analyze one's reaction too deeply. 
		To allow oneself to be comforted by
		someone else need not imply any
		disloyalty to the memory of the loved
		one.

	Silence.  VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel. 
	Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her
	disappointment turns to anger.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day, VICTORIA stands at the far window and her
	back to the room.  Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and
	his siblings.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry.

	PONSONBY steps forward.

				PONSONBY
		Ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Please tell the Princess, and other
		signatories to this letter, that the
		Queen will not be dictated to, or made
		to alter, in any way, what she has
		found to answer for her comfort.
			(beat)
		Do I make myself clear?

				PONSONBY
		Ma'am.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA
		You may go.

	They all file out.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

	A few days later.

	BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback.  Although
	better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised. 
	They turn a corner banked by trees.  BROWN is watching the
	QUEEN closely.  She stops.

				VICTORIA
		I would like to get down.

	Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her
	horse.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		John?

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		I was told you were in a fight.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Has someone seen to those bruises?

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

	A beat.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Yes?

				BROWN
		Having considered my position here at
		court, I have come to the conclusion
		that it is in the best interest of
		Your Majesty that I should resign.

				VICTORIA
		I do not accept.

	A beat.

				BROWN
		I had foreseen that you would not. 
		But Your Majesty should understand --
		that my mind will not be changed in
		this.  I leave for Deeside --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in)
		The Queen forbids it.
			(beat)
		I cannot allow it because I cannot
		live without you.  Without you, I
		cannot find the strength to be who I
		must be.  Please.

	She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then
	looks at him, utterly helpless.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Promise me you won't let them send me
		back.

	A long silence.  BROWN holds her hand tight.

				BROWN
		I promise.

	EXT. LOWLANDS - DAY

	A few weeks later.

	A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland
	landscape.

				DISRAELI (V.O.)
		Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three
		hours on the Irish Church Bill ... I
		am as guilty as the rest of
		underestimating his reforming zeal.
		Tory days may be numbered, but I fancy
		there yet remains one last hope of
		deliverance.  Wheresoever the blame
		lies, we must now close ranks and
		defend Mrs Brown's England.  As for my
		interminable journey to the land of
		Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur ...

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	DISRAELI hurries through the pouring rain.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		... no Prime Minister made greater
		sacrifice than attempting to run the
		country six hundred miles north of
		civilization.

	Reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors
	bang behind him.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.

	QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with
	great vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish
	ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,
	almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE
	LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand
	in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. 
	Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a
	quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.

	DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards
	off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician
	to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This
	man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his
	smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she
	belts, until her children are drowned out completely.

	And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops
	playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The
	HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,
	but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.

				VICTORIA
		How dare the Irish break with the
		Anglicans? 
		If Albert were alive today he would
		never allow the Crown to give up
		Church patronage.  No, the Irish must
		be told, very firmly, to stay exactly
		where they are.  It is the thin edge
		of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.  Next, you
		will be telling me that the Crown no
		longer governs this nation.

	A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.

				DISRAELI
		Your Majesty remains at the very
		epicenter of governance.  As for your
		people, look no further than the sales
		of your Highland Journals to see in
		what affection the nation holds their
		Queen.
			(beat)
		You sell even more copies than Mr
		Dickens.

				VICTORIA
		But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.

	VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.  DISRAELI acknowledges it,
	then steers the conversation back.

				DISRAELI
		Of course I understand your concern. 
		You miss your people.
			(a pause)
		And they miss you.

	VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the
	implied criticism.

				VICTORIA
		Then they may read about me.

				DISRAELI
		Indeed, and for that they are
		eternally grateful.

				VICTORIA
		Is that not enough?

				DISRAELI
		In so many ways ... and yet it is your
		presence they crave.  A figurehead.

	VICTORIA has the measure of him.

				VICTORIA
		I never thought to be bullied by you,
		Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought,
		understood a widow's grief.

				DISRAELI
		Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for
		the nation, only for myself.  As Prime
		Minister I confess I miss your
		presence, but that is only an
		expression of my own selfish desires
		and I should not burden you with it.

	The Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA
	acknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks
	directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.

				VICTORIA
		I stay here because I am happy.
			(beat)
		Is that such a terrible crime?

				DISRAELI
		No, ma'am.

	At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.

				BROWN
		Time for your walk.

	Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts
	following him out.  As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.

				VICTORIA
		This is my good John Brown.

				DISRAELI
			(taking him in)
		Yes.

				VICTORIA
		I have asked him to show you a little
		of Highland life while you are with us
		at Balmoral.

	BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.

				BROWN
		What brings you here?

				DISRAELI
		A man can refuse only so many
		invitations from his Queen.  It was
		remiss of me not to come earlier.

	VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN stares.

				BROWN
		What do you know about the Highlands?

				DISRAELI
		I am a blank sheet.

				BROWN
		Do you hunt?

				DISRAELI
		Occasionally.

				BROWN
		Dare say you can be taught.

				DISRAELI
		To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

				BROWN
		If you hunt, you kill.

	DISRAELI counters effortlessly.

				DISRAELI
		Well then, I'll do my best.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of
	shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against
	heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud,
	crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly
	cold.

	Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. 
	The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way up
	the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and
	dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then
	the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front.

	Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up
	the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men
	on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other
	GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them
	ARCHIE.

	Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts.

	He listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his
	quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen
	dismount as quietly as they can.

	As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his
	side.  He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and
	drinks.  All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	The stalking.

	Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to
	each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill.

	DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes
	on his man, trying to make no sound.

	Suddenly, BROWN stops.  Very slowly he rises.  DISRAELI
	rides alongside and sees ...

	A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside.

	Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his
	rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.  With a
	deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines.  BROWN
	stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his
	shoulder and fires.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	The kill.

	A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ...

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his
	side.

				BROWN
			(demonstrating with his
			 rifle)
		Always remember, you keep it tight to
		your shoulder, you absorb the kick. 
		Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's
		Gladstone.

				DISRAELI
			(smiling)
		Quite.

	BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who
	declines.  He watches BROWN take a long swig.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	That night.

	BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.  He has
	a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list. 
	Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh,
	are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty
	ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIE'S VALET.  They each step up,
	one at a time, to make their report.

				BROWN
			(ticking as he goes)
		... Back doors, West Wing.

				UPPER SERVANT 1
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Side doors, East Wing.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Louder, girl!

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
			(creasing up)
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Kitchen and lower house.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Back and upper corridors.

				UPPER SERVANT 2
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Front door.
			(beat)
		Checked and locked.

	Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and
	sits.  On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid
	a clatter of cutlery and chat.

	ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched
	over his plate, pecking at his food.

	Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up.  BERTIE'S VALET
	coughs.  BROWN slowly lifts his head.  His eyes have the
	slightly unfocused look of too much drink.  It is clear to
	ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.

				BERTIE'S VALET
			(with a smug smile)
		Did you see any Irish assassins today,
		Mr Brown?

	Brown doesn't react.

				BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
		We heard the dogs were Fenian
		sympathizers.

	Brown drinks.

				BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
		Or was it the stag ...?

	Everyone bursts out laughing.  Brown slams down his glass.

				BROWN
		There's not a soul here cares about
		that wee woman's safety except me! 
		She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there
		to look out for her --

	He stops.  ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair
	and pulls gently on his arm.

	BROWN stares at the SERVANTS.  Everyone is about to burst
	out laughing.  Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his
	chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away.

	As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in
	the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	BROWN is lying on a grubby bed.  ARCHIE is looking around
	the untidy room.  For the first time, he notices a thick
	manuscript on the table.  BROWN follows his eyes.

				ARCHIE
		What's this?

				BROWN
		It's a diary.

				ARCHIE
		Be careful who sees it.

				BROWN
		What do you take me for?

	ARCHIE turns back to BROWN.

				ARCHIE
		You should have someone look after
		you.

				BROWN
		I'm all right.  I just need to rest up
		a wee bit.
			(feeling everything spin)
		The room ... You don't have to stay.

	BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift.  ARCHIE watches
	over him.

				ARCHIE
		The place is a mess.

				BROWN
		I can't move to tidy.

				ARCHIE
		It's what the maids are for.

				BROWN
		I'm not having some prattler going
		through my things.

	A beat.

				ARCHIE
		Won't you give yourself a rest, John? 
		She's other people to look out for
		her.

				BROWN
		She needs me, Archie.  She canna do
		without me, she said it to my face.
			(his hands come up to cover
			 his eyes)
		How can I stop now?

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY

	Dawn the next morning.

	BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the
	stairs.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --
	to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up
	in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket.

				BROWN
		You sent for me.

				DISRAELI
		I've been called back to London.  My
		last day.  I thought I might take a
		walk on Lochnagar.

	BROWN stares straight back.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	An hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill.  BROWN has
	his head down, on with the job.  DISRAELI slows to a halt.

				DISRAELI
		Princes and Lords are but the breath
		of kings, An honest man's the noblest
		work of God.
			(beat)
		You must miss such magnificent views.

				BROWN
		I don't think about it.

	They reach the top and continue along the high ground. 
	DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp.

				DISRAELI
		Forgive me, I've called you out and
		you should have been resting.

				BROWN
		I'm fine.

				DISRAELI
		You're injured.

				BROWN
		It's nothing.

				DISRAELI
		Still, someone must attend you.  Your
		wife should not have let you out.

				BROWN
		I'm not married.

				DISRAELI
			(deadpan)
		Oh.

				BROWN
		This is the top.

	DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.

				DISRAELI
		I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am
		not married myself, I see my wife so
		little.  But I'm forgetting the
		rewards.

	He looks across.  BROWN keeps staring ahead.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		The look on their faces when one walks
		into the room.  Still gives one a
		ridiculous thrill.

				BROWN
		I wouldn't know.

				DISRAELI
		Surely --

				BROWN
			(interrupts)
		What I do, I do for my Queen.

				DISRAELI
		Was there never ambition?

				BROWN
			(beat)
		Maybe, once.

				DISRAELI
		Then I envy yo.

				BROWN
		Why?

				DISRAELI
		To have achieved one's ambition, or to
		have reconciled oneself to its limits,
		is a lifetime's work.

				BROWN
		I do what I do.

				DISRAELI
		For Her Majesty.

				BROWN
		Aye.

				DISRAELI
		But yourself?
			(beat)
		What about John Brown?

				BROWN
		I said.
			(beat)
		I serve the Queen.

				DISRAELI
		No other aspiration?

	BROWN stares for a long moment.  Finally he speaks.

				BROWN
		To see her safe.

	DISRAELI steps a little closer.

				DISRAELI
		You will not be unaware of the threat
		now posed by Republicanism.

				BROWN
		Why do you think I keep her here?

				DISRAELI
		Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It
		is her very isolation that encourages
		the malcontents.  The longer she is
		away, the stronger they become; and
		who, honestly, can promise security
		against that?  However many doors you
		lock, someone will always get in. 
		Even here.

	BROWN watches him, eyes alert.

				BROWN
		So...?

				DISRAELI
		The truth is, the Queen would be safer
		doing her duty and returning south to
		her public.  John Bull loves her and
		John Bull is her best defense.

				BROWN
		Her mind is set.  She won't change
		now.

				DISRAELI
		She trusts you, John.

	DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.

				BROWN
		They don't see it.

				DISRAELI
		See what?

				BROWN
		The threat.
			(beat)
		I tell them, but they don't see it.

				DISRAELI
		They aren't as watchful as you.

				BROWN
		Too busy looking after themselves.

				DISRAELI
		The greasy pole.

				BROWN
		No loyalty.

				DISRAELI
		No love.

	Silence.  For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone
	else has said that.

				BROWN
		I promised to protect her from people
		like you.

				DISRAELI
		For once in my life, I am not the
		issue.

				BROWN
		She'll never understand it.

				DISRAELI
		In time, she will.

				BROWN
		She'll think I betrayed her.

				DISRAELI
		But others will know that you acted
		for the greater good.

	BROWN stares off into the distance.

	EXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY

	The next day.

	BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES
	wait on the shore.

	VICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the
	surface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them
	carefully through the water.  

				VICTORIA
		I received a letter today from Mr
		Disraeli.  Parliament is calling for
		my return to public duties.
			(beat)
		Why won't they let us be?

	BROWN does not answer.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		He insists that the country expects me
		to preside over the opening of the new
		session.  I refuse to offer sustenance
		to enable his weakening grip. 
		Besides, you know how much I should
		hate it.  It frightens me.

	She notices that BROWN has said nothing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		John?

	BROWN does not look at her.  Finally:

				BROWN
		We can't always have what we wish.

	VICTORIA stares at him.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Later that day.

	VICTORIA and BROWN are in the middle of a blazing row in
	front of the entire Household, including PONSONBY, JENNER
	and LADY ELY.

				VICTORIA
		Duty?!  You talk about duty?!

				BROWN
		If duty and safety are served by the
		same end then, aye, I do.

				VICTORIA
		I cannot believe you are saying this? 
		You, who I have relied on all this
		time --

				BROWN
			(cutting in)
		Have I ever let you down before--?

				VICTORIA
			(as if he had not spoken)
		-- You stand there and tell me it is
		my duty ... after all you promised me!

				BROWN
		I'm breaking no promises!

				VICTORIA
		You are forcing me to do the very
		thing you know I fear most!

				BROWN
		For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying
		to keep you safe!

				VICTORIA
		I will not hear any more about my
		safety!!  You made me a promise and
		now you have broken it!

	BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.

				BROWN
		-- When I took you out riding, come
		rain or shine, because I knew it was
		right for you, when I kept the bairns
		off your back so you could have a bit
		of peace, when I saw you safe from
		home to home and you didn't even know
		I was there...!  All I've ever thought
		about is you!

				VICTORIA
		Then why send me back to them?!

				BROWN
		Because I have to!
			(pause
		Will you no listen to me, woman?

	Face turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.

				VICTORIA
		Do not presume to talk to your Queen
		in that manner.

	A long silence.  BROWN watches her, but she will not look
	at him again.  Finally, she walks very slowly across the
	room.  She turns in the doorway, her voice faltering
	slightly.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell.  I shall
		retire to my chamber.  Please attend
		me presently.

	As the door slams, we ...

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "NOVEMBER"

						FADE IN:

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, DINING ROOM - DAY

	A few weeks later.

	Close on a door as it opens.  The ROYAL FAMILY are eating
	lunch with members of the UPPER HOUSEHOLD.  VICTORIA walks
	in with LADY ELY.

	A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks
	and stands.  Clearly, they were not expecting her.  In
	silence, VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head
	of the table.

	At last, PONSONBY leans forward deferentially.

				PONSONBY
		May I say, how glad I am to see Your
		Majesty so much recovered.

	VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. 
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. 
	VICTORIA frowns.

				VICTORIA
		Where is my son?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Why is he not here?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		He is sick, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Then why are you not with him?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		You ordered all members of the Royal
		Family to attend you at Balmoral.

				VICTORIA
		What is the matter with him?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

	VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.

				VICTORIA
		No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert,
		my husband, had typhoid fever.  I
		asked what was wrong with my son.

				JENNER
		The same, your Majesty.

	VICTORIA stops.  She stares down the length of the table. 
	A long pause.

				VICTORIA
		Why was I not informed?

				JENNER
		I did not consider it wise, in the
		circumstances, to tax your nerves.

				VICTORIA
		How ill is he?

	No answer.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
			(to Alexandra)
		Alex?

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		He is not well, ma'am.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I must go to him.

	Suddenly, VICTORIA stands.  Chairs bang back as everyone
	leaps to their feet.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		We must leave at once.

	Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts
	into activity.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the
	servants and Householders hurrying about in every
	direction.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage
	amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders
	rushing to be ready in time.

	Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles
	out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time 
	- yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and
	take her place.  She ignores him completely.

	BROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother
	ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a
	second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's
	obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. 
	BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races
	away under him.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	Some days later.  A tableau.

	QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch
	surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY.  They watch DOCTOR JENNER
	bend to examine the ghostly figure of BERTIE.  He listens
	for a pulse.  Finally, he looks up.

				JENNER
		Better.

	VICTORIA lets out a deep breath.  She takes hold of
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.

				VICTORIA
		Should the good Lord see fit to spare
		my son, I will order a mass to be
		celebrated at St. George's.  The
		people must share with their Queen,
		her prayers and hopes for their future
		King.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the
	door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him
	with PONSONBY at her side.

				PONSONBY
			(aside to BROWN)
		The Queen will be riding to St.
		George's on the fifth.

				BROWN
			(launching straight in)
		I recommend Her Majesty uses the
		covered carriage with a full Horse
		Guard.  In the event of any
		disturbance I will ensure --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in)
		I will ride to St. George's in an open
		carriage.  It is time the Queen was
		seen by her public.

	VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed
	by PONSONBY.  We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and
	closer until ...

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

	Some weeks later.

	A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of
	onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding
	the cathedral.  All the time, his eyes flick left and
	right, searching the faces in front of him for potential
	assassins.  Over his intense watchfulness we hear ...

				DEAN WELLSELLY (O.S.)
		... praise and magnify thy glorious
		name for that thou has raised thy
		servant Albert Edward, Prince of Wales
		from the bed of sickness. 
		We pray thee to perfect the recovery
		of thy servant and to crown him day by
		day with more abundant blessings both
		for body and soul, through Jesus
		Christ our Lord ...

	The CONGREGATION mutters a vast ...

				CONGREGATION (O.S.)
		Amen.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

	VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down
	the steps towards the cheering crowd.  As DEAN WELLSELLY
	and BROWN follow, BROWN sees ARTHUR O'CONNER break from the
	onlookers, pulling out a gun.  BROWN yells out:

				BROWN
		NO!!

	He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to
	the ground and twists the gun out of his hand.  As they
	fall we hear laughter and:

				BERTIE (O.S.)
		So there he is, Arthur O'Conner...

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, DINING HALL - NIGHT

	It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private
	dinner party.  They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY.  BROWN is in
	attendance.  He stands off to one side, near the door.

				BERTIE
			(bristling with confidence)
		... all seven stone of the man,
		paddling madly towards us through a
		sea of Horse Guards, waving something
		that looks vaguely like a pen.  I
		thought he must be one of the mother's
		ardent readership in search of the
		Royal indenture...

	More chortling.  VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly. 
	BROWN looks straight ahead.

				BERTIE (CONT'D)
		I believe I saw him first and then
		alerted Brown.  I'm not convinced that
		he wasn't taking a snooze on top of
		the box.  Anyway, we had our man
		pinned down and I must say, Brown
		acquitted himself admirably.  Of
		course the gun was a fake, but all the
		same, it was well done.

	No-one registers BROWN.  But while VICTORIA does not look
	at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.

				VICTORIA
		I intend Brown to be rewarded with a
		special medal cast in gold.  It will
		be called The Devoted Service Medal.

	The guests applaud politely.  BERTIE clinks his glass for
	attention and raises it high.

				BERTIE
		A toast.  Victoria Regina!

	The others raise their glasses in unison.

				EVERYONE
		Victoria Regina!

	VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN remains alone by the door.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		The people of England have expressed
		in a manner which cannot be mistaken,
		that they will uphold the ancient
		monarchy of England ...

	INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

	DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of
	Tory delegates.

				DISRAELI
		... If the first great object of the
		Tory Party is to maintain the
		institutions of the country, the
		second is, in my opinion, to maintain
		the Empire of England ... the

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1883"

						FADE IN:

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The sound of rain driven hard against a window.  We creep
	slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty
	year-old BROWN.  With his whiskey for company, he is
	sitting at his desk, writing in the diary.

	The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but
	there remain a few blank pages.  Slowly, he fills them in.

				BROWN (V.O.)
		We should not live in expectation of
		contentment.  Fifteen years of
		vigilance will not guarantee peace of
		mind.  Yesterday, intruders were again
		reported in the South Wing.  I believe
		my prompt arrival may have averted any
		crisis, but it was a timely reminder. 
		It is a great comfort to me that my
		efforts in securing the Queen's safety
		over the years have not been in vain. 
		Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word
		that she's dissatisfied.  And I feel
		sure that if she were unhappy she
		would have found the occasion  to
		speak to me in person, as she has so
		often done in the past.

	A knock at the door.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		What is it?

	We hear a young PAGE, breathless from running.

				PAGE
		North woods, sir.

	BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

	BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm.  He
	walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his
	hair and clothes.

	Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm.

	A coin flips through the air to be caught by an
	outstretched hand.  The second GUARD grins.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT

	BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	And now we are back with the opening sequence.  Truncated,
	severe, and shot from a slightly different angle.  The
	driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack
	to his left, he spins and plunges on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for
	air.  He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
	length.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.

	Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly
	swaying trees.  A branch snaps behind him.  He spins round,
	bellows deep from his heart:

				BROWN
		God save the Queen!!

	And fires.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A few days later.

	VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY
	ELY.  They arrive at a door.  VICTORIA stands facing it.

				VICTORIA
			(quietly)
		How long has he been this sick?

				LADY ELY
		A few days, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Why was I not told earlier?

	LADY ELY doesn't answer.  VICTORIA knows anyway.  She nods. 
	LADY ELY knocks.  The door is opened by a young UNDER
	SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here
	in the servant's quarters.  VICTORIA walks in.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of
	the life here shocks her deeply.  The cheap furniture, the
	anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.

	He is lying in bed, barely conscious.  After a moment, he
	opens his eyes and stares at her.  She steps forward,
	smiling nervously.

	Her voice is the old voice, between friends.

				VICTORIA
		You should never have gone out in such
		foul weather.

				BROWN
		Someone has to look after you.
			(pause)
		It could've been someone.  It was
		before.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.  Yes it was.

	He cannot speak.  It's difficult for her too, but she
	speaks for him.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		My Ministers are as impertinent as
		ever.  Dispatches are now so numerous,
		they come in a trunk.  Sometimes I do
		believe they will never stop.  Endless
		letters...
		 

	Her voice falters.  A pause

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I know I have not always been the
		loyal friend you deserved, John.  And
		yet here I am now, even now, feeling
		desperate at the thought of losing
		you.

	She starts to cry.

				BROWN
		Don't be silly, woman.

	His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
	herself together.  Seeing a bowl of water on the side
	table, she steps across.  Carefully folding a cloth in
	four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. 
	Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN
	gestures protectively.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Not too near.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	A week later.  PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window
	overlooking the grounds.

				JENNER
		Erysipelas.

				PONSONBY
		Not too protracted, I hope.

				JENNER
			(shakes his head)
		A few days...
			(beat)
		When he heard, the Prince of Wales
		threw the bust from the window of the
		Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to
		gather the fragments.

	A beat.

				PONSONBY
		The Queen wishes to publish an account
		of him.

				JENNER
		Dear oh dear.

				PONSONBY
		We think she can be dissuaded.
			(beat)
		Have you had a glance at the diary?

				JENNER
		Yes.

				PONSONBY
		Quite.
			(beat)
		I think I'd best take it back.

				JENNER
		Of course.

	He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it
	over to PONSONBY.  The two men move away from the window,
	to go their separate ways.  Daily business beckons.

				JENNER (CONT'D)
		Where did you find it by the way?

				PONSONBY
		Some young page was boasting about
		having seen it.
			(beat)
		Lucky.

	JENNER nods.

				JENNER
		Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.

				PONSONBY
		No, indeed.

	The two men head off in opposite directions down the
	corridor.
MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Begin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. 
	Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
	a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN
	BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and
	right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his
	left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past
	saplings and plunges on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
	air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,
	bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. 
	Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he
	hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and
	races on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
	length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now
	there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps
	fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes
	forward, never stumbling once.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and
	stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow
	circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
	wildly swaying trees.

	There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins
	round, bellows deep from his heart:

				BROWN
		God save the Queen!!

	And fires.

	Nothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes
	on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into
	empty space.  A pause.

	Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
	him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,
	waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol
	drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. 
	And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have
	fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He
	shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He
	goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. 
	Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher
	and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:

						FADE TO BLACK.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from
		Balmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned

	John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.

	The screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover
	that we are looking at a black night-gown.

	Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an
	elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... The depths of the Queen's sorrow
		remain impenetrable.  She has now
		restricted herself to a regime of such

	A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... It will not surprise you to hear

		refusal to accept any public
		engagements, however trivial...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal
	bed.  His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.

	A somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:
	DOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician.  He is placing
	potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.

	Behind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and
	remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
	room.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... Family and staff expend all their
		efforts endeavouring to draw her out
		of this state of unfettered morbidity,
		but to no avail.  Indeed, Doctor
		Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
		her sanity, unless some remedy is
		found...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	VICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT
	DRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... We must hope, therefore, that this
		Mr Brown will appeal to the Queen's
		sentimental, though deeply-held, view
		that all Highlanders are good for the
		health.  If she can at least be
		persuaded to take the air, the
		prospect of further recovery may seem
		less remote...

	The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress. 
	VICTORIA winces slightly.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
			(terrified)
		Sorry, ma'am.

	EXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:
	"ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864."

	A DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart
	bearing the Royal coat of arms.

	John BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the
	waiting driver.  He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome
	and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... He is arriving by boat this
		afternoon, by which time it is hoped
		Her Majesty will be in a fit state to
		consider riding out...

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY

	SIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is
	sitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.

				PONSONBY (V.O.)
		... As to that decision, along with
		all others, we remain, as ever,
		prisoners of the Queen's grief.
			(beat)
		Ever your devoted husband, Henry.

	He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope.  He is a
	middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine
	and with a civil servant's stoop.  As he looks up, we see a
	white-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door. 
	PONSONBY hands the letter to him.

				PONSONBY (CONT'D)
		Windsor.

						 CUT TO:

	CAPTION: "OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT"

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	A series of windows are being slammed open by white
	stockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER
	HOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and
	rushing to make the luncheon hour.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Queen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two
	ladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying
	along a pace behind.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into
	the icy dining room and take their designated places at the
	luncheon table.  Everybody is dressed in mourning and
	nobody speaks.  Wind whistles through the open windows. 
	Silence.

	Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the
	Prince of Wales.  He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff
	dressed and balding.  He stands next to his young wife,
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,
	trying to keep warm.

	As BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER
	bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to
	PONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
	with the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.

				JENNER
		Congratulations, Your Royal Highness!

				BERTIE
		Thank you, Doctor.

				JENNER
		A boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent.

				BERTIE
		Yes.
			(beat)
		Albert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What
		do you think?

				PONSONBY
		A fine choice, sir.

				JENNER
		Excellent!

	EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the
	carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans
	in.

				DRIVER
		Are you riding up front?

	BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.

				BROWN
		I'll stay with the pony, thank you. 
		She's all the way from Deeside and
		she's not sure she likes you yet.

	The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
	breath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.

				VICTORIA
		How many?

	LADY ELY is slightly taken aback.

				LADY ELY
		The Royal Family and senior members of
		the household, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Just them?

				LADY ELY
		Yes, ma'am.

	VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps
	through the door.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the
	other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.

	She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else
	sits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by
	waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.

	It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA
	starts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the
	same.

	Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on
	down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns
	stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne
	House.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress
	curiously.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

	The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain
	pudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and
	whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
	finished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the
	routine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.

				JENNER
		We're expecting Brown this afternoon,
		ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Whom?

	A beat.  VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with
	her napkin and rises.  Everyone else rises too.  Suddenly,
	the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		That's a very pretty shawl you are
		wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.
			(beat)
		But you are not eating enough.  One
		must not let vanity overrule one's
		appetite.

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		Yes, ma'am.

	VICTORIA nods earnestly.  Lost to the effect her words have
	had, she marches out again.  Behind her, she leaves
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
	front of all the others.  BERTIE takes her hand and
	squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

	The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance
	and the DRIVER opens the doors.

	JOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
	the time.  His eyes narrow critically.

				BROWN
		I was due at a quarter past one.
			(beat)
		You're late.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	A few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long
	corridor with PONSONBY at his side.  Their journey takes
	them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and
	householders hurrying about their duties.  The presence of
	the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed
	portraits and busts that crop up along the way.

	BROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.

				PONSONBY
			(in low tones)
		Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House
		is not as you will remember it.  The
		Household remains in full mourning and
		no-one is permitted to raise their
		voice under any circumstances
		whatsoever.  As for the Queen's
		routine, she breakfasts at nine
		thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at
		five thirty and dinner at eight forty
		five.  No one is allowed to leave the
		building while the Queen is at home. 
		On the rare occasions when she is out,
		you may ask permission to leave, but
		only with my consent. 
		You're to be ready to walk the pony at
		any time after ten o'clock.  You'll
		clean her outdoor things and do any
		odd jobs as and when she requires.

				BROWN
		How will I know?

				PONSONBY
			(surprised to be interrupted)
		I'm sorry?

				BROWN
		How will I know what she requires?

				PONSONBY
		You'll be sent a message.

				BROWN
		Who'll bring it to me?

				PONSONBY
		Her Highness' Equerry.

				BROWN
		I need a man who knows where I am.

				PONSONBY
		I'm sure it won't be difficult to find
		you.

				BROWN
		That's not good enough.

	A beat.

				PONSONBY
		Then we'll have to see what can be
		arranged.

				BROWN
		Aye, do.

	PONSONBY stiffens.  A beat.

				PONSONBY
		There is to be no communication with
		other members of the household on
		matters concerning the court except
		through myself or one of the
		Equerries.  No plans must be altered
		unless you are given prior authority
		by myself or a senior member of the
		household.

				BROWN
		I came down at the Queen's request. 
		I'll take my orders from her.

				PONSONBY
		In matters concerning the Household, I
		act on her behalf.

	BROWN takes the measure of him.

				BROWN
		Do you?

				PONSONBY
		Yes.
			(beat)
		I do.

	BROWN glances up the corridor.

				BROWN
		So, is passing wind out of the
		question or do I need permission for
		that?

	PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They
	reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the
	interview.

				PONSONBY
		As I am sure you remember from
		Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her
		Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty
		addresses you directly.

	BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a
	moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY
	waits by the door.

				PONSONBY (O.S.)
		Mr Brown, ma'am.

	VICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her
	numerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter,
	underlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY
	ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. 
	She carries on working.

	BROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything
	are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince
	Albert glimpsed in the corridor.

	Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. 
	He steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks
	up and BROWN bows deeply.

	Silence.

	She stares at him for a long moment without apparently
	registering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright
	tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black
	and knotted with tension.

	Finally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Brown.

				BROWN
		Ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You are here safely.

				BROWN
		Aye, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You are well?

				BROWN
		I am.

				VICTORIA
		And the pony?

				BROWN
		She's well, too.

	VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is
	bringing him back.  A beat.

				VICTORIA
		Your family sent cards.  It was much
		appreciated.

				BROWN
		I'm glad of it.

	In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds
	the same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike
	others, seems unaffected.

				VICTORIA
		My husband was always very
		complimentary in speaking of you.  He
		would have approved, I am sure, of my
		calling on you in this way.
			(beat)
		I trust it does not inconvenience you
		too much.

				BROWN
		I've no family, ma'am, apart from my
		brothers and sisters.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.
			(beat)
		You have a brother in service here, do
		you not?
			(furrowing her brow)
		I forget his name.

				BROWN
		Archie.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.
			(beat)
		That will be company for you.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

	Silence.  VICTORIA starts to tire.  She takes a sip of
	water and spills a little on herself.  Flustered, she
	searches for a hanky but cannot find one.  LADY ELY hurries
	up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.  BROWN
	watches all of this with genuine concern.  When VICTORIA
	finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Honest to God, I never thought to see
		you in such a state.  You must miss
		him dreadfully.

	VICTORIA stares back in stunned silence.  PONSONBY coughs
	involuntarily.  LADY ELY freezes.  A beat.

				VICTORIA
		You do not - he ... get him out.
			(beat)
		Get him out.  Get him out!

	Suddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the
	room.  LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts
	herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Some minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk. 
	His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
	ferocity with which he slams down every object.

	His younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed.  He's in his
	early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same
	distinctive kilt and tweed.

				ARCHIE
			(telling it fast)
		So the day they arrive, she greets the
		Sultan and his family with barely a
		word and then retires to her chamber. 
		The Sultan, not used to State
		Occasions without a head of State, is
		standing in the lobby waiting for
		someone to tell him what to do.  But
		the court is under strict instructions
		not to talk in the corridors so nobody
		speaks to him, not a living soul, for
		the whole afternoon.  So now it's
		dinner and everyone's standing round
		the table -- still not a word --
		waiting for Her Majesty to arrive. 
		One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's
		getting a wee bit peckish to say the
		least.  So finally, his wee laddy
		breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
		slice in his mouth.  Well, the uproar
		when she heard.  You'd have thought
		someone had stolen the crown jewels.

	BROWN stares back, still pissed off.

				BROWN
		So?

				ARCHIE
		So, there are rules.  Things you do
		and things you don't do.

				BROWN
		I was just telling the woman how I
		feel, for God's sake.

				ARCHIE
		You don't tell Her Majesty how you
		feel.

				BROWN
		I speak as I find, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		Not down south you don't.

	BROWN slams a drawer shut.  ARCHIE lets it go and watches
	his brother.  A beat.

				ARCHIE (CONT'D)
		So what did Ponsonby do when she
		started shouting?

				BROWN
		I think he nearly ruptured his truss.

	A beat, then both men burst out laughing.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY

	The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
	hurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper
	Servant's huge table for dinner.  ARCHIE leads BROWN
	through this rush of activity.

				BROWN
		How much?

				ARCHIE
		Seventy a year.

				BROWN
		Not bad, not bad.

				ARCHIE
		How about yourself?

				BROWN
		Sixty.

				ARCHIE
			(grinning)
		That's pretty good for a ghillie.

	BROWN smiles dryly.  They pour themselves a drink from the
	table.

				BROWN
		Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who
		bleeds all day?  So what does his
		valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?

				ARCHIE
		It's better than shovelling horse
		shit.

				BROWN
		If you were looking for promotion, you
		should have picked one of the
		healthier ones.

				ARCHIE
		She's hardly a full hamper herself.

				BROWN
			(beat)
		It's only grief makes her like she is.

				ARCHIE
		Three years, John.  Is that not a bit
		long to be grieving?

				BROWN
		She loved him.

				ARCHIE
		Come on, man.  There's love and
		there's ...

				BROWN
		What?

				ARCHIE
		You know what I mean.

				BROWN
		I'm not sure I do, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		There's love and there's behaving like
		you do because there's nobody to tell
		you not to.

	Hold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the
	hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.

				BROWN
		Which one of us is she flirting with?

				ARCHIE
		The good-looking one.

				BROWN
		Aye?  Then she's obviously not got
		enough to do.

				ARCHIE
		You work the system right, you could
		ask her yourself.  Just be thankful
		you're not working for Household.  The
		Queen never lets them out of her
		sight.  But wee spats like us can slip
		through the net, easy.

	A beat.  BROWN stares straight at him.

				BROWN
		I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

	The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a
	corridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA
	suddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her
	entourage are several steps past her before they realize
	what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions
	behind.

	Now we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is
	standing in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches
	him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Some hours later.  It is now raining.

	A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage
	from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES
	frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John
	BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
	around him, laughing and giggling.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING

	Rain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite
	direction down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops
	at the same place as before.

				VICTORIA
			(as if she had not seem him
			 earlier)
		Who is that?

	Lady Ely peers through the rain.

				LADY ELY
		It's Mr Brown, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		What is he doing there?

				LADY ELY
		He appears to be ... standing by his
		horse.

				VICTORIA
		I made no request to go out riding
		today.
			(beat)
		How long has he been there?

				LADY ELY
		I don't know, ma'am.
			(nervously)
		He was observed earlier, I believe.

	At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the
		courtyard.  I have no wish to go
		riding.

				PONSONBY
		I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't
		imagine -- he was certainly given no
		instructions.

				VICTORIA
		Please make sure it does not happen
		again.

				PONSONBY
		Of course, at once.

	VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

	Half an hour later, PONSONBY stands at his desk facing
	BROWN.

				PONSONBY
		What on earth did you think you were
		doing?

	BROWN stares straight back.

				BROWN
		Awaiting my orders.

				PONSONBY
		You do not report for duty unless the
		Queen requests it.  You know that very
		well.

				BROWN
		I didn't come all this way to sit on
		my arse.

				PONSONBY
		You will await your orders like
		everyone else.  Unless you prefer a
		repeat of yesterday's little
		excitement.

				BROWN
		No.

				PONSONBY
		I beg your pardon?

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY

	The next day.  From a high window, we see PONSONBY
	scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
	JOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day
	before.

	VICTORIA watches impassively.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY

	PONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.

				PONSONBY
		I thought I made myself perfectly
		clear.  You do not leave your room
		until Her Majesty requests it.

				BROWN
			(eyes straight ahead,
			 shouting back)
		Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if
		her husband was here now, he'd have
		had her out of that house and getting
		some air in her.  What the hell's the
		point in me being here otherwise?!

	From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words.  A
	beat.  PONSONBY collects himself.

				PONSONBY
		Go inside at once.

				BROWN
		Is that the Queen's request?

				PONSONBY
		Yes, it most certainly is!

	BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back
	to the stables.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, STABLES - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling
	his horse.  Suddenly he turns.

	VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her
	entourage.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Brown.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		You have been told repeatedly not to
		stand in the courtyard unless
		requested to do so.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Then why do you persist in doing it?

				BROWN
		Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. 
		If ever there was a poor soul who
		needed fresh air, it is her.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA
		The Queen will ride out if and when
		she chooses.

				BROWN
		And I intend to be there when she's
		ready.

	Silence.  The two of them stare at each other.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured
	landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the
	distance, the glittering sea.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

	VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in
	silence.

	EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY

	VICTORIA looks up.

				VICTORIA
		Prince Albert was going to build a
		bench here.  He thought it one of the
		best views in Osborne.

				BROWN
		It's a fine spot, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		He thought so, yes.

	She stares ahead.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		In everything I do and everything I
		say, I try to think, as much as
		possible, what he would do, or say, if
		he were here now.  My Private
		Secretary wishes me to return to
		public duties--

	She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.

				BROWN
		If Prince Albert were here today, he'd
		tell him a thing or two.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish
		it.
			(beat)
		The same people who refused to grant
		my husband the title of King because
		he was deemed of insufficient rank--

	She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		It is a fine spot for a bench, is it
		not?

				BROWN
		Aye, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.

	A pause.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I have some letters in the saddle bag. 
		I wish to read them.

	BROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands
	her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I cannot read them like that.

	BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again.  VICTORIA cuts in.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		You will hand them to me as I require.

	BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER
	SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS
	prepare to serve soup.

	ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
	next to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in.

	But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he
	goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
	down.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room
	stops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with
	a look.

	An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
	amazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,
	hurries up to intercede.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits
		there.

				BROWN
		Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		By whose authority?

				BROWN
		My own.

	A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness.  BERTIE'S VALET stares
	icily at him.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		The order of seating at the Upper
		Servant's table is arranged personally
		by the Queen herself.

				BROWN
		That's a tautology lad.
			(unable to stop himself
			 seriously explaining it)
		If you say the Queen arranges
		something, you've no need to say she's
		done it personally.  That's
		understood.

	But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He
	stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of
	the under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried
	exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.

	Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a
	substantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty
	assistant dresser, sitting to his right.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Are you dresser to Her Majesty?

	She blinks nervously at him.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Assistant, sir, yes.

	BROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits.

				BROWN
		What's your name?

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Mary Taylor, sir.

				BROWN
		Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		I hope to go up next year.

				BROWN
		You wouldn't happen to know what the
		Queen's reading for recreation, would
		you, Mary?

	The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Lord Tennyson, sir?

	BROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant
	bursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly
	from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The
	old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
	table.

	BROWN looks up from his soup.

				BROWN
		Am I the only one eating?

	With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.

	INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	A few days later.  A morning "drawing room."  Standing
	round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY
	CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that
	whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits
	knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat
	buttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself
	opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. 
	He runs through the daily itinerary.

				PONSONBY
		Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,
		at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve
		by a picnic in the grounds to
		celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. 
		Dispatches, as usual, at two.
			(finishes, then coughs)
		The Chancellor writes to say that, by
		happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes
		for the weekend.  He asks if Your
		Majesty might grant him an audience.

				VICTORIA
		Why?

				PONSONBY
		He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty
		might wish to be informed of the
		latest developments in government.

				VICTORIA
		No.  I shall be out walking.

	A beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs
	again, nervous.

				PONSONBY
		Then perhaps Your Majesty might
		consider it opportune if the Prince of
		Wales were to meet him on your behalf?

	VICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning.

				VICTORIA
		On no account.

	PONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up
	the reins.

				BERTIE
		Mama, I really do think it's time we
		made ourselves a little more ...
		available.

	VICTORIA carries on knitting.

				BERTIE (CONT'D)
		I think we must accept our position in
		the country is not entirely unrelated
		to the continued absence of the
		Monarchy from public life.
			(silence)
		I thought perhaps we might consider a
		small gesture of some kind?

	VICTORIA looks up sharply.

				VICTORIA
		Gesture?

				BERTIE
		I thought, a dinner for our
		ambassadors perhaps?

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in firmly)
		No dinners, Bertie.
			(beat)
		Why are you dressed for outdoors?

				BERTIE
		It's so infernally cold in here.

				VICTORIA
		Cold is good--
			(calling across)
		Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!

				JENNER
		I'm sorry, ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Cold is good!

				JENNER
		Excellent, ma'am, excellent.
			(trying his hand)
		But perhaps if her Majesty were to
		consider accompanying her new-found
		physical vigor with the benefits of
		mental activity...

				VICTORIA
			(becoming very agitated)
		Why am I being lectured in this way?!

				JENNER
		Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way
		did I wish to suggest--

				VICTORIA
			(cutting across him)
		I will not tolerate anybody lecturing
		me about the responsibility of the
		monarchy....

				BERTIE
		Mother....

				VICTORIA
		... Least of all my son.  It was his
		irresponsibility that drove my husband
		to his grave.

	An appalled silence.  With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs
	the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
	in another direction.

				BERTIE
		If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,
		then perhaps she might consider
		allowing the Prince of Wales to host--

				VICTORIA
		I do believe they send so many boxes
		to taunt me. 
		Doctor Jenner writes to them to say
		that my nerves are in an extremely
		fragile state and yet they continue to
		hound me with box after box after box
		after box after box!

	Silence.  VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out
	at the view.  Having recovered her composure, she turns to
	address them all.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I wish to take the Princesses for a
		swim.

	For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard.  She
	continues.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		The turns I have been taking in the
		grounds have proved most beneficial to
		me, and Brown thinks that salt water
		will do me good.

	Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR
	JENNER exchange a worried look.

	EXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen
	VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck
	into the freezing sea.  As she does so, the doors of the
	other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise
	follow her in.  Dignity does not allow them to shout out,
	but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.

	VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little
	circle.

				VICTORIA
		Don't potter, children.  Swim.

	Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.

	EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

	Half an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and
	two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and
	onto her horse.  He glances at the stiff line of
	householders and mutters curtly to himself.

				BROWN
		You could buy that lot for garden
		ornaments and still see change from
		ten guineas.

	The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has
	overheard and tries to suppress a smile. 
	As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose. 
	BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Lift your foot, woman.

	Everyone hears this.  VICTORIA obeys.  Taking the reins, he
	then walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard.  As they vanish
	from site, we hear...

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		This nation is fortunate in so much as
		it is not governed by force...

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "1866"

						FADE IN:

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

	The speech continues as we follow the progress of a
	Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches
	from knee to knee.  It is entitled, "Where is Britannia?"
	and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		... but by a chain of traditions that
		have been cherished from generation to
		generation, because in them -- in our
		traditions -- are embodied all the
		laws which have enabled us to create
		the greatest empire of modern times...

	During the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and
	lands on the knees of the young, earnest STANLEY.  As he
	frowns at the picture in front of him, DISRAELI winds up.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		... but, even though we have amassed
		great capital and even though we have
		established an industry with no
		parallel in the world, yet all these
		mighty creations are as nothing
		compared to the invisible customs that
		shape our lives.  To those honorable
		gentlemen of the opposition who seek
		to destroy the essential elements of
		this country, I say let them remember:
		England cannot begin again.

	During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time. 
	He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like
	Dickens on Slimfast.  He dresses almost dandyishly but
	speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance
	and cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back
	benchers, he sits.

	As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the
	Liberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every
	respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.  They stare
	levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
	smile.

	STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap.

				STANLEY
		Have you seen this?

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY

	A few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling
	down the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory
	back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
	offer their congratulations.

				STANLEY
		Should we take it seriously?

				DISRAELI
		The cartoon or Her Majesty's
		absenteeism?

				STANLEY
		Well, both.

				DISRAELI
		The question is, do we need her?

				STANLEY
		Surely, you're not suggesting we
		dispense--

				DISRAELI
		My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with
		only a handful of friends must respect
		public opinion.

	The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was
		right.  This country is not governed
		by wisdom but by talk.
			(beat)
		Granted, it wouldn't take much to
		winkle the old girl out of mourning,
		but if public opinion is against her,
		then it doesn't do to appear too
		close.

				STANLEY
		So?

				DISRAELI
		We'll see which way the wind blows.

	DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.

	EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.  It is freezing. 
	BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing
	Burns at the sea.

				BROWN
		My heart's in the Highlands, my heart
		is not here!  My heart's in the
		Highlands a-chasing the deer!  Chasing
		the wild deer and following the roe! 
		My heart's in the Highlands wherever I
		go!

	ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns.

	EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the
	cold beach to rub themselves dry.  BROWN is very energized.

				BROWN
		One box of biscuits, one box of drop
		tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen
		chocolate sponges.  It's the same
		order every week, but does anybody
		bother to check it?  Now she has to
		travel all the way to Balmoral without
		the few luxuries she actually enjoys.

				ARCHIE
		So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.

				BROWN
		Aye, but will they?

				ARCHIE
		John, it's not your problem what she
		eats.

				BROWN
		The woman's surrounded by fools!
			(beat)
		She has to be packed and ready to
		leave by seven thirty tomorrow
		morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll
		still be dressing her at eight.

	BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his
	brother.

				ARCHIE
		She's got an army of people to get her
		up and out.

				BROWN
		But I'm the only one she trusts.

	ARCHIE stares at him.  A beat.

				ARCHIE
		She'll blow hot and cold on you, John,
		she always does.  You want to be
		careful.

				BROWN
		I'm on ninety pounds a year plus
		seventy pounds for a pile of tartan
		I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much
		as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and
		that job's only for toffs.
			(raising his hip flask
			 triumphantly at the sea)
		I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! 
		Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping
		me now.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT

	A few days later.

	The clatter of carriage and horse as the ROYAL PARTY
	thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle.

	CAPTION: "BALMORAL"

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - TWILIGHT

	A mass of torches encircle the ROYAL PARTY as kilted
	GHILLIES and STAFF swarm round the carriage, opening doors
	and clambering off boxes while a regiment of PIPERS play
	them in.

	Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the
	door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by
	PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE.  Emerging from another
	carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim
	faced at the castle.  HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER
	alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves
	and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.

				PONSONBY
		Oh God, not the pipes!

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The next day.

	High over the vast, bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch
	Muick.  VICTORIA and BROWN are riding fast towards the top. 
	Reaching the summit, VICTORIA points excitedly at the far
	horizon.

				VICTORIA
		What are those?

				BROWN
		What?

				VICTORIA
		Those, over there, there.

				BROWN
			(horse chestnut trees...)
		Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.

				VICTORIA
			(beat)
		Craobhan-geanmchno...
			(bursts out laughing)
		How can I possibly say that with a
		straight face?!

	BROWN lets it go and they ride on.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I am thinking of publishing my
		"Highland Journals."

				BROWN
		Are they worth reading?

				VICTORIA
			(beat)
		I am told so.

				BROWN
		Who by?

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are
		charming.

				BROWN
		What does he know about the Highlands?

				VICTORIA
		He has been attending at Balmoral for
		many years.

				BROWN
		That doesn't make him an expert.

				VICTORIA
		His remarks were directed at the
		quality of the writing, not its
		subject.

				BROWN
		I don't groom a horse to have it
		admired by others, I groom it because
		it needs grooming.

				VICTORIA
			(curtly)
		I do not do it for others.  But
		Ponsonby thinks they are good.

				BROWN
		Just say what you have to say, woman. 
		What other people think shouldn't
		matter to you.

				VICTORIA
			(snapping)
		Of course I shall say what I have to
		say.  I always do.

	The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on.

				BROWN
		Aye, well, if all you want is a good
		opinion then he'd be sure to oblige
		you.

				VICTORIA
			(riding alongside)
		What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was
		their literary merit, a skill not
		intimately associated with the
		knowledge of grooming.
			(beat)
		Literary appreciation does not begin
		and end with Tennyson.

	BROWN lowers his head.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
			(in a softer tone)
		I mention you in them.

	BROWN says nothing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		In particular, the occasion when
		Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage
		overturned during a storm and you
		demonstrated such loyal service in
		returning the Queen and the Princesses
		safely to Balmoral.

	Taking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds
	it out to him.  A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		For friendship.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	A few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand
	at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary.

				BROWN
			(briskly)
		She'll be away on Friday between eight
		o'clock and six in the evening to
		visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's
		to make the journey there and back in
		the day she's to have no distractions
		the night before.  She'll take a light
		supper alone in her private drawing
		room and retire early.

				PONSONBY
		She'll need to sign dispatches before
		she retires.

				BROWN
		That can wait till the weekend.

				PONSONBY
		There are important papers from --

				BROWN
		It can wait.  Anything else?

				JENNER
		Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such
		a long journey?  She has only just
		recovered from a severe head cold.

				BROWN
		If I thought she wasn't up to it, I
		wouldn't let her go, would I?

	BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving
	PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	The next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the
	grounds.  VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one
	side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.

	BERTIE is in mid-plea.

				BERTIE
		Surely it is for the gentlemen to
		decide when to stop...

				VICTORIA
		It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It
		should be discouraged.

				BERTIE
		Yes, but isn't midnight a little
		excessive?

				VICTORIA
		It is quite late enough.

				BERTIE
		But mama, the room was built expressly
		for that purpose.  It has been a
		smoking-room by tradition ever since
		father --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in angrily)
		Brown's responsibilities are onerous
		enough already.  He has far too much
		to do without having to stay up all
		night waiting for you to go to bed. 
		The smoking-room will be closed and
		the lights put out at twelve o'clock.

				BERTIE
		Mama...

				VICTORIA
		And that is my last word on the
		matter.

				BERTIE
		Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think
		it's too much that the gentlemen of
		the house should be dictated to by a
		servant.

				BROWN
		It's the Queen's decision.

				BERTIE
		I beg your pardon?
			(to VICTORIA)
		Mama...?

	Before Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his
	face.

				BROWN
		I think you should go now.
			(beat)
		You've tired your mother enough.

	BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.  He glances at
	his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if
	she has not heard.  BERTIE turns and storms away.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	JOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage
	watching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple,
	MR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying
	desperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden
	visit.  They fling open the windows, slosh water on the
	fire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions,
	dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
	up, all in the space of a few seconds.

				BROWN
		There's really no need for this.

				MRS GRANT
		I'll not have her seeing it like it
		is!
			(beat)
		I know she means well, but I wish
		she'd warn us she was coming.

				BROWN
		She thinks if she warned you, you'd go
		pouring water on the fire and stuffing
		the knitting under the sofa.

				MR GRANT
		Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being
		house-proud.

	MRS GRANT surveys the room critically.

				MRS GRANT
		All right.
			(beat)
		Show her in.

	EXT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA sits on a horse and trap.  BROWN steps out and
	helps her down.

				BROWN
		They're ready now.

				VICTORIA
		I hope they didn't go to any trouble,
		John.

				BROWN
		Ah, well...

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one
	military row, smoke still steaming off the fire.  BROWN
	stands behind her, barely able to contain himself.  But for
	VICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as
	perfectly normal.

				VICTORIA
		Mr Grant.  How good it is to see you.

				MR GRANT
			(bowing deeply)
		Your Majesty.

				VICTORIA
		Mrs Grant.  How is your knee?  Has the
		pain eased a little?

				MRS GRANT
			(bobbing in terror)
		Oh not so bad, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Good.  Oh and here are Douglas and
		John.  Haven't you grown?

				MRS GRANT
			(still bobbing away)
		Growing all the time, ma'am.

	MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a
	chair.

				MR GRANT
		Will you sit, ma'am?

	From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she
	smiles as she is led to the chair.  She points to a picture
	on the wall and her good humour is infectious.

				VICTORIA
		I know that!  That's Cairn Lochan.  We
		picnicked there once, did we not,
		John?

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS,
	DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES.  Into this
	brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the
	young STANLEY.  It is all eyes and nods here.  Everyone
	knows everyone.

				DISRAELI
		Ah, the greasy pole.

				MARY ANNE
		Don't be facetious, dear. Remember
		your position.

				DISRAELI
		It's my position I'm thinking of.

	Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of
	acolytes.

				STANLEY
		I see the Prince of Wales is here.

				DISRAELI
		I hope he got his mother's permission.

	STANLEY smiles faintly.  DISRAELI homes in on a punter and
	raises his hand, already working the room.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		Lord Salisbury!

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	The society party is hotting up.  STANLEY is deep in
	conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
			(ridiculously pleased with
			 herself)
		Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound
		foolish?  Because she looks after the
		Browns and lets the sovereigns take
		care of themselves!

	A peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up.

				DISRAELI
		And in your opinion?  Is she foolish?

	The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
		Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's
		hardly right, is it?

				DISRAELI
		What?

				SOCIETY LADY 1
		Well, the Queen and --
			(appalled whisper)
		Mr Brown.

	DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.

				DISRAELI
		La superstition met le monde entier en
		flammes.

				SOCIETY LADY 2
			(thick as shit)
		I beg your pardon?

				DISRAELI
			(changing tack)
		Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown?

				STANLEY
		He is her personal servant, I believe.

				SOCIETY LADY 1
			(knowingly)
		Follows her wherever she goes.

				DISRAELI
		He would hardly make a very good
		personal assistant if he did not.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of
	QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS
	GRANT nervously prattles on.

				MRS GRANT
		... it's not my best china.  I mean,
		it is my best china now, but the
		family set got stolen last summer.

				VICTORIA
		Oh, I'm so sorry ...

				MRS GRANT
		Of course it was no-one on the Estate. 
		More likely one of the lads from
		Braemar.  Or further even.
			(beat)
		I'll fetch the salt.

	MRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the
	spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside
	the plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries
	on.

	INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

	DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES.

				BERTIE
		Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.

				DISRAELI
		Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure
		to see you here.

				BERTIE
		Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in
		sugar...?

				DISRAELI
		I don't think I've had that pleasure.

	DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles
	with drink.  MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while
	BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.

				BERTIE
		No doubt you've heard the rumors.

				DISRAELI
		I take no account of gossip, Your
		Highness.

				BERTIE
		My concern is for the reputation of
		the Monarchy.

				DISRAELI
		Of course.

				BERTIE
		I fear the influence he has on her. 
		The man's word is not to be credited. 
		He is an arriviste of the very lowest
		water.
			(beat)
		She's having a bust cast of him.  In
		Nero Marquino marble.

				DISRAELI
		I see.

				BERTIE
		I would talk to her myself, but she
		won't listen to me.  She must be
		persuaded, by someone she respects, to
		abandon this ridiculous favoritism
		before a situation develops.

				DISRAELI
		A situation?

				BERTIE
		I don't imagine you frequent the
		Republican Clubs.  But the fact that
		neither you nor I are members should
		not blind us to the significance of
		their existence.
			(beat)
		The Tory Party has always been our
		party.

				DISRAELI
		I'm flattered you think so.

				BERTIE
		I tell you, if we don't stick together
		on this, you could find yourself First
		President's Opposition.
			(murdering it)
		Du Royaum Uni.

				DISRAELI
		Quite.

	A beat.

				BERTIE
		I don't think we can overstate the
		seriousness of this.

	DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party. 
	The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.

				STANLEY
		What did he want?

				DISRAELI
		To know when he'll be king.

	INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

	VICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large
	table.  Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams
	proudly at BROWN as he tells a story.

				BROWN
		... so Grant here and myself are
		riding over Lochnagar and the rain's
		pouring down in sheets and all we're
		thinking about is getting home for a
		drink, when through the gloom Grant
		spots a couple of poachers.  He gives
		me a shout and we chase them down
		towards the loch until Grant has your
		men up against the stacks and he's
		shouting and cursing at them, "Why are
		you poaching on Royal land?!"  And one
		of the little fellas looks up at him
		and says, "coz we've come up in the
		world."

	For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then
	BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS
	relax.  Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. 
	Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal
	quantities of whiskey all round.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DUSK

	Later that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of
	worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps.

	Through the light, BROWN and VICTORIA clatter into the
	courtyard on the horse and trap.  DOCTOR JENNER breaks
	through the crowd in a state of high excitement.

				JENNER
		Your Majesty!  Thank goodness you're
		safe!  I'll have a bath prepared
		immediately.  I recommend Macdonald's
		African Embrocation --

				BROWN
			(cutting in)
		Ah, pipe down, man.  The woman's fine.

				VICTORIA
		We stayed a little longer than
		expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It
		was most agreeable.

				PONSONBY
		We were expecting you to return by
		six.

				VICTORIA
		And now I am back.

	BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.

				BROWN
		We took a nip of whiskey.

				VICTORIA
		To keep out the cold.

				BROWN
		Aye.

	VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before
	walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...

				VICTORIA
		Thank you, John.

	BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up,
	he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in
	utter disbelief at what she has just said.  He turns and
	leads the horse back to the stables.

				JENNER
			(under his breath)
		She's drunk.

	PONSONBY doesn't answer.  He is watching BROWN very
	closely.

				JENNER (CONT'D)
		A distinct flushing around the cheeks. 
		She was drunk, I tell you.

				PONSONBY
		No, she wasn't.

	Silence.  JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY.

				JENNER
		Surely not ...

	PONSONBY's face is set hard.

				PONSONBY
		Don't even think about it.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

	A crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of
	the annual Ghillie's Ball.

	The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them
	beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and
	JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.

	PONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching.  Close-up
	on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly.

				JENNER
		Pandora's Box ...

	With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and
	BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence. 
	A King and his Queen.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Later that night.

	We find BROWN, slouched on the ground, dead-drunk and
	snoring loudly.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	A few days later, four JOURNALISTS are scrabbling up a
	stony path, armed with telescopes.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	A large ROYAL PARTY is making its way smoothly and quietly
	up the mountain.  BROWN is on horseback, leading VICTORIA
	on a dapple-grey.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS rattle up the hill.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS scramble up to some gorse bushes, dump
	themselves down and start setting up the telescopes.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	BROWN and VICTORIA near the summit when BROWN suddenly
	stops.  He stiffens and turns to face the wind, as if
	catching a scent.  VICTORIA frowns.

				VICTORIA
		What is it, John?
			(beat)
		John?

				BROWN
		I heard something.

	BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		I won't be long.

	He dismounts and races off.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	The JOURNALISTS are peering through their telescopes.

				JOURNALIST 1
		Where did he get to?  I've lost him?

	Below them, BROWN races across the riverbank and
	undergrowth, unseen.

				JOURNALIST 2
		I don't know if there's much worth
		writing about.

				JOURNALIST 1
		Hard to tell.

	BROWN rears up above them and stops.

				BROWN
		This close enough for you?  Go on!  On
		your way!  You filthy scavengers!

	The JOURNALISTS scramble to their feet and start legging it
	down the hill, while BROWN roars furiously, hurling their
	bags after them.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		You leave her alone, do you hear?!

	The JOURNALISTS vanish below the hillside.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	That night.

	BROWN is standing at the head of the table, yelling at the
	UPPER SERVANTS, irrespective of ARCHIE or anyone.

				BROWN
		If I catch the miserable by-blow who
		told those men where she'd be, then
		I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock
		Wemyss, so I will!!

	ARCHIE glances up at BERTIE'S VALET.  He is staring down at
	the table, teeth gritted, fists clenched.  BROWN rounds on
	them all again.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		What happens to John Brown is his
		business, but the Queen's security
		will never be compromised!

				BERTIE'S VALET
		We --

				BROWN
		You'll talk when I'm finished!

	BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns
	back to the table.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		That kind of disloyalty will not be
		tolerated in this house, is that
		clear?
			(beat, yelling)
		I said, is that clear?!

	There is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and
	storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

	A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to
	his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his
	copy of Punch.

				JENNER
		"Court Circular, Balmoral."
			(beat)
		"On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a
		display of sheep-dipping by local
		farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a
		seance where he was pleased to listen
		to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr
		Robert Burns himself ..."

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same
	journal.

				JENNER (O.S.)
		"... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked
		on the slopes, accompanied by family
		and friend ..."

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door.

				JENNER (O.S.)
		Mr Brown retired early.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

	BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his
	copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled.

				BROWN
		If I find out that you had anything to
		do with this, I will have you sacked.

				PONSONBY
		I believe that decision rests with Her
		Majesty.

				BROWN
		Don't think I can't persuade her.

				PONSONBY
		I don't doubt that the Queen was
		highly amused.  She has always had a
		very healthy sense of humor.

				BROWN
		This is a slur on her good name.

				PONSONBY
		In as much as the article is about
		yourself, I think you must now accept
		that the public has a right to its
		interest in you.

				BROWN
		Nobody has any rights over me.

				PONSONBY
		We are all of us subject to forces
		beyond our control, Mr Brown, even
		you.

	BROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat.

				BROWN
		You'll regret saying that.

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

	Chaos.  The Tories are losing the vote as both sides of the
	house stand and shout at each other while the SPEAKER rises
	in his chair.

				SPEAKER (O.S.)
		Order!  Order!  ORDER!

	A buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote. 
	The COUNTERS approach the chair.

				SPEAKER (CONT'D)
		Result of the vote to the first
		reading of the Bill to Disestablish
		the Irish Church.

	A murmur of excitement from the LIBERALS.

				SPEAKER (CONT'D)
		Order!

	A beat.

				COUNTER
		Ayes to the right, three hundred and
		thirty, noes to the left, two hundred
		and sixty-five...

	By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in
	cheers from the Liberal benches.  DISRAELI and the rest of
	the front bench sit in stony silence.

	Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed
	maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting:

				DILKE
		Mr Speaker, I table a motion in
		furtherance of the Bill to
		Disestablish the Monarchy!

	A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again.

				SPEAKER
		Order!  Order!!  ORDER!!!

	INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	An hour later the house is empty except for a few
	straggling MPs hurrying home.  An exhausted DISRAELI stands
	in the corridor with STANLEY.

				DISRAELI
		We're going to lose.

				STANLEY
		You can't know that for sure.

				DISRAELI
		Gladstone's got his party facing the
		same way for the first time in years. 
		We need help.
			(long beat)
		Where is the old girl?

				STANLEY
		Who?

				DISRAELI
		Mrs Brown.

				STANLEY
		It's questionable whether there's any
		advantage to be had from that
		direction.  She's never been less
		popular.

				DISRAELI
		In the press, perhaps.
			(holding up Punch)
		But she's sold more copies of her
		Highland Journal in three months than
		Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time
		to wheel her out.

				STANLEY
		She's refusing to leave Balmoral.

				DISRAELI
		What's her excuse this time?

				STANLEY
		The Princess Louisa is too ill to
		move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather
		upset at the recent spate of bad
		publicity.
			(beat)
		You're smiling.

				DISRAELI
		I was trying to imagine "rather
		upset."

	The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the
	lobby doors.  DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.

				DISRAELI
		Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to
		spare the time.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		I came as quickly as I could.

				DISRAELI
		You've seen the latest cartoon in
		Punch, I take it?

				DEAN WELLSELLY
			(completely lost)
		I beg your pardon?

	DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean
	Wellselly.  The Dean clears his throat and starts to read.

				DISRAELI
			(as Wellselly reads)
		One of our madder brethren in the
		house was calling for disestablishment
		of the monarchy.

	Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Good Lord.

				STANLEY
			(playing the soft glove)
		I'm sure it won't come to that.

				DISRAELI
			(the hard glove)
		No.  But it has now become a matter
		for our consciences.
			(beat)
		I was just telling Stanley how vital
		it is that the nation should feel the
		visible influence of the Sovereign. 
		As a reminder that Parliament, indeed
		my own ministry, depends on the will
		of the Queen.

	DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely.  Over his shoulder,
	STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the
	party political maneuver into a moral imperative.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		I couldn't agree with you more, but I
		am only Dean of Windsor.  I don't
		understand what ...

	DISRAELI interrupts.

				DISRAELI
		We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is
		interesting Her Majesty in some of the
		forms of worship associated with ...
		low-church Presbyterian.

	Silence.  DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of
	unrestrained horror.  Low-church.  Presbyterian.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		What can we do?

				DISRAELI
		Oh, several things.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Some days later.

	Queen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands
	in front of her, holding a copy of The Times.

				VICTORIA
		Read it.

				PONSONBY
		Again?

				VICTORIA
		Read it!

	PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.

				PONSONBY
		"The Times wishes to join the rest of
		Her Majesty's loyal subjects in
		expressing its deep joy at the news
		that the Queen is soon to come out of
		her mourning."

	VICTORIA glowers at him.

				VICTORIA
		Who told them that?

				PONSONBY
		I have no idea.

				VICTORIA
		Why not?

				PONSONBY
		I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser
		than yourself.

	Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him.

				VICTORIA
		No-one should think themselves wiser
		than me!
			(beat)
		It is not for any of the Queen's
		subjects to presume to tell Her
		Majesty when and where She should come
		out of mourning.  It is the Queen's
		sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is
		Her overwhelming amount of work and
		responsibility, work which She feels
		will soon wear her out entirely!

				PONSONBY
		Your Majesty --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting right through him)
		Is it not enough that She is uncheered
		and unguided that she should also have
		to suffer these malicious rumors?!
			(a pause, more quietly)
		I am not a fool.
			(beat)
		I know there are those in the
		establishment too afraid to attack me
		and so they attack my dearest friends. 
		Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all
		I have left of Albert.
			(beat)
		And now they attack Brown too.

	She looks up, eyes blazing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I will not give him up to them.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, ROOM ADJOINING DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	BROWN is guarding the door to the drawing room while the
	balding BERTIE muscles up, eye ball to eye ball.

				BERTIE
		I wish to see my mother.

				BROWN
		She's busy.

				BERTIE
		Convey her a message.

				BROWN
		She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk
		to her there.

				BERTIE
		Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to
		speak with her urgently about matters
		concerning the press.

				BROWN
		Are you deaf as well as stupid?

	A split-second.  BERTIE gapes at him.

				BERTIE
		What did you say?

				BROWN
		I said, are you deaf as well as
		stupid?

				BERTIE
		Do you know who you address, sir?

				BROWN
		Whom you address.

				BERTIE
		The future King!

	A beat.

				BROWN
		Well, everyone's entitled to their
		opinion.

				BERTIE
		Out of my way!

	Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past.  Suddenly
	BROWN loses it completely.  He grabs the Prince of Wales by
	the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his
	face.

				BROWN
		LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!

	For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he
	has gone too far.  A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face,
	then ...

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

	Weeks later.

	In a roar of hooves and wheels, the Royal Carriage sweeps
	into the huge quadrangle.  JOHN BROWN stands rigid on the
	box, glowering at all the world.

	CAPTION: "WINDSOR"

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass
	of SERVANTS rush in and out, ferrying bags an trunks.

	BROWN marches in, still charged-up from the strain of the
	journey's watchfulness.  He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching
	a break.

				BROWN
		You!  What's your business here?!

				UNDER-PORTER
			(jumping to)
		Under-porter, sir.

				BROWN
		Well, don't stand where you shouldn't!

	The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs.  A few SERVANTS
	exchange looks.  BROWN seems more determined than ever to
	exert his control.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

	That night.

	Carrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks
	towards the stables.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

	The next day.

	BROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the
	grounds.  He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right,
	searching for intruders.  They are being followed at a
	distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback.  VICTORIA frowns
	peevishly.

				VICTORIA
		Must they always follow us?

				BROWN
		I ordered it.  It's for your own
		safety.

				VICTORIA
		Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch
		what I eat next.

	BROWN doesn't react.  A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Am I not safe enough with you, John?

				BROWN
		Aye.
			(looking away)
		But there are Fenians reported on the
		mainland.

				VICTORIA
			(tutting irritably)
		The threat from the Irish is greatly
		exaggerated, I'm sure.

				BROWN
			(snapping back)
		I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

	BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the
	conversation.  A beat.  He pulls up suddenly, staring at
	the shadows in the copse.

				VICTORIA
		Is anything the matter, John?
			(beat)
		John?

	He stares for along moment and then lets it go.

				BROWN
		Nothing's the matter.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

	BROWN marches down the line of horse boxes.  A stable-lad,
	BARNEY, is feeding the horses.  He looks twitchy.

				BROWN
		Hey, Barney.

				BARNEY
		Mr Brown, sir --

				BROWN
		It's cold out there tonight, Barney.

	Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.  The animal
	lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Yeah, there's a good girl.
			(to Barney)
		Have you had a look at this hoof?  She
		was limping badly.  I think there
		might be a stone in it.

				BARNEY
		Yeah, yeah, I did.

				BROWN
		Good man.  And is she all right?

				BARNEY
		Yeah.

				BROWN
		Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? 
		Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you
		know the Queen's riding tomorrow?

				BARNEY
		Yeah.

				BROWN
			(beat)
		Are you all right, Barney?

	BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.  The
	split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Oh, aye...

	The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight.

	As he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a
	fist and fling the others off him.  But the FIRST MAN is up
	again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back. 
	The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly
	strong.  Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them
	fight to force him back.  BARNEY stands transfixed in
	horror.

	Dumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start
	kicking the shit out of him.  BROWN curls into a ball, jaw
	locked, hands over his head.  Not a sound.

	Finally, they back off, panting hard.  The FIRST MAN pulls
	out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces
	whiskey down his throat.  It spills over his face and
	dribbles down his neck.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.

	VICTORIA is standing at the windows.  The door opens and
	LADY ELY walks in.

				VICTORIA
		Well?

				LADY ELY
		Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

				VICTORIA
		Why?

				LADY ELY
		I believe he is unwell, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Unwell?

				LADY ELY
		I understand he was in a fight.

				VICTORIA
		Has he been hurt?

				LADY ELY
		I believe not, ma'am.  I understand --
		he'd had rather too much to drink.

	VICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk.

				VICTORIA
		You may go.

	LADY ELY bows and walks out.  VICTORIA stares at the desk a
	moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work.  She
	cannot.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

	BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his
	undergarments.  His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid
	with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting
	his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending
	to his wounds.

				BROWN
		And she sent no word down?

				ARCHIE
		They said you were drunk.
			(beat)
		Why don't you tell her the truth?

				BROWN
		She'll think it's her fault for
		keeping me.

	ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly
	reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.

				ARCHIE
		What are you doing?!

				BROWN
		I'm getting dressed.

				ARCHIE
		You've got three broken ribs, man!

				BROWN
		I've got my duties to attend to.

				ARCHIE
		Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit
		state to go anywhere.

				BROWN
		She'll be worried about me.

				ARCHIE
		She'll get over it.

				BROWN
		I can't let her down now, Archie.

				ARCHIE
		And when was the last time she put
		herself out for you?  Look, John,
		whatever she says to you now, in the
		end you're still a servant.

				BROWN
		Oh, I'm much more than that.

				ARCHIE
		Aye, she may say that to you, but the
		woman can say what she wants.

				BROWN
		You watch your tongue.

				ARCHIE
		Come on, man, I'm telling you what you
		already know.

				BROWN
		You know nothing about her!

				ARCHIE
		When are you gonna see it, John?  She
		doesn't give a damn about you.

	BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card
	showing a coy picture of a pretty woman.  He holds it up,
	eyes blazing.

				BROWN
		From the Queen!

	He reads out the inscription.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		My lips may give a message better of
		Christmas love than e'en this letter.
			(beat)
		To my best friend, J.B. from his best
		friend, V.R.
			(he thrusts it in his
			 brother's face)
		Best friend!

				ARCHIE
		Aye.

				BROWN
		She means it.

	ARCHIE stares at him.

				ARCHIE
		She'll drop you.  When she's done with
		you, she'll drop you.

				BROWN
		Get out.
			(beat)
		Out!

	ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		OUT!!

	ARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.  VICTORIA sits at her desk.  PONSONBY hands
	her letters to sign.

				PONSONBY
		... to be followed by a visit from
		Lady Bridport.  She is keen to secure
		a place for her niece as Maid of
		Honor.

	VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.

				VICTORIA
		I am tired.

	PONSONBY coughs.

				PONSONBY
		There is one other matter.

				VICTORIA
		What is it?

				PONSONBY
		I have a letter, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		From whom?

				PONSONBY
		From Princess Helena and other members
		of your family.

				VICTORIA
			(stiffening defensively)
		My family is quite capable of
		communicating with the Queen in
		person.

	PONSONBY does not reply.  Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to
	ask.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		What do they want?

				PONSONBY
		They are demanding the dismissal of
		John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.

	VICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

	VICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel, nervously
	fingering her handkerchief.  Waiting for her, smiling
	softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		You wished to see me, ma'am?

	She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

	A few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated
	in a corner of the chapel, talking softly.  She cannot
	bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how
	carefully he is watching her throughout the interview. 
	This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles
	to be as honest as possible.

				VICTORIA
		My husband tried always to make me
		think more subtly.  Of course he
		taught me so much and I can never
		repay my debt to him, or the love I
		feel, even now.  But, in truth, I
		think I am someone who can only feel
		things while they are alive to me. 
		For that reason, I know I do not have
		a subtle mind.  I know that.  But I
		work hard and I try to do my duty.
			(she hesitates; she is
			 struggling now)
		However, I have noticed of late that
		my feelings of grief are not so strong
		and -- that I find myself leaning more
		upon the comfort of living friends.
			(beat)
		Friends close to me now.

	She stops herself.  She is crying.  DEAN WELLSELLY watches
	her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words
	carefully.

				DEAN WELLSELLY
		Your Majesty, a settled resignation is
		more lasting proof of affection than
		active grief.  If the good Lord sees
		fit to bring one into contact with
		congenial fellow beings, one should
		not analyze one's reaction too deeply. 
		To allow oneself to be comforted by
		someone else need not imply any
		disloyalty to the memory of the loved
		one.

	Silence.  VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel. 
	Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her
	disappointment turns to anger.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

	The next day, VICTORIA stands at the far window and her
	back to the room.  Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and
	his siblings.

				VICTORIA
		Sir Henry.

	PONSONBY steps forward.

				PONSONBY
		Ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Please tell the Princess, and other
		signatories to this letter, that the
		Queen will not be dictated to, or made
		to alter, in any way, what she has
		found to answer for her comfort.
			(beat)
		Do I make myself clear?

				PONSONBY
		Ma'am.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA
		You may go.

	They all file out.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

	A few days later.

	BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback.  Although
	better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised. 
	They turn a corner banked by trees.  BROWN is watching the
	QUEEN closely.  She stops.

				VICTORIA
		I would like to get down.

	Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her
	horse.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		John?

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		I was told you were in a fight.

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Has someone seen to those bruises?

				BROWN
		Yes, ma'am.

	A beat.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Ma'am?

				VICTORIA
		Yes?

				BROWN
		Having considered my position here at
		court, I have come to the conclusion
		that it is in the best interest of
		Your Majesty that I should resign.

				VICTORIA
		I do not accept.

	A beat.

				BROWN
		I had foreseen that you would not. 
		But Your Majesty should understand --
		that my mind will not be changed in
		this.  I leave for Deeside --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in)
		The Queen forbids it.
			(beat)
		I cannot allow it because I cannot
		live without you.  Without you, I
		cannot find the strength to be who I
		must be.  Please.

	She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then
	looks at him, utterly helpless.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Promise me you won't let them send me
		back.

	A long silence.  BROWN holds her hand tight.

				BROWN
		I promise.

	Reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors
	bang behind him.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	The next day.

	QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with
	great vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish
	ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,
	almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE
	LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand
	in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. 
	Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a
	quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.

	DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards
	off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician
	to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This
	man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his
	smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she
	belts, until her children are drowned out completely.

	And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops
	playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The
	HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,
	but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.

				VICTORIA
		How dare the Irish break with the
		Anglicans? 
		If Albert were alive today he would
		never allow the Crown to give up
		Church patronage.  No, the Irish must
		be told, very firmly, to stay exactly
		where they are.  It is the thin edge
		of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.  Next, you
		will be telling me that the Crown no
		longer governs this nation.

	A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.

				DISRAELI
		Your Majesty remains at the very
		epicenter of governance.  As for your
		people, look no further than the sales
		of your Highland Journals to see in
		what affection the nation holds their
		Queen.
			(beat)
		You sell even more copies than Mr
		Dickens.

				VICTORIA
		But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.

	VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.  DISRAELI acknowledges it,
	then steers the conversation back.

				DISRAELI
		Of course I understand your concern. 
		You miss your people.
			(a pause)
		And they miss you.

	VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the
	implied criticism.

				VICTORIA
		Then they may read about me.

				DISRAELI
		Indeed, and for that they are
		eternally grateful.

				VICTORIA
		Is that not enough?

				DISRAELI
		In so many ways ... and yet it is your
		presence they crave.  A figurehead.

	VICTORIA has the measure of him.

				VICTORIA
		I never thought to be bullied by you,
		Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought,
		understood a widow's grief.

				DISRAELI
		Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for
		the nation, only for myself.  As Prime
		Minister I confess I miss your
		presence, but that is only an
		expression of my own selfish desires
		and I should not burden you with it.

	The Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA
	acknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks
	directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.

				VICTORIA
		I stay here because I am happy.
			(beat)
		Is that such a terrible crime?

				DISRAELI
		No, ma'am.

	At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.

				BROWN
		Time for your walk.

	Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts
	following him out.  As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.

				VICTORIA
		This is my good John Brown.

				DISRAELI
			(taking him in)
		Yes.

				VICTORIA
		I have asked him to show you a little
		of Highland life while you are with us
		at Balmoral.

	BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.

				BROWN
		What brings you here?

				DISRAELI
		A man can refuse only so many
		invitations from his Queen.  It was
		remiss of me not to come earlier.

	VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN stares.

				BROWN
		What do you know about the Highlands?

				DISRAELI
		I am a blank sheet.

				BROWN
		Do you hunt?

				DISRAELI
		Occasionally.

				BROWN
		Dare say you can be taught.

				DISRAELI
		To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

				BROWN
		If you hunt, you kill.

	DISRAELI counters effortlessly.

				DISRAELI
		Well then, I'll do my best.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of
	shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against
	heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud,
	crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly
	cold.

	Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. 
	The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way up
	the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and
	dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then
	the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front.

	Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up
	the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men
	on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other
	GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them
	ARCHIE.

	Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts.

	He listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his
	quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen
	dismount as quietly as they can.

	As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his
	side.  He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and
	drinks.  All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	The stalking.

	Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to
	each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill.

	DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes
	on his man, trying to make no sound.

	Suddenly, BROWN stops.  Very slowly he rises.  DISRAELI
	rides alongside and sees ...

	A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside.

	Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his
	rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.  With a
	deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines.  BROWN
	stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his
	shoulder and fires.

	EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

	The kill.

	A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ...

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his
	side.

				BROWN
			(demonstrating with his
			 rifle)
		Always remember, you keep it tight to
		your shoulder, you absorb the kick. 
		Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's
		Gladstone.

				DISRAELI
			(smiling)
		Quite.

	BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who
	declines.  He watches BROWN take a long swig.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

	That night.

	BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.  He has
	a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list. 
	Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh,
	are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty
	ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIE'S VALET.  They each step up,
	one at a time, to make their report.

				BROWN
			(ticking as he goes)
		... Back doors, West Wing.

				UPPER SERVANT 1
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Side doors, East Wing.

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Louder, girl!

				ASSISTANT DRESSER
			(creasing up)
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Kitchen and lower house.

				BERTIE'S VALET
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Back and upper corridors.

				UPPER SERVANT 2
		Checked and locked, sir.

				BROWN
		Front door.
			(beat)
		Checked and locked.

	Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and
	sits.  On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid
	a clatter of cutlery and chat.

	ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched
	over his plate, pecking at his food.

	Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up.  BERTIE'S VALET
	coughs.  BROWN slowly lifts his head.  His eyes have the
	slightly unfocused look of too much drink.  It is clear to
	ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.

				BERTIE'S VALET
			(with a smug smile)
		Did you see any Irish assassins today,
		Mr Brown?

	Brown doesn't react.

				BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
		We heard the dogs were Fenian
		sympathizers.

	Brown drinks.

				BERTIE'S VALET (CONT'D)
		Or was it the stag ...?

	Everyone bursts out laughing.  Brown slams down his glass.

				BROWN
		There's not a soul here cares about
		that wee woman's safety except me! 
		She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there
		to look out for her --

	He stops.  ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair
	and pulls gently on his arm.

	BROWN stares at the SERVANTS.  Everyone is about to burst
	out laughing.  Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his
	chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away.

	As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in
	the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	BROWN is lying on a grubby bed.  ARCHIE is looking around
	the untidy room.  For the first time, he notices a thick
	manuscript on the table.  BROWN follows his eyes.

				ARCHIE
		What's this?

				BROWN
		It's a diary.

				ARCHIE
		Be careful who sees it.

				BROWN
		What do you take me for?

	ARCHIE turns back to BROWN.

				ARCHIE
		You should have someone look after
		you.

				BROWN
		I'm all right.  I just need to rest up
		a wee bit.
			(feeling everything spin)
		The room ... You don't have to stay.

	BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift.  ARCHIE watches
	over him.

				ARCHIE
		The place is a mess.

				BROWN
		I can't move to tidy.

				ARCHIE
		It's what the maids are for.

				BROWN
		I'm not having some prattler going
		through my things.

	A beat.

				ARCHIE
		Won't you give yourself a rest, John? 
		She's other people to look out for
		her.

				BROWN
		She needs me, Archie.  She canna do
		without me, she said it to my face.
			(his hands come up to cover
			 his eyes)
		How can I stop now?

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY

	Dawn the next morning.

	BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the
	stairs.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --
	to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up
	in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket.

				BROWN
		You sent for me.

				DISRAELI
		I've been called back to London.  My
		last day.  I thought I might take a
		walk on Lochnagar.

	BROWN stares straight back.

	EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

	An hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill.  BROWN has
	his head down, on with the job.  DISRAELI slows to a halt.

				DISRAELI
		Princes and Lords are but the breath
		of kings, An honest man's the noblest
		work of God.
			(beat)
		You must miss such magnificent views.

				BROWN
		I don't think about it.

	They reach the top and continue along the high ground. 
	DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp.

				DISRAELI
		Forgive me, I've called you out and
		you should have been resting.

				BROWN
		I'm fine.

				DISRAELI
		You're injured.

				BROWN
		It's nothing.

				DISRAELI
		Still, someone must attend you.  Your
		wife should not have let you out.

				BROWN
		I'm not married.

				DISRAELI
			(deadpan)
		Oh.

				BROWN
		This is the top.

	DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.

				DISRAELI
		I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am
		not married myself, I see my wife so
		little.  But I'm forgetting the
		rewards.

	He looks across.  BROWN keeps staring ahead.

				DISRAELI (CONT'D)
		The look on their faces when one walks
		into the room.  Still gives one a
		ridiculous thrill.

				BROWN
		I wouldn't know.

				DISRAELI
		Surely --

				BROWN
			(interrupts)
		What I do, I do for my Queen.

				DISRAELI
		Was there never ambition?

				BROWN
			(beat)
		Maybe, once.

				DISRAELI
		Then I envy yo.

				BROWN
		Why?

				DISRAELI
		To have achieved one's ambition, or to
		have reconciled oneself to its limits,
		is a lifetime's work.

				BROWN
		I do what I do.

				DISRAELI
		For Her Majesty.

				BROWN
		Aye.

				DISRAELI
		But yourself?
			(beat)
		What about John Brown?

				BROWN
		I said.
			(beat)
		I serve the Queen.

				DISRAELI
		No other aspiration?

	BROWN stares for a long moment.  Finally he speaks.

				BROWN
		To see her safe.

	DISRAELI steps a little closer.

				DISRAELI
		You will not be unaware of the threat
		now posed by Republicanism.

				BROWN
		Why do you think I keep her here?

				DISRAELI
		Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It
		is her very isolation that encourages
		the malcontents.  The longer she is
		away, the stronger they become; and
		who, honestly, can promise security
		against that?  However many doors you
		lock, someone will always get in. 
		Even here.

	BROWN watches him, eyes alert.

				BROWN
		So...?

				DISRAELI
		The truth is, the Queen would be safer
		doing her duty and returning south to
		her public.  John Bull loves her and
		John Bull is her best defense.

				BROWN
		Her mind is set.  She won't change
		now.

				DISRAELI
		She trusts you, John.

	DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.

				BROWN
		They don't see it.

				DISRAELI
		See what?

				BROWN
		The threat.
			(beat)
		I tell them, but they don't see it.

				DISRAELI
		They aren't as watchful as you.

				BROWN
		Too busy looking after themselves.

				DISRAELI
		The greasy pole.

				BROWN
		No loyalty.

				DISRAELI
		No love.

	Silence.  For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone
	else has said that.

				BROWN
		I promised to protect her from people
		like you.

				DISRAELI
		For once in my life, I am not the
		issue.

				BROWN
		She'll never understand it.

				DISRAELI
		In time, she will.

				BROWN
		She'll think I betrayed her.

				DISRAELI
		But others will know that you acted
		for the greater good.

	BROWN stares off into the distance.

	EXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY

	The next day.

	BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES
	wait on the shore.

	VICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the
	surface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them
	carefully through the water.  

				VICTORIA
		I received a letter today from Mr
		Disraeli.  Parliament is calling for
		my return to public duties.
			(beat)
		Why won't they let us be?

	BROWN does not answer.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		He insists that the country expects me
		to preside over the opening of the new
		session.  I refuse to offer sustenance
		to enable his weakening grip. 
		Besides, you know how much I should
		hate it.  It frightens me.

	She notices that BROWN has said nothing.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		John?

	BROWN does not look at her.  Finally:

				BROWN
		We can't always have what we wish.

	VICTORIA stares at him.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

	Later that day.

	VICTORIA and BROWN are in the middle of a blazing row in
	front of the entire Household, including PONSONBY, JENNER
	and LADY ELY.

				VICTORIA
		Duty?!  You talk about duty?!

				BROWN
		If duty and safety are served by the
		same end then, aye, I do.

				VICTORIA
		I cannot believe you are saying this? 
		You, who I have relied on all this
		time --

				BROWN
			(cutting in)
		Have I ever let you down before--?

				VICTORIA
			(as if he had not spoken)
		-- You stand there and tell me it is
		my duty ... after all you promised me!

				BROWN
		I'm breaking no promises!

				VICTORIA
		You are forcing me to do the very
		thing you know I fear most!

				BROWN
		For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying
		to keep you safe!

				VICTORIA
		I will not hear any more about my
		safety!!  You made me a promise and
		now you have broken it!

	BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.

				BROWN
		-- When I took you out riding, come
		rain or shine, because I knew it was
		right for you, when I kept the bairns
		off your back so you could have a bit
		of peace, when I saw you safe from
		home to home and you didn't even know
		I was there...!  All I've ever thought
		about is you!

				VICTORIA
		Then why send me back to them?!

				BROWN
		Because I have to!
			(pause
		Will you no listen to me, woman?

	Face turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.

				VICTORIA
		Do not presume to talk to your Queen
		in that manner.

	A long silence.  BROWN watches her, but she will not look
	at him again.  Finally, she walks very slowly across the
	room.  She turns in the doorway, her voice faltering
	slightly.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell.  I shall
		retire to my chamber.  Please attend
		me presently.

	As the door slams, we ...

						FADE TO BLACK.

	CAPTION: "NOVEMBER"

						FADE IN:

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, DINING ROOM - DAY

	A few weeks later.

	Close on a door as it opens.  The ROYAL FAMILY are eating
	lunch with members of the UPPER HOUSEHOLD.  VICTORIA walks
	in with LADY ELY.

	A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks
	and stands.  Clearly, they were not expecting her.  In
	silence, VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head
	of the table.

	At last, PONSONBY leans forward deferentially.

				PONSONBY
		May I say, how glad I am to see Your
		Majesty so much recovered.

	VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. 
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. 
	VICTORIA frowns.

				VICTORIA
		Where is my son?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Why is he not here?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		He is sick, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Then why are you not with him?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		You ordered all members of the Royal
		Family to attend you at Balmoral.

				VICTORIA
		What is the matter with him?

				PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
		He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

	VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.

				VICTORIA
		No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert,
		my husband, had typhoid fever.  I
		asked what was wrong with my son.

				JENNER
		The same, your Majesty.

	VICTORIA stops.  She stares down the length of the table. 
	A long pause.

				VICTORIA
		Why was I not informed?

				JENNER
		I did not consider it wise, in the
		circumstances, to tax your nerves.

				VICTORIA
		How ill is he?

	No answer.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
			(to Alexandra)
		Alex?

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		He is not well, ma'am.

	A beat.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I must go to him.

	Suddenly, VICTORIA stands.  Chairs bang back as everyone
	leaps to their feet.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		We must leave at once.

	Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts
	into activity.

	INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the
	servants and Householders hurrying about in every
	direction.

	EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

	Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage
	amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders
	rushing to be ready in time.

	Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles
	out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time 
	- yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and
	take her place.  She ignores him completely.

	BROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother
	ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a
	second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's
	obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. 
	BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races
	away under him.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	Some days later.  A tableau.

	QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch
	surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY.  They watch DOCTOR JENNER
	bend to examine the ghostly figure of BERTIE.  He listens
	for a pulse.  Finally, he looks up.

				JENNER
		Better.

	VICTORIA lets out a deep breath.  She takes hold of
	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.

				VICTORIA
		Should the good Lord see fit to spare
		my son, I will order a mass to be
		celebrated at St. George's.  The
		people must share with their Queen,
		her prayers and hopes for their future
		King.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY

	A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the
	door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him
	with PONSONBY at her side.

				PONSONBY
			(aside to BROWN)
		The Queen will be riding to St.
		George's on the fifth.

				BROWN
			(launching straight in)
		I recommend Her Majesty uses the
		covered carriage with a full Horse
		Guard.  In the event of any
		disturbance I will ensure --

				VICTORIA
			(cutting in)
		I will ride to St. George's in an open
		carriage.  It is time the Queen was
		seen by her public.

	VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed
	by PONSONBY.  We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and
	closer until ...

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

	Some weeks later.

	A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of
	onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding
	the cathedral.  All the time, his eyes flick left and
	right, searching the faces in front of him for potential
	assassins.  Over his intense watchfulness we hear ...

				DEAN WELLSELLY (O.S.)
		... praise and magnify thy glorious
		name for that thou has raised thy
		servant Albert Edward, Prince of Wales
		from the bed of sickness. 
		We pray thee to perfect the recovery
		of thy servant and to crown him day by
		day with more abundant blessings both
		for body and soul, through Jesus
		Christ our Lord ...

	The CONGREGATION mutters a vast ...

				CONGREGATION (O.S.)
		Amen.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

	VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down
	the steps towards the cheering crowd.  As DEAN WELLSELLY
	and BROWN follow, BROWN sees ARTHUR O'CONNER break from the
	onlookers, pulling out a gun.  BROWN yells out:

				BROWN
		NO!!

	He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to
	the ground and twists the gun out of his hand.  As they
	fall we hear laughter and:

				BERTIE (O.S.)
		So there he is, Arthur O'Conner...

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, DINING HALL - NIGHT

	It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private
	dinner party.  They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS
	ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY.  BROWN is in
	attendance.  He stands off to one side, near the door.

				BERTIE
			(bristling with confidence)
		... all seven stone of the man,
		paddling madly towards us through a
		sea of Horse Guards, waving something
		that looks vaguely like a pen.  I
		thought he must be one of the mother's
		ardent readership in search of the
		Royal indenture...

	More chortling.  VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly. 
	BROWN looks straight ahead.

				BERTIE (CONT'D)
		I believe I saw him first and then
		alerted Brown.  I'm not convinced that
		he wasn't taking a snooze on top of
		the box.  Anyway, we had our man
		pinned down and I must say, Brown
		acquitted himself admirably.  Of
		course the gun was a fake, but all the
		same, it was well done.

	No-one registers BROWN.  But while VICTORIA does not look
	at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.

				VICTORIA
		I intend Brown to be rewarded with a
		special medal cast in gold.  It will
		be called The Devoted Service Medal.

	The guests applaud politely.  BERTIE clinks his glass for
	attention and raises it high.

				BERTIE
		A toast.  Victoria Regina!

	The others raise their glasses in unison.

				EVERYONE
		Victoria Regina!

	VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN remains alone by the door.

				DISRAELI (O.S.)
		The people of England have expressed
		in a manner which cannot be mistaken,
		that they will uphold the ancient
		monarchy of England ...

	INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

	DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of
	Tory delegates.

				DISRAELI
		... If the first great object of the

						FADE IN:

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The sound of rain driven hard against a window.  We creep
	slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty
	year-old BROWN.  With his whiskey for company, he is
	sitting at his desk, writing in the diary.

	The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but
	there remain a few blank pages.  Slowly, he fills them in.

				BROWN (V.O.)
		We should not live in expectation of
		contentment.  Fifteen years of
		vigilance will not guarantee peace of
		mind.  Yesterday, intruders were again
		reported in the South Wing.  I believe
		my prompt arrival may have averted any
		crisis, but it was a timely reminder. 
		It is a great comfort to me that my
		efforts in securing the Queen's safety
		over the years have not been in vain. 
		Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word
		that she's dissatisfied.  And I feel
		sure that if she were unhappy she
		would have found the occasion  to
		speak to me in person, as she has so
		often done in the past.

	A knock at the door.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		What is it?

	We hear a young PAGE, breathless from running.

				PAGE
		North woods, sir.

	BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.

	EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

	BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm.  He
	walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his
	hair and clothes.

	Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm.

	A coin flips through the air to be caught by an
	outstretched hand.  The second GUARD grins.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT

	BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	And now we are back with the opening sequence.  Truncated,
	severe, and shot from a slightly different angle.  The
	driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack
	to his left, he spins and plunges on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for
	air.  He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
	length.

	EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

	He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.

	Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly
	swaying trees.  A branch snaps behind him.  He spins round,
	bellows deep from his heart:

				BROWN
		God save the Queen!!

	And fires.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	A few days later.

	VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY
	ELY.  They arrive at a door.  VICTORIA stands facing it.

				VICTORIA
			(quietly)
		How long has he been this sick?

				LADY ELY
		A few days, ma'am.

				VICTORIA
		Why was I not told earlier?

	LADY ELY doesn't answer.  VICTORIA knows anyway.  She nods. 
	LADY ELY knocks.  The door is opened by a young UNDER
	SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here
	in the servant's quarters.  VICTORIA walks in.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of
	the life here shocks her deeply.  The cheap furniture, the
	anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.

	He is lying in bed, barely conscious.  After a moment, he
	opens his eyes and stares at her.  She steps forward,
	smiling nervously.

	Her voice is the old voice, between friends.

				VICTORIA
		You should never have gone out in such
		foul weather.

				BROWN
		Someone has to look after you.
			(pause)
		It could've been someone.  It was
		before.

				VICTORIA
		Yes.  Yes it was.

	He cannot speak.  It's difficult for her too, but she
	speaks for him.

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		My Ministers are as impertinent as
		ever.  Dispatches are now so numerous,
		they come in a trunk.  Sometimes I do
		believe they will never stop.  Endless
		letters...
		 

	Her voice falters.  A pause

				VICTORIA (CONT'D)
		I know I have not always been the
		loyal friend you deserved, John.  And
		yet here I am now, even now, feeling
		desperate at the thought of losing
		you.

	She starts to cry.

				BROWN
		Don't be silly, woman.

	His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
	herself together.  Seeing a bowl of water on the side
	table, she steps across.  Carefully folding a cloth in
	four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. 
	Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN
	gestures protectively.

				BROWN (CONT'D)
		Not too near.

	INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

	A week later.  PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window
	overlooking the grounds.

				JENNER
		Erysipelas.

				PONSONBY
		Not too protracted, I hope.

				JENNER
			(shakes his head)
		A few days...
			(beat)
		When he heard, the Prince of Wales
		threw the bust from the window of the
		Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to
		gather the fragments.

	A beat.

				PONSONBY
		The Queen wishes to publish an account
		of him.

				JENNER
		Dear oh dear.

				PONSONBY
		We think she can be dissuaded.
			(beat)
		Have you had a glance at the diary?

				JENNER
		Yes.

				PONSONBY
		Quite.
			(beat)
		I think I'd best take it back.

				JENNER
		Of course.

	He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it
	over to PONSONBY.  The two men move away from the window,
	to go their separate ways.  Daily business beckons.

				JENNER (CONT'D)
		Where did you find it by the way?

				PONSONBY
		Some young page was boasting about
		having seen it.
			(beat)
		Lucky.

	JENNER nods.

				JENNER
		Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.

				PONSONBY
		No, indeed.

	The two men head off in opposite directions down the
	corridor.

EXT.  NIGHT - HOLLYWOOD HILLS, LOS ANGELES
    
Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit. The words on the sign
read... "Mulholland Drive." The car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. NIGHT - MULHOLLAND DRIVE
    
Gliding we follow the car - an older black Cadillac limousine
- as it winds its way up Mulholland Drive through the
darkness of the Hollywood Hills. There is no one else on the
road. As we drift closer to the car...
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
    
Two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat. A
beautiful, younger, dark-haired woman sits in back. She sits
close up against the door and stares out into the darkness.
She seems to be thinking about something. Suddenly she turns
and looks ahead. The car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		What are you doing? You don't stop
		here ...
    
The car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind
curve. Both men turn to the woman.
    
				DRIVER
		Get out of the car.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT.  FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
    
Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
    

    
The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. EXT. - CADILLAC LIMOUSINE
    
The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets
up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below. She clumsily starts down toward it.
   
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
Franklin Avenue. A car races by and its headlights flare on
her face. Her expression shows fear and panic. She doesn't
know where she is or where to go. She runs frantically across
the street. She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard. Coming up Sunset in the
distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going.
She hurries into the darkness of another residential area. A
car turns onto the street and comes toward her. She
instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes.
  
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
    
As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street. A drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her. She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building. The couple passes by without
noticing her. Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.
   
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE   - NIGHT
    
Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives,
HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40's to 50), stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They
do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a
long moment.
  
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		You feel it?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah.
    
They continue to stare.
    
 
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along
		the shoulder ... man up the road said he
		saw two cars drag racin'...then you got
		that blind corner.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		The boys found this on the floor in back
		of the Caddy.
    
Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Yeah, they showed me
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Could be unrelated.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Could be...any of those dead kids wearin'
		pearl earrings?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		That's what I'm thinkin'.
    
Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
He looks out and wonders.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - EARLY DAWN
    
The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open. The cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate. The woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building. She sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage.

    
They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat. Their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN
    
The woman comes into a living room where a single trunk
remains. She goes further into the apartment and crouches
down in a back corner of the kitchen. She listens as
footsteps come across the courtyard. She hears the red-headed
woman and the cab driver get the trunk. She hears them set it
down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-
headed woman walks right past her, grabs a set of keys off
the kitchen counter, then leaves the apartment. The woman can
hear the door being locked. She lets go, slides to the
kitchen floor, and passes out.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT , HOLLYWOOD - MORNING
    
Two well-dressed men HERB and DAN (mid 30's) are sitting at a
table drinking coffee. Herb has finished eating his
breakfast, but Dan hasn't touched his bacon and eggs - he
appears too nervous to eat. A blonde waitress with a
nameplate saying "DIANE" lays the check on their table
smiles, then walks off.
    
				HERB
		Why did you want to go to breakfast if
		you're not hungry?

				DAN
		I just wanted to come here.

				HERB
		To Denny's? I wasn't going to say
		anything, but why Denny's?
    
				DAN
		This Denny's.
    
				HERB
		Okay. Why this Denny's?
    
    
				DAN
		It's kind of embarrassing but,
    
				HERB
		Go ahead.
    
				DAN
		I had a dream about this place.
    
				HERB
		Oh boy.
    
				DAN
		You see what I mean...
    
				HERB
		Okay, so you had a dream about this
		place. Tell me.
    
				DAN
		Well ... it's the second one I've had, but
		they were both the same......they start
		out that I'm in here but it's not day or
		night. It's kinda half night, but it
		looks just like this except for the
		light, but I'm scared like I can't tell
		ya. Of all people you're standing right
		over there by that counter. You're in
		both dreams and you're scared. I get
		even more frightened when I see how
		afraid you are and then I realize what it
		is - there's a man...in back of this
		place. He's the one ... he's the one
		that's doing it. I can see him through
		the wall. I can see his face and I hope
		I never see that face ever outside a
		dream.
    
Herb stares at Dan to see if he will continue. Dan looks
around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.
    
				DAN (cont'd)
		That's it.
    
				HERB
		So, you came to see if he's out there?

				DAN
		To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
    
				HERB
		Right then.

    
Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to
pay. Dan just sits.
    
As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.
Herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with
the cashier. He motions for Dan to follow him. Dan rises
reluctantly and he and Herb make their way outside.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. DENNY'S
    
Now Herb waits for Dan to lead the way.
    
				DAN
		Around here.
    
Dan takes Herb across the front of Denny's to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back.
    
They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone. Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.
    
CLOSER ON DAN
    
Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
    
The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
    
Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
    
Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
    
Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.
    
				HERB
		Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!
    
He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse
in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.
    

    
				HERB (cont'd)
		My God!

A blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us. As the
blonde's face fills the screen we move with her and stay with
her as she goes. Her face is bright and her eyes move here
and there taking in everything. She can hardly believe she's
in Los Angeles - the City of Dreams. She and the old woman
pass under a sign which reads "WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES."
The girl smiles and looks around excited by every detail.

The girl and the old lady exit the terminal with their bags.
An older gentleman has joined the old lady. They stop at the
taxicab stand. The old lady takes the blonde girl's hand.
    
				OLD LADY
		It's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's
		been so nice travelling with you.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and

		Now, remember I'll be watching for you on

		Okay Irene. Won't that be the day.

				IRENE
		The best of luck to you, Betty. Take

				BETTY
		Okay I will. Thanks again.
    
Betty and Irene give each other a hug. The old gentleman nods
to Betty and takes Irene off. Betty smiles after them.
Suddenly someone is grabbing her bags. She turns abruptly to
find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. She turns
once more and waves at Irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.
    
				CAB DRIVER
		Where to?
    
				BETTY

Betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. Each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega,
Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire
Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn
right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst
and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.

EXT. 1612 HAVENHURST
    
The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell.

    
An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
    
				MANAGER
		Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.

				BETTY
		I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois
		isn't it?
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		In all my living glory, baby.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		You can call me Coco ... everybody does.
		Stay there, I'll get the key.
    
				BETTY
		Okay, Coco.
    
Coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. She starts off into the
courtyard and Betty picks up her bags and follows. As Coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
    
				COCO
		I guess it was your grandfather, was
		it ... he called me to check in, said you
		were on your way and for you to call when
		you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
    
				BETTY
		Yes, he is. He raises corn.
    
				COCO
		Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood

				BETTY
		Well, I ...
    
				COCO
		You don't have to tell me. It's written

		You probably don't remember her, but
		Louise Bonner lives right over there in

				BETTY
		Have many famous actors and actresses
		lived here? I was meaning to ask you
		that.
    
				COCO
		Honey, all the great ones came through
		here at one time or another.
    
A haunting music begins to swell.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
    
		People say in the springtime when the
		wind blows the smell of the jasmine you
		can still feel the presence of everyone

				BETTY
		I guess I've come to quite a place.
    
				COCO
		Sweetheart, you don't know the half of
		it.
    
The music fades.
    
Coco looks down suddenly. On the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
    
				COCO (cont'd)

		WILKINS! ... (no answer) ... THAT DOG CRAPS

		You don't have pets do you?

    
				BETTY
		No, I don't.
    
				COCO
		That's good. They're allowed, but I

The dirty and torn black cocktail dress of the dark-haired

where the dark-haired woman can be seen showering through
rippled glass. There's the sound of a door opening. We see a

We can hear the dark-haired woman's frightened breathing as

Betty enters, thrilled with what she sees. The apartment is

		Wow!

		Everybody in this building's pretty much

		If you want, later I'll introduce you

				BETTY
		Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

				COCO
		You got it! See you later honey.
    
Coco leaves and closes the door behind her. Betty begins to
explore the apartment.- After walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. She moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. She goes into the
bedroom. She smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. She notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. She
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling
tiles. As she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in
the mirror above it. Suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. There before her is the naked,
beautiful dark-haired woman.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my!
    
She quickly closes the shower door.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I'm sorry. My Aunt ... Ruth didn't tell
		me someone was going to be here. I'm so
		sorry.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		That's okay.
    
				BETTY
		I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm
		sure she told you I was coming.
    
There's a silence.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		There was an accident. I came here.

				BETTY
		I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm
		sorry.   Are you all right?

    
There is another silence.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What happened?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		A car ... a car accident.
    
				BETTY
		Are you okay?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		I think so. I was just taking a shower.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get
		back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
    
Betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she
stops and looks back in.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What's your name?
    
We see a close-up of the dark-haired woman. We see her eyes
widen with a kind of fear. She's frantically thinking -
searching her mind for an answer.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I'm sorry. I'll get out of here and we
		can talk later.

The bathroom door opens and the dark-haired woman comes out
wrapped in a towel. She's drying her hair with another. She
and Betty stare at one another.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		My name is Rita.
    
				BETTY
		Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
    
				RITA
		No ..........I.

				BETTY
		I...I mean......I...it's none of my
		business.

				RITA
		She has pretty red hair... she is very
		kind I think.
    
				BETTY
		She sure is. She's letting me stay here
		while she's working on a movie that's
		being made in Canada, but I guess you
		know that.  I couldn't afford a place
		like this in a million years. Unless of
		course I'm discovered and become a movie
		star. Of course, I'd rather be known as
		a great actress than a movie star, but
		sometimes people end up being both and
		that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I
		came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so
		excited to be here..I mean I just came
		here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream
		place. You can imagine how I feel.
    
				RITA
		I think I've been hurt.
    
				BETTY
		Oh...
    
Betty goes to Rita.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Sit down...
    
Betty sits Rita on the bed. She leans down and looks at her
head and face.
    
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Where were you hurt?
    
Rita motions to her head above her forehead. Betty looks
through her hair and finds her wound which has stopped
bleeding but is surrounded by a very large blue black
bruising.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		We should get a doctor.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
				BETTY
		But, this could be serious.

				RITA
		No...I need to sleep.
    
				BETTY
		If you have a concussion you shouldn't
		sleep.
    
				RITA
		It will be okay if I sleep. I need to
		lie down and sleep.

				BETTY
		All right, but...I'm going to check on
		you.
    
Rita lies down and is instantly asleep. Betty leans over her
and listens to her breathing. She gets a blanket and drapes
it over the beautiful sleeping Rita, then leaves the room.

EXT. - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
The street level of the office building is filthy and houses
stores selling racks of cheap toys. Up above we see office
windows and a big sign saying "Office Space For Rent" along
with a telephone number to call. We drift in toward one of
the windows on the sixth floor.
    
							CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE ON SIXTH FLOOR
    
Two men are in the room, JOE and ED. Joe leans up against a
rack of filing cabinets. He is in his late twenties. He
looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker - wears a blue
denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
    
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.
    
				JOE
		So man, that's unheard of ... an accident
		like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
    
				ED
		Unreal ... so, you're looking good.
		Whatcha doin' these days?
    
				JOE
		Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff
		for this guy.
    
				ED
		Making ends meet, huh.
    
				JOE
		Hardly.
    
				ED
		Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
    
				JOE
		Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope
		you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
    
				ED
		It was just a thing. The story made you
		laugh.
    
				JOE
		Yeah, that's a funny story.
    
Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the
desk - to a small worn black book.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		So, there it is ... Ed's famous black book.

    
				ED
		Yeah, the history of the world in phone
		numbers.
    
Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view
holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
scream.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh...man!
    
With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		Hey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
		and use the phone. Help me out. You
		gotta call the hospital.
    
The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
seeing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		I mean it! Get down here quick! She's
		hurt and I can't do everything myself,
		man.

    
Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		No, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
    
He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh ... man!
    
Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.
    
				VOICES
		What the hell .... what happened? What's
		this cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
		It's the vacuum what did it.
    
Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CENTURY CITY BUILDING - DAY
    
We see three men sitting at a conference table RAYMOND(RAY)
HOTT -president of production, wearing a crisp blue
suit,VINCENT DARBY -senior vice-president, wearing a crisp
green suit and ROBERT SMITH -talent manager, wearing a crisp
brown suit. Ray and Mr. Darby sit at the head of the table
and Robert Smith sits along the side. A younger man -ADAM
KESHER enters and sits down, with an arrogant nonchalance,
next to Robert Smith. Adam is dressed in a frumpy old
fashioned plaid shirt, worn jacket, dark blue cotton slacks,
and a pair of old brown wing tips. As he sits he is holding
and twirling a vintage "7-iron" golf club.
    
				ADAM
		So what's the problem?
    
				RAY
		There is no problem.
    
				ADAM
		So why did you idiots bring me
		here? ... I'm in the middle of making a
		picture.
    
Silence for a moment. A man enters through a rear door and
whispers something to Mr. Darby and shows him something on a
piece of paper. Mr. Darby studies the piece of paper.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(to man who entered)
		What was it last time?
    
The man who entered points to something on the paper.
    
				MR. DARBY (cont'd)
		Okay, let's try the next one.
    
The man nods and leaves.

		He isn't gonna like it.

		We'll see.
    
				ADAM
		Hello ... who're we talkin' about here?
    
Robert Smith shuffles nervously in his chair next to Adam.

    
				ROBERT SMITH
		You see Adam... there are some suggestions
		which are to be brought forward ... and I
		know you said you would entertain
		suggestions and that's all anybody here
		is asking you to do.

		What're you talking about?

conference room.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
    
The men in dark suits go in as if they owned the place. Ray,
Mr. Darby and Robert Smith stand immediately. Adam remains
seated. Mr. Darby is the only one near enough to attempt a
hand shake, but when he offers his hand it is not taken. The
men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and
without acknowledging anyone. One of the men in a dark suit
opens a briefcase. Ray has been trying to make
introductions.
    
				RAY
		Ah... the Castigliane brothers. Let me
		introduce you around ... please ... sit down.
		(after they've already seated
		themselves) ... this is Mr. Darby whom you
		know and this is the director Adam
		Kesher and his manager Robert Smith
    
The Castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this,
however, during the introductions the one with the briefcase
removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of Ray.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Ah... she's very pretty.
    
We see the photo of the girl - of a nice looking blonde -
someone we've never seen before. Adam looks like he doesn't
know what's going on and he's getting upset about not
knowing. His manager, Robert Smith, is beginning to see the
makings of a confrontation - he's starting to panic.
    
				MR. DARBY
			(referring to Castigliane
			brothers)
		May I offer you gentlemen anything?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Espresso.

				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Nothing. 
    
				ADAM
		Uh  what's the photo for?
    
				MR. DARBY
			(picking up phone and speaking)
		One espresso ... no, that's it.
			(sets phone down - addresses
			Castigliane brothers)
		I think you're going to enjoy your
		espresso this time... I've been doing
		quite a bit of research knowing how hard
		you are to please... this one comes highly
		recommended.
    
				ADAM
		What's the photo for?
    
				RAY
			(to Adam)
		A recommendation... a recommendation to
		you Adam.
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		Not a recommendation.
    
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		What girl? For what? What is this Ray?
    
Ray, still standing with a forced smile, turns to the
Castigliane brothers.
    
				RAY
		We'd be happy to put her in the pile for
		considerations ... you'd be pleased to know
		there's quite a lot of interest in this
		role.
    
				ADAM
		Interest?! There's six of the top
		actresses that want this thing.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		This is the girl.
    
				ADAM
		Ray...you better take care of this.
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		Hold on ... hold on, Adam.
    
				ADAM
		Hold on!!!!!!!! There's no way, there's
		no way!!!
    
Luigi Castigliane's espresso is brought in by the man who had
been in earlier. The man sets the espresso down in front of
Luigi and takes a step back. The room becomes silent -
watching the Espresso Man and Luigi. Without looking up Luigi
speaks softly.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
			(leading forward to hear)
		Pardon?
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Napkin.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN
		Of course. Excuse me.
    
The Espresso Man leaves the room. Luigi looks at the
espresso. Vincenzo stares at Adam.
    
Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo. The Espresso
man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the
espresso.
    
				ESPRESSO MAN (cont'd)
		Will that be all, Sir?
    
Luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very
still waiting, the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room.
    
Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the
espresso cup. He looks around at Ray and Mr. Darby - seeing
them stare at the espresso cup.
    
Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam.
    
Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand.
With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it
above the napkin. He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth.
He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso
to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in
that position for a moment.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Is shit!
    
Luigi Castigliane stands up.
    
				RAY
		I'm sorry. That was a highly
		recommended...
    
				MR. DARBY
		That's considered one of the finest
		espressos in the world , Sir.
    
Luigi just stands there. A small thread on his left suit
jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back
into the fabric. Vincenzo closes his briefcase, takes out a
hankerchief and cleans his nose - then stands, placing the
handkerchief back in his pocket.
    
				ADAM
		Wait a minute!! What's going on here?
    
Vincenzo just stares toward Adam as if he's not even there.
    
				ADAM
		There's no way that girl is in my movie!
    
Silence.

    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		That is the girl.
    
The Castigliane brothers begin to leave. Adam stands up
trembling with anger.
    
				ADAM
		Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		It is no longer your film.
    
Adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in. The
Castigliane brothers leave. As the big blonde wood doors
close behind them Adam starts to boil.
    
				ADAM
			(screaming)
		You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
    
				RAY
		I'll speak to someone.
    
				ADAM
			(turning to his manager)
		And you'd better speak to someone
		too ... or find yourself another client!!
		This smells like a set-up to me!
			(back to Ray)
		And by the way, Ray, I don't know who
		these guys are kidding, but every foot of
		film I've shot is in a vault at the lab
		that only I can access. No one's getting
		that film!!
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		This is a catastrophe...
			(turning toward Ray)
		you told me they might insist on a girl,
		that's all.
    
				ADAM
		Why didn't you tell me, Robert? That's
		what I mean ... you set me up! I woulda
		never come here.
			(standing)
		I'm leaving. I'm a director you don't
		want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!
    
Adam storms out of the room.

Adam exits the building carrying his 7-iron. An attendant
takes his valet parking ticket. While Adam, still fuming,
waits for his car he notices the big limo standing off to one
side. He stares at the car and the huge limo driver leaning
up against the front driver's side door.
    
Adam's car arrives - a late model Porsche. Before Adam gets
into his car he addresses the attendant.
    
				ADAM
		Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
		that limo?
    
				ATTENDANT
		They two guys in dark suits?
    
Adam nods and walks over to the limo. The limo driver eyes

		Castigliane brothers?
    
				LIMO DRIVER
		Beat it!
    
				ADAM
		O.K.
    
Adam raises his 7-iron and smashes out the limo's windshield.
He whacks two big dents in the hood, then smashes out a
headlight. The limo driver starts towards him. Adam laughs,

Betty is stretched out on the big leather couch in the living

coffee table next to her. She is talking on the phone.

    
				BETTY
		No Grandpa, you wouldn't believe it.
		It's more beautiful than I ever
		dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food.
		The refrigerator's full ... Aunt Ruthie
		said she'd call me when she got
		settled... it was real smooth. I sat next
		to a lady who gave up her first class
		seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was
		so nice to me. She invited me to her

		to be careful, but I sure love it here
		Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get
		here ... yeah, it's long distance. I love

		kiss for me. Okay, I love you
		Grandpa ... bye.
    
Betty hangs up the phone, takes a big bite of her sandwich
and lays flat out on the couch, chewing and smiling up at the

Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
    
Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee.
The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. The phone inside rings. Betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. She crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.

		Hello ... Aunt Ruth!! I can't tell you how

		Yes, either right here on this fabulous

		Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't

		No, please don't worry... thank you so

Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. She sits for a
moment listening. Silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. As she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. Rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. Betty goes into the bedroom. Rita looks up
at her with desperation.

		I ... yes, but ... I ...

    
				BETTY
		Open it!
    
Rita slowly unzips the purse. The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
    
Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.
    
Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of horror.
(note: This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)

INTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
Ray crosses a carpeted closed area. He mounts a flight of
stairs. At the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. Ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. At the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. Again Ray punches in a code. The elevator opens and
Ray goes in. The elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. Ray waits. Finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
		Who is it please?
    
				RAY
		Raymond Harris ... 20743.
    
The elevator begins to move up. When it stops, the door opens
and Ray walks into a windowless reception area where a
beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
			(very quietly)
		You may go right in, Ray.
    
Ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. The
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. Heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
    
    
Ray enters and the doors close behind him. Ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
    
				RAY
		Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced
		Rowk).
    
Mr. Roque stares at Ray silently.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Do you want him replaced?
    
Mr. Roque continues to stare.
    
				RAY
		I know they said...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Then?
    
				RAY
		Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but
		that means we should ...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
				RAY
		Shut everything down ... Is that something
		that...do you want us to shut everything
		down?
    
Silence. Ray doesn't know what to do. He struggles to
interpret Mr. Roque's silence. He waits. Mr. Roque does
nothing but stare.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Then we'll shut everything down.
    
Silence.
    
Ray turns. The doors open as he approaches them and he
leaves the room. The doors close.

Vincenzo and Luigi are staring silently and without
expression at the broken windshield of the limousine. The
limousine driver suddenly starts signaling to a car entering
the driveway to the building. He turns to the Castigliane
brothers.
    
				LIMO DRIVER
		The other car is here sirs. Please allow

The limo driver opens the rear door of the new limo, then
hurries around and opens the other rear door. The new driver
gets out of the car.

are standing waiting for their chili dogs with a girl, LANEY,
who could be very good looking but she seems to be in poor
health. Her hair is long and stringy. She's wearing a
tight, short sleeve blue sweater, black jeans and boots.
    
				BILLY
		Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

				JOE
		No, no, no, I told you. They're fine.
		They're all real happy.

		Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.

		Yeah, what for?

		Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's

The chili dogs arrive and they pay for them.

		Nothing... I don't like being out in the

				JOE
		It must be just so pathetic being you.
		Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in

The three make their way to the van. Joe looks over at
Laney.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		You sure you don't want anything?
    
				LANEY
			(hesitantly)
		Not here...no thanks.
    
				JOE
		Not a coke or anything?
    
				LANEY
		No ... thanks though... I'll take a

		Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
    
As Laney is getting her cigarette and lighting it..

men dressed in suits and wearing dark glasses are driving
slowly. As they go each man is scanning sidewalks,
buildings, passing cars as if hunting for someone. They pass
by us and as we turn we leave them and pick-up Adam driving
in the opposite direction in the other lane. We stay with
Adam.

He can hear Lorraine calling his name. She seems to be
coming closer. He sets the jewelry case and the paint can on
the floor, kneels down and opens the paint can with his car
key. Just as Lorraine enters the kitchen, he opens the
jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of Hot Pink
paint into her jewelry case.

He puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them

Lorraine grabs hold of him. Starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. She tears his jacket. Adam stands all at
once and with his wet Hot Pink hands he pushes Lorraine and
slams her into the kitchen counter just as Gene the poolman
enters. Gene grabs ahold of Adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into Adam's face.
    
				GENE
		That's not a way to treat your wife,

Adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries

Diane searches through her many checks to find Betty and
Rita's.
    
The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue
dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the
manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her
eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes
out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's
check as she places it on their table. She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty
noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the
woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then
leaving.

    
The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her
pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the
manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she
goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense
and lost in a thought.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(without moving a muscle)
		Shhhh.
    
At that moment Diane the waitress reappears at their table.
Diane looks Betty in the eye and while looking at Betty her
left hand slides the Mont Blanc out from under the check and
back into her pocket.
    
				DIANE
		Thank you. Come in again.
    
Betty holds her gaze.
    
				BETTY
		You're welcome. We will.
    
Relieved Diane leaves and goes about her business. Betty
looks over at Rita waiting for her to tell her something.
Rita slowly turns and focuses on Betty.
    
				RITA
		I remember something... I remember
		something!

Betty and Rita are walking back to the apartment. We see
them from a distance. They are talking and gesturing in an
excited and animated way. Just after they enter through the
iron gates of 1612 Havenhurst and are out of sight we notice
a car moving slowly up Havenhurst toward us. We notice two
men in the front seat who seem to be looking around for
something.

AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
    
Betty and Rita are sitting next to each other on the leather
couch. Betty is rifling through the phone book. She finds
the listings for Selwyn. Her finger drifts down and finds D.
Selwyn followed by an address and phone number. It is the
only Selwyn with a D. first name. She hands the phone to
Rita.
    
				BETTY
		Strange to be calling yourself.
    
				RITA
		Maybe it's not me.
    
				BETTY
		Call the number.
    
Betty reads the number off and Rita pushes the corresponding
buttons. Each tone seems to be louder than the last. The
ringing seems deafening. There's a click and the phone is
answered - by a machine. A woman's voice is heard - loudly.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(coming from answering machine)
		Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message.
    
Betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also -
straining to hear everything. The machine starts recording.
Betty hangs up the phone immediately.
    
				RITA
		It's not my voice ... but I know her.
    
				BETTY
		Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn.

TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking
down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front
door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back.
    
Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers.
Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is
on her face and clothes.
    
				KENNY
		Adam Kesher...he...
    
				LORRAINE
		Yeah, right ... get lost!
    
She slams the door, but Kenny's foot stops it and pushes it
back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open
once again. Kenny enters the house.
    
				KENNY
		This is Adam Kesher's house. Where...
    
				LORRAINE
		Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!!
    
Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with
pink paint.
    
				GENE
		I guess you don't understand English.
		She asked to leave. Here's the door.
    
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door.
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.

    
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -
spilling out onto the kitchen floor. Finishing his work with
the vintage golf clubs - Kenny leaves.

Adam, in his Porsche, makes his way up the canyon.
    
INT. PORSCHE
    
Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon
road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area
gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a
dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in
a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No
one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling
stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from
the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the
brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light
is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled
unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red
embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string
tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The
Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front
of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.
    
				COWBOY
		Howdy!
    
				ADAM
		Howdy to you.

		Beautiful night.

		Yeah.
    
				COWBOY
		Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the
		way up to see me from that Beverly Hills
		Hotel.

				ADAM
		No problem. What's on your mind?
    
				COWBOY
		Well now, here's a man who wants to get
		right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it
		are ya?
    
				ADAM
		Whatever.
    
				COWBOY
		A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes
		some ways toward how a man's life will
		be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
    
				ADAM
		Sure.
    
				COWBOY
		Now... did you answer cause you thought
		that's what I wanted to hear or did you
		think about what I said and answer cause
		you truly believe that to be right?
    
				ADAM
		I agree with what you said...truly.
    
				COWBOY
		What did I say?
    
				ADAM
		That a man's attitude determines to a
		large extent how his life will be.
    
				COWBOY
		So since you agree I guess you could be a
		person who does not care about the good
		life.
    
				ADAM
		How's that?

    
				COWBOY
		Well, just stop for a little second and
		think about it. Will ya do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Okay, I'm thinking.
    
				COWBOY
		No. You're too busy being a smart aleck
		to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think
		and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya
		do that for me?
    
				ADAM
		Look ... where's this going? What do you
		want me to do?
    
				COWBOY
		There's sometimes a buggy. How many
		drivers does a buggy have?
    
				ADAM
		One.
    
				COWBOY
		So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy
		and you fix your attitude and you can
		ride along with me.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
				COWBOY
		Now I know a few things. I know you have
		had a rough day. You're probably thinkin'
		I don't know the half of it, but in
		actual fact I know every part of it. The
		business of gittin' thrown off your
		movie, the heartache of seeing your wife
		with another man... losin' access to that
		precious film vault...
    
Adam suddenly looks stunned, unsure.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		... realizin' you don't have hardly a
		nickel to your name and then add on to
		that the sickenin' feeling some men are
		gonna catch you and hurt you bad for
		bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like
		that. They are rough, but what will
		tomorrow bring? Will it be better than
		today? The same ... or worse?
		A lot of that is up to us individually.
		Up to us and our attitude. When the
		Castigliane brothers said "This is no
		longer your film," they meant it, but
		they didn't mean you were not going to
		direct it. I want you to go back to work
		tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
		actress anyway ... audition many girls for
		the part. When you see the girl that was
		shown to you earlier today, you will say
		" This is the girl." The rest of the
		cast can stay- that is up to you, but
		that lead girl is not up to you. Now,
		you will see me one more time if you do
		good. You will see me two more times if
		you do bad. Good night.
    
The Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness.
Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing, then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the
Cowboy.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		You thinkin' this'll work out, cause I
		was thinkin' it just might.
    
				ADAM
		It will work out.
    
				COWBOY
		Good then, but, just in case, that bank's
		gonna stay closed a bit longer. You
		understand that?
    
				ADAM
		I understand.
    
				COWBOY
		You're an understandin' fella.
    
				ADAM
		So, this is the last time I see you then
		unless I do bad?
    
				COWBOY
		No, this one doesn't count. It's part of
		the original one. So then ... until we meet
		again.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
Adam gets in his car and drives off leaving the Cowboy
smiling behind him.

			Betty's shoulder and squeezes
			it)
		If you need any help you know where to
		find me.
    
Betty puts her hand on Coco's shoulder and gives her a
squeeze.
    
				BETTY
		You're really something Coco...thank you.

				COCO
		Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise
		Bonner says there's trouble in there.
		You remember last night. Sometimes she's
		wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid
		of it.

    
Coco turns and walks away. Betty studies her and thinks
about what she said before turning and going back inside.

Detective Neal Domgaard throws two wallets down on the desk
in front of Detective Harry McKnight. Harry pauses in the
middle of a large bite of grilled cheese sandwich with bacon
and tomato. He looks down and studies the wallets.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
			(biting in and chewing)
		Nice wallets.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony
		credit cards ... off the two guys in the
		Caddy.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		The one of 'em still alive?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You
		remember Dr.Scott.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Oh yeah.

    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Well he said...  you know in his way... you
		know what I mean? Besides the guy
		gettin' rolled up under the kids car
		which busted him up pretty bad, there was
		this little knife-like torn piece of
		metal, you know, off the car body, rolled
		out and slid up through this guy's neck
		and just kinda slit his aorta, you know,
		but they didn't find it right away, so
		the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you
		know, to the brain - all this time cause
		it was just like this thin little
		puncture wound on the surface of his neck
		that kinda sealed itself, he said, while
		inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty
		steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's
		laughin' you know like he does 'cause he
		knows we want to talk to this guy. He's
		laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a
		bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was
		kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we
		were all laughin'...the nurse was
		laughin'. You know how he is.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Find out who they are?
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't
		match up anywhere.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
			(another big bite - chewing)
		Interesting.
    
				DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
		Yeah ... and they both use the same
		address.
    
				DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
		Where at?

Betty is coming out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. She calls
back in to Rita.
    
				BETTY
		I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.
		Don't drink all the coke.

		Good luck!

		When I get back I'll have the cab

				RITA
		Okay.
    
Betty closes the door and heads across the courtyard. She
knocks on Coco's door and in a moment Coco answers.
    
				BETTY
		Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
    
				COCO
		It's all right gorgeous. Something
		wrong?
    
				BETTY
		No, no. I'm on my way to my audition.
		Before I go I wanted to ask you if you
		could remember the man's name ... Aunt
		Ruthie's friend who helped put this
		together. It completely went out of my
		mind.
    
				COCO
		His name's Wally Brown .... great guy.
		Been in the business since forever.
    
				BETTY
		Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
    
				COCO
		Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give
		him a good performance and he'll be happy
		and I've got a feeling you'll do just

		Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.

		Get going. You don't want to be late.

She walks through the gate and as she goes is stopped by a
PARAMOUNT GUARD.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And where do we think we're going, Miss?
    
Betty stops and turns.
    
				BETTY
		To my audition.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And who are we auditioning for today?
    
				BETTY
		Wally Brown.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		And do we know which of the fifty-seven

		No, we don't.

		Well, now we've got to figure that out

				BETTY
		Yes, Sir.
    
				PARAMOUNT GUARD
		Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive

		Then we want to walk three blocks down

		Let's see if we have a pass for Betty

INT.   EXECUTIVE BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
    
Betty finishes climbing some stairs and crosses to the
receptionist. She hands over her pass. The receptionist
looks at it, hands it back to Betty and points down the hall
to her left.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Number 43, on the left.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you.
    
Betty walks down the long corridor past several offices. The
door to office 43 is open when she arrives and she enters a
large sitting room with a receptionist at a desk off to one
side.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		May I help you?

    
				BETTY
		My name is Betty Elms. I'm here to
		audition for... Mr. Brown
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		Good. Perfect timing. Have a seat and
		I'll get Mr. Brown.
    
The receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then
enters.
    
She closes the door behind her and Betty is alone in the
sitting room. She sits on a couch and looks at the old
movie posters covering all four walls.
    
In a moment the same door opens again and an elderly,
distinguished looking gentleman WALLY BROWN comes out
smiling. Betty stands up immediately.
    
				WALLY
		Betty Elms?
    
				BETTY
		Yes.
    
				WALLY
		I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear
		friend of mine so it's particularly nice
		to meet you.
    
				BETTY
		Very pleased to meet you.

				WALLY
		Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
    
As they walk into Wally's office...
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		I took the liberty of inviting an extra
		person to see your audition. She saw
		your resume picture and was very
		interested in meeting you.
    
Inside Wally's office several people rise out of chairs when
Wally enters with Betty.
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		Betty Elms this is Jack Taft, my
		assistant, Jimmy Katz who we've already
		cast for the part of "Chuck". He'll be
		doing the scene with you.
		This is Julie Chadwick and Bob Brooker,
		the director, and our surprise guest is
		Sarah James. We couldn't afford her to
		cast our picture, but as casting agents
		go she's the best.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.
    
She and Betty shake hands.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		This is Nicki, my assistant.
    
Nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to Betty.
    
				WALLY
		And this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who
		you met out front.
    
Betty nervously smiles to the room.
    
				BETTY
		Hi.
    
				WALLY
		Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like
		a water or a coffee before we begin?
    
Betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I'm fine.
    
				WALLY
		Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty
		why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play
		the scene. Is there anything you'd like
		to say Bob... something to Betty before
		they begin?
    
Betty stops on her way across to Jimmy and looks to Bob the
director.
    
				BOB
		No ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
		them with themselves, so don't play it
		for real until it gets real.

    
Betty doesn't know what to say. She catches Sarah's
assistant, Nicki, rolling her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Okay.
    
Betty continues walking toward Jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. He's old enough to be her father.
    
				JIMMY
		Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
    
				BETTY
		What?
    
				JIMMY
		I want to play this one close, Bob. Like
		it was with that girl, what's her name,
		with the black hair. That felt good.
		Whaddya think?
    
Betty looks from Jimmy to Bob.
    
				BOB
		That'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush
		that line again. I told you... the line
		where you say, "Before what?"
    
				JIMMY
		I was playin' off 'em. They say,
		"They'll arrest you"... and stuff like
		that.. "put you in jail"... they say it
		like that. They all say it the same way,
		so I react like that.
    
Jimmy turns to Betty.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Look ... what's your name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I
		don't rush it. We play it close, just
		like in the movies.
    
Jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around Betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Dad's best friend goes to work.

    
Jimmy smiles as he brings Betty a little closer. She is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and Jimmy's
breath. There is a silence as Jimmy looks her in the eyes.
Everyone in the room is looking Betty in the eyes.
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		And ... ACTION!
    
Betty and Jimmy start the scene. It is very difficult for
Betty as Jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
    
				BETTY
		You're still here?
    
				JIMMY
		I came back. I thought that's what you
		wanted.
    
Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
    
				BETTY
		Nobody wants you here.
    
Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
    
				JIMMY
		Really?
    
Betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
    
				BETTY
		My parents are right upstairs! They
		think you've left.
    
Jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		So ... surprise!
    
Betty pushes him back.
    
				BETTY
		I can call them... I can call my dad.
    
				JIMMY
		But you won't.

    
He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
She's surprising herself.
    
				BETTY
			(almost a hot whisper)
		You're playing a dangerous game here. if
		you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
		going to work.
    
Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		You know what I want...it's not that
		difficult.
    
Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering desperately -
			slowly)
		Get out... Get out before I call my dad.
		He trusts you... you're his best friend.
			(her arms go around him)
		This will be the end of everything.
    
Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He
can only see Betty's eyes.
    
				JIMMY
		What about you? What will your dad think
		about you?
    
Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
    
				BETTY
		Stop... just stop! That's what you said
		from the beginning. If I tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put
		you in jail, so get out of here before...
    
				JIMMY
			(caught by her transfixing,
			sultry eyes, and almost
			breathless ... he finds himself
			taking an extra long pause)
		Before what?
    
As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
    
				BETTY
			(as she kisses him - whispers)
		Before I kill you.
    
Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
finally is able to say his line.
    
				JIMMY
		Then they'd put you in jail.
    
As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
cheeks. She backs away.
    
				BETTY
		I hate you... I hate us both!
    
She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
    
Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. Sarah turns to Nicki.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		I'm going to take her over there.
    
				NICKI
		Big time!
    
				WALLY
			(to everyone)
		Wow!
    
Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
    
				BETTY
		Well, there it was.

    
				JIMMY
		There it was it was! Baby, you got a
		way!
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		Very good. Really. I mean it was forced
		maybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very
		good, really.
    
				WALLY
		Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
		That was very impressive. You've done
		your Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her
		the first chance I get. We'll speak again
		soon I'm sure, and thank you so much for
		coming in.
    
				BETTY
		Well, thank you.
    
Betty doesn't quite know what to do. She moves to the center
of the room and just stands. Remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
    
Sarah stands and Nicki stands just after.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a
		lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
    
				WALLY
		Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah,
		and don't you be a stranger. We'd love to
		see you around here again real soon.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Well come along, Betty.
    
Sarah takes Betty's hand and they go to the door. Betty turns
back once more and smiles.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
		meeting all of you.
    
Everyone nods and waves and Betty is taken out by Sarah and
Nicki.

her face.

				SARAH JAMES
		Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.
		I love Wally. I ought to. I was married

Betty does another shocked head turn.

		And I love actors, all actors, Jimmy Katz
		included. We just get a little catty

INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
song continues to play over.

As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

				ADAM
			(calling out through an
			electronic megaphone)
		Cut it!
    
He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. He shakes her hand.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Thank you very much, Carol. It was really
		great of you to come in. I know how busy
		you are.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this
		script! Where do I sign?

    
				ADAM
		Look... I love you, but there's no way
		they're gonna let me cast this thing
		until I've seen everyone. I'll let you
		know as soon as I can.
    
				CAROL
		I know you will ... cause my manager's
		gonna bug you day and night ... me too.
    
				ADAM
		It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
		here.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
		me. I'm the girl that's going to play
		this part.
    
				ADAM
			(lightly pinching her cheek)
		See ya later.
    
Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to
some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant
Director and looks down at the man's notepad.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Who's next, Hank?
    
				HANK
		Camilla Rhodes.
    
Adam wonders - worries.
    
				ADAM
		Is she ready?
    
				HANK
		All ready.
    
				ADAM
		Bring her out.
    
Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
    
				HANK
			(through walkie-talkie)
		Camilla Rhodes next!

    
Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
singers step in behind her.
    
Adam nods to Hank.
    
				HANK (cont'd)
		Turn over!
    
The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
    
				ADAM
			(through megaphone)
		Playback!
    
Countdown before the music begins.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		ACTION!
    
The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
    
On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him.
    
				HANK
		Yeah?
    
Adam pauses.
    
				ADAM
		Get Jason over here.
    
Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
    
				HANK
		Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
    
Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
    
				JASON
		Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

    
				ADAM
		This is the girl!
    
At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
He smiles at Adam.
    
				RAY
		Excellent choice, Adam.
    
Adam is sick with himself.
    
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
    
				BETTY
		Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
		promised a friend.
    
She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm
sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella.
    
Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
    
Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over
Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty
disappear out the sound stage door.

Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
    
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
    
				BETTY
		C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
    
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Hey!

    
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd)
		Hey, how's Sol?
    
				BETTY
		Sol?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		No ... not you...
			(to Rita)
		I'm sorry... I forget your name.
    
				RITA
			(almost inaudible)
		Rita.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately.
		Tell him to come by the club.
    
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
    
				BETTY
		And what's your name?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
			(big smile)
		Cornell Dumont.
    
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering)
		Ask him who Sol is ...
    
Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe he could help...

Betty reaches and gently grabs Rita's shoulder. She speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

    
				BETTY
		Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
    
				RITA
			(whispering back)
		But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of
		Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why
		we shouldn't go see about Diane
		Selwyn... it's better not to get in
		trouble.
    
				BETTY
		You're not going to get in trouble.
		You're going to find out who you are.
		Finding out who you are gets you out of

Rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again.

Betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand.
She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides

		It should be around here...
    
Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(points)
		That's it ... 2590.
			(nudging Rita)
		Does it look familiar?
    
Rita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men
sitting in the front.
    
				RITA
		Don't stop!
    
				BETTY
		What is it? What do you see?!
    
				RITA
			(quietly - frantic)
		Those men in front, in the car.

Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
    
				BETTY
		Selwyn ... number 12.
    
They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		It's this way.
    
They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
    
Both girls dive for the bushes.
    
The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(panting whisper)
		Now, you've got me scared.
    
Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
    

He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		See, I told you there was nothing to be
		afraid of!
    
They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
    
				RITA
		Oh no ... don't.
    
Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
    
				RITA (cont'd)
		No one's ...
    
Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Yes?
    
				BETTY
		Diane?
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Number 17.
    
				BETTY
		But it said #12.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		I switched apartments with her. She's in
		#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
		to the right.
    
The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		It's kind of hidden by the foliage.
    
Betty and Rita start to leave.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		She hasn't been around for a few days ...

    
				BETTY
		Well ... we'll leave her a note.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
			(starting toward them)
		I'll go with you. She's still got some of
		my stuff.
    
The phone rings from inside her bungalow.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
			(turning back)
		Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.
    
The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
    
				BETTY
		I guess you're not Diane.
    
Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
    
They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Still not home I guess.
    
The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.
    
				RITA
		I don't think...
    
				BETTY
			(looking around for anyone
			watching)
		C'mon help me in. I'll open the front
		door.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
    
				BETTY
		PUSH!!!

    
Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Meet you at the door.
    
Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I don't know if you want to come in here
		or not. There's some kind of horrible
		smell like... something...
    
Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.

Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows.
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. They move

to Rita to see if any of this is something she remembers.
Rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.

Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream
starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.
    
In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.

her bungalow.
    
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.

Sounds, music churning continues.
    
Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding
the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets
Betty hold her. Music changes ...
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I know what you're doing.

			(through uncontrollable sobs)
		What ... I..HAVE... to do.
    
				BETTY
		I know what you have to do, but let me do

Rita turns and looks up at Betty, her eyes red with crying.
Betty pulls her up facing her. Rita lets Betty take the
scissors. They look into each other's eyes. Betty gently
strokes Rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror. She has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.

out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.

Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox

money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.

		You've been so good to me ... now we know

Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and

Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.

Mulholland Drive.

The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets

down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-

Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to

As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.

corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.
    
CLOSER ON DAN
    
Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
    
The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
    
Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
    
Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
    
Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.
    
				HERB
		Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!
    
He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse
in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.

		My God!

A blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us. As the
blonde's face fills the screen we move with her and stay with
her as she goes. Her face is bright and her eyes move here
and there taking in everything. She can hardly believe she's
in Los Angeles - the City of Dreams. She and the old woman
pass under a sign which reads "WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES."
The girl smiles and looks around excited by every detail.

The girl and the old lady exit the terminal with their bags.
An older gentleman has joined the old lady. They stop at the
taxicab stand. The old lady takes the blonde girl's hand.
    
				OLD LADY
		It's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's
		been so nice travelling with you.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and
		nervous. It was sure great to have you
		to talk to.
    
				IRENE
		Now, remember I'll be watching for you on

				BETTY
			(smiling)
		Okay Irene. Won't that be the day.

				IRENE
		The best of luck to you, Betty. Take
		care of yourself and be careful.

    
				BETTY
		Okay I will. Thanks again.
    
Betty and Irene give each other a hug. The old gentleman nods
to Betty and takes Irene off. Betty smiles after them.
Suddenly someone is grabbing her bags. She turns abruptly to
find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. She turns
once more and waves at Irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.
    
				CAB DRIVER
		Where to?
    
				BETTY
			(smiling excitedly)
		1612 Havenhurst.

		Got it!
    
They get into the cab and close their doors. The cab pulls
away.

EXT. STREETS - LOS ANGELES - DAY
    
Betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. Each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega,
Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire
Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn
right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst
and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.
    
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. 1612 HAVENHURST
    
The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell.

    
An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
    
				MANAGER
		Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.

				BETTY
		I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois
		isn't it?
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		In all my living glory, baby.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				MRS. LANOIS
		You can call me Coco ... everybody does.
		Stay there, I'll get the key.
    
				BETTY
		Okay, Coco.
    
Coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. She starts off into the
courtyard and Betty picks up her bags and follows. As Coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
    
				COCO
		I guess it was your grandfather, was
		it ... he called me to check in, said you
		were on your way and for you to call when
		you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
    
				BETTY
		Yes, he is. He raises corn.
    
				COCO
		Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood
		these days too.
    
				BETTY
		Well, I ...
    
				COCO
		You don't have to tell me. It's written
		all over that pretty face of yours.. You
		came here to be an actress. I just hope
		you'll remember there's never been a
		great poem called "tits and ass."
    
    
				BETTY
		I...
    
				COCO
		You probably don't remember her, but
		Louise Bonner lives right over there in
		number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs
		a damn good acting class.
    
				BETTY
		Have many famous actors and actresses
		lived here? I was meaning to ask you
		that.
    
				COCO
		Honey, all the great ones came through
		here at one time or another.
    
A haunting music begins to swell.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
    
		People say in the springtime when the
		wind blows the smell of the jasmine you
		can still feel the presence of everyone
		of them.
    
				BETTY
		I guess I've come to quite a place.
    
				COCO
		Sweetheart, you don't know the half of
		it.
    
The music fades.
    
Coco looks down suddenly. On the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
			(yelling up)
		WILKINS! ... (no answer) ... THAT DOG CRAPS

Coco turns back to Betty.
    
				COCO (cont'd)
		You don't have pets do you?

    
				BETTY
		No, I don't.
    
				COCO
		That's good. They're allowed, but I
		don't like 'em...for obvious reasons.
		One man used to live here that had a
		prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't

The dirty and torn black cocktail dress of the dark-haired
woman along with her shoes, purse and undergarments are in a
pile in the bedroom. We drift off them toward the bathroom
where the dark-haired woman can be seen showering through
rippled glass. There's the sound of a door opening. We see a
movement through the glass and the shower goes off instantly.
We can hear the dark-haired woman's frightened breathing as
she waits frozen listening.

Betty enters, thrilled with what she sees. The apartment is

bags down and stares.
    
				BETTY
		It's unbelievable!
    
				COCO
		I told ya.
    
				BETTY
		Wow!
    
				COCO
		Now I guess you and your Aunt have an
		understanding. So here's the key and you
		need anything, just give a holler.
			(Coco hands Betty the key)
		Everybody in this building's pretty much
		okay with me or they wouldn't be here.
		If you want, later I'll introduce you
		around. No hard feelings if you don't,
		and don't forget the rooftop garden.
		It's just up the stairs we passed. It's
		open to all the tenants. You can see the
		Hollywood sign from there.
    
				BETTY
		Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

				COCO
		You got it! See you later honey.
    
Coco leaves and closes the door behind her. Betty begins to
explore the apartment.- After walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. She moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. She goes into the
bedroom. She smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. She notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. She
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling
tiles. As she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in
the mirror above it. Suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. There before her is the naked,
beautiful dark-haired woman.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my!
    
She quickly closes the shower door.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I'm sorry. My Aunt ... Ruth didn't tell
		me someone was going to be here. I'm so
		sorry.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		That's okay.
    
				BETTY
		I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm

There's a silence.
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		There was an accident. I came here.

				BETTY
		I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm
		sorry.   Are you all right?

    
There is another silence.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What happened?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		A car ... a car accident.
    
				BETTY
		Are you okay?
    
				DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
		I think so. I was just taking a shower.
    
				BETTY
		Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get
		back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
    
Betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she
stops and looks back in.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What's your name?
    
We see a close-up of the dark-haired woman. We see her eyes
widen with a kind of fear. She's frantically thinking -
searching her mind for an answer.

		I'm sorry. I'll get out of here and we

				BETTY
		She sure is. She's letting me stay here
		while she's working on a movie that's
		being made in Canada, but I guess you
		know that.  I couldn't afford a place
		like this in a million years. Unless of
		course I'm discovered and become a movie
		star. Of course, I'd rather be known as
		a great actress than a movie star, but
		sometimes people end up being both and
		that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I

Rita motions to her head above her forehead. Betty looks
through her hair and finds her wound which has stopped
bleeding but is surrounded by a very large blue black
bruising.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		We should get a doctor.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
				BETTY
		But, this could be serious.

				RITA
		No...I need to sleep.
    
				BETTY
		If you have a concussion you shouldn't
		sleep.
    
				RITA
		It will be okay if I sleep. I need to
		lie down and sleep.

				BETTY
		All right, but...I'm going to check on
		you.
    
Rita lies down and is instantly asleep. Betty leans over her
and listens to her breathing. She gets a blanket and drapes
it over the beautiful sleeping Rita, then leaves the room.

The street level of the office building is filthy and houses

INT. OFFICE ON SIXTH FLOOR
    
Two men are in the room, JOE and ED. Joe leans up against a
rack of filing cabinets. He is in his late twenties. He
looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker - wears a blue
denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
    
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.
    
				JOE
		So man, that's unheard of ... an accident
		like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
    
				ED
		Unreal ... so, you're looking good.
		Whatcha doin' these days?
    
				JOE
		Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff
		for this guy.
    
				ED
		Making ends meet, huh.
    
				JOE
		Hardly.
    
				ED
		Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
    
				JOE
		Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope
		you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
    
				ED
		It was just a thing. The story made you
		laugh.
    
				JOE
		Yeah, that's a funny story.
    
Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the
desk - to a small worn black book.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		So, there it is ... Ed's famous black book.

    
				ED
		Yeah, the history of the world in phone
		numbers.
    
Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view
holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
scream.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh...man!
    
With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		Hey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
		and use the phone. Help me out. You
		gotta call the hospital.
    
The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
seeing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		I mean it! Get down here quick! She's
		hurt and I can't do everything myself,
		man.

    
Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
		No, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
    
He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
    
				JOE (cont'd)
			(disgusted with himself)
		Oh ... man!
    
Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.
    
				VOICES
		What the hell .... what happened? What's
		this cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
		It's the vacuum what did it.
    
Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

The men in dark suits go in as if they owned the place. Ray,
Mr. Darby and Robert Smith stand immediately. Adam remains
seated. Mr. Darby is the only one near enough to attempt a
hand shake, but when he offers his hand it is not taken. The
men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and
without acknowledging anyone. One of the men in a dark suit
opens a briefcase. Ray has been trying to make
introductions.
    
				RAY
		Ah... the Castigliane brothers. Let me
		introduce you around ... please ... sit down.
		(after they've already seated
		themselves) ... this is Mr. Darby whom you

		Kesher and his manager Robert Smith
    
The Castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this,
however, during the introductions the one with the briefcase
removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of Ray.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Ah... she's very pretty.
    
We see the photo of the girl - of a nice looking blonde -
someone we've never seen before. Adam looks like he doesn't
know what's going on and he's getting upset about not
knowing. His manager, Robert Smith, is beginning to see the
makings of a confrontation - he's starting to panic.

		What girl? For what? What is this Ray?
    
Ray, still standing with a forced smile, turns to the
Castigliane brothers.
    
				RAY
		We'd be happy to put her in the pile for

Luigi Castigliane's espresso is brought in by the man who had
been in earlier. The man sets the espresso down in front of
Luigi and takes a step back. The room becomes silent -
watching the Espresso Man and Luigi. Without looking up Luigi
speaks softly.

The Espresso Man leaves the room. Luigi looks at the
espresso. Vincenzo stares at Adam.
    
Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo. The Espresso
man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the
espresso.

Luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very
still waiting, the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room.
    
Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the
espresso cup. He looks around at Ray and Mr. Darby - seeing
them stare at the espresso cup.
    
Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam.
    
Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand.
With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it
above the napkin. He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth.
He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso
to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in
that position for a moment.
    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		Is shit!
    
Luigi Castigliane stands up.
    
				RAY
		I'm sorry. That was a highly
		recommended...
    
				MR. DARBY
		That's considered one of the finest
		espressos in the world , Sir.
    
Luigi just stands there. A small thread on his left suit
jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back
into the fabric. Vincenzo closes his briefcase, takes out a
hankerchief and cleans his nose - then stands, placing the
handkerchief back in his pocket.
    
				ADAM
		Wait a minute!! What's going on here?
    
Vincenzo just stares toward Adam as if he's not even there.
    
				ADAM
		There's no way that girl is in my movie!
    
Silence.

    
				LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
		That is the girl.
    
The Castigliane brothers begin to leave. Adam stands up
trembling with anger.
    
				ADAM
		Hey!!!!! That girl is not in my film!!!
    
				VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE
		It is no longer your film.
    
Adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in. The
Castigliane brothers leave. As the big blonde wood doors
close behind them Adam starts to boil.
    
				ADAM
			(screaming)
		You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
    
				RAY
		I'll speak to someone.
    
				ADAM
			(turning to his manager)
		And you'd better speak to someone
		too ... or find yourself another client!!
		This smells like a set-up to me!
			(back to Ray)
		And by the way, Ray, I don't know who
		these guys are kidding, but every foot of
		film I've shot is in a vault at the lab
		that only I can access. No one's getting
		that film!!
    
				ROBERT SMITH
		This is a catastrophe...
			(turning toward Ray)
		you told me they might insist on a girl,
		that's all.
    
				ADAM
		Why didn't you tell me, Robert? That's
		what I mean ... you set me up! I woulda
		never come here.
			(standing)
		I'm leaving. I'm a director you don't
		want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!
    
Adam storms out of the room.

Adam exits the building carrying his 7-iron. An attendant
takes his valet parking ticket. While Adam, still fuming,
waits for his car he notices the big limo standing off to one
side. He stares at the car and the huge limo driver leaning
up against the front driver's side door.
    
Adam's car arrives - a late model Porsche. Before Adam gets
into his car he addresses the attendant.
    
				ADAM
		Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
		that limo?
    
				ATTENDANT
		They two guys in dark suits?
    
Adam nods and walks over to the limo. The limo driver eyes
him and his 7-iron suspiciously.
    
				ADAM
		Castigliane brothers?
    
				LIMO DRIVER
		Beat it!
    
				ADAM
		O.K.
    
Adam raises his 7-iron and smashes out the limo's windshield.
He whacks two big dents in the hood, then smashes out a
headlight. The limo driver starts towards him. Adam laughs,
runs to his car and takes off.

INT. AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - LATER DAY
    
Betty is stretched out on the big leather couch in the living
room. A half eaten sandwich and chips are on a plate on the
coffee table next to her. She is talking on the phone.

    
				BETTY
		No Grandpa, you wouldn't believe it.
		It's more beautiful than I ever
		dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food.
		The refrigerator's full ... Aunt Ruthie
		said she'd call me when she got
		settled... it was real smooth. I sat next
		to a lady who gave up her first class
		seat to a boy with a broken leg. She was
		so nice to me. She invited me to her
		house sometime. It's in Bel Air which is
		a place where people have a lot of
		money... I will. Everybody's telling me
		to be careful, but I sure love it here
		Grandpa. Thank you for helping me get
		here ... yeah, it's long distance. I love
		you. Say hello to Grams. Give her a big
		kiss for me. Okay, I love you
		Grandpa ... bye.
    
Betty hangs up the phone, takes a big bite of her sandwich
and lays flat out on the couch, chewing and smiling up at the
ceiling. She suddenly remembers Rita and her promise to look
in on her. She gets off the couch and goes into the bedroom.

INT. - EXT. APARTMENT - DAY
    
Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
    
Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee.
The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. The phone inside rings. Betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. She crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.
    
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Hello ... Aunt Ruth!! I can't tell you how
		happy I am. Your place is so fantastic!
		Yes ... Coco...what a character. I really
		like her... that's too bad...waiting in an
		airport must not be too fun. What's a
		mosquito plane? ... Oh I get it. How long
		does that take from Montreal? ... Well,
		you'll sleep good tonight ... Hudson Bay
		sounds beautiful ...oh well, I hope you
		packed your coat. (laughs). You mean
		the audition...Wally Brown... she didn't
		mention it but he'll fax the dialogue to
		Coco? Suddenly I'm so nervous ... okay
		Aunt Ruth... I'll try. I'll study those
		lines until I know them inside out.
		Yes, either right here on this fabulous
		leather couch or I'll take them with a
		coffee in the courtyard like a regular
		movie star. (laughs). Oh! I got a real
		shock to find your friend Rita here. She
		was in the shower and I opened the
		door ... Rita ... what do you mean? She was
		in an accident ... your friend Rita. No,
		Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't
		see her. She's sleeping. No... she's
		very nice. I'm sure there's some
		explanation, Aunt Ruth... I don't think we
		have to do that. Please don't worry.
		I'll take care of it. No, I'll let you
		know. Where can I ... okay I'll get it
		from Coco.
		No, please don't worry... thank you so
		much for letting me stay here. You've
		made me so happy... thank you, thank you.
		Please don't worry... Aunt Ruth we don't
		need the police. I'll call you when you
		get to Hudson Bay. Please...
		please ... Goodbye Aunt Ruth.
    
Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. She sits for a
moment listening. Silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. As she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. Rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. Betty goes into the bedroom. Rita looks up
at her with desperation.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You're awake... I think I misunderstood
		you. I thought you knew my Aunt and
		that's why you were here. I just talked
		to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me
		to call the police.

    
Rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with
her hands.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Rita?
    
				RITA
			(crying harder)
		I'm... sorry. I ...

Betty's heart softens.
    
				BETTY
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(still sobbing)
		I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke
		up... I thought sleep would do it ...
    
Betty kneels down in front of her.
    
				BETTY
		What's wrong?
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I don't know who I am.
    
				BETTY
		What do you mean? You're Rita.
    
				RITA
			(crying)
		I'm not. I don't know what my name is.
		I don't know who I am!!
    
Betty looks down at the purse next to Rita's dress. She picks
it up and hands it to Rita.
    
				BETTY
		This is your purse. Your name must be in
		your purse.
    
Rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. She hesitates.
Something is worrying her. She looks at Betty for help.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		You want to know don't you?
    
				RITA
		I ... yes, but ... I ...

    
				BETTY
		Open it!
    
Rita slowly unzips the purse. The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
    
Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.
    
Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of horror.
(note: This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)

INTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
    
Ray crosses a carpeted closed area. He mounts a flight of
stairs. At the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. Ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. At the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. Again Ray punches in a code. The elevator opens and
Ray goes in. The elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. Ray waits. Finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
		Who is it please?
    
				RAY
		Raymond Harris ... 20743.
    
The elevator begins to move up. When it stops, the door opens
and Ray walks into a windowless reception area where a
beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
			(very quietly)
		You may go right in, Ray.
    
Ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. The
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. Heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
    
    
Ray enters and the doors close behind him. Ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
    
				RAY
		Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced
		Rowk).
    
Mr. Roque stares at Ray silently.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Do you want him replaced?
    
Mr. Roque continues to stare.
    
				RAY
		I know they said...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Then?
    
				RAY
		Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but
		that means we should ...
    
				MR. ROQUE
		Yes?
    
				RAY
		Shut everything down ... Is that something

		down?
    
Silence. Ray doesn't know what to do. He struggles to
interpret Mr. Roque's silence. He waits. Mr. Roque does
nothing but stare.
    
				RAY (cont'd)
		Then we'll shut everything down.
    
Silence.
    
Ray turns. The doors open as he approaches them and he
leaves the room. The doors close.

		Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

		No, no, no, I told you. They're fine.

Taka reaches out his hand and Adam shakes it.
    
				ADAM
		Hello Taka. It's 'cause I'm never home
		in the day time. It's good to see you
		again. The garden looks great.
    
Taka bows, smiling and nodding, and goes back to work. Adam
heads toward the front door of his house.

INT. - ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY
    
Adam enters, puts his 7-iron in his golf bag just inside the
door, then looks around. He can see the pool through a wall
of plate glass windows, but there is no one visible poolside.
    
				ADAM
			(calling out)
		Lorraine...
			(then louder)
		Lorraine ... you home?
    
He hears a noise, something falling. He walks in the
direction of the noise. It leads him to his bedroom. His
expression darkens as he approaches the closed door. He
hears voices as he throws the door open.
    
LORRAINE and the poolman GENE are in bed.
    
				LORRAINE
		Now, you've done it!
    
				GENE
		Just forget you ever saw it. It's better
		that way.
    
				LORRAINE
		What the hell are you even doing here?
    
Adam stands stunned for a moment. Then finds himself walking
over to the dresser and opening the top drawer. He removes a
large case.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		What are you doing?
    
Adam starts walking out of the bedroom with the case.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		THAT'S MY JEWELRY!!!
    
Adam leaves the bedroom and starts through the house. He
goes into the kitchen and looks around - numb but trying to
think.

INT. ADAM AND LORRAINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
    
Lorraine is getting dressed as fast as she can.

		He's probably upset Lorraine.
    
							CUT TO:
    
INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - DAY
    
Adam leaves the kitchen and goes out into the garage. He
turns on the light and looks around. He spots some paint
cans on a shelf and grabs one and goes back into the kitchen.
He can hear Lorraine calling his name. She seems to be
coming closer. He sets the jewelry case and the paint can on
the floor, kneels down and opens the paint can with his car
key. Just as Lorraine enters the kitchen, he opens the
jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of Hot Pink
paint into her jewelry case.
    
				LORRAINE
		WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???
    
He puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them
about. Lorraine rushes toward him.
    
				LORRAINE (cont'd)
		STOP IT!!!
    
Lorraine grabs hold of him. Starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. She tears his jacket. Adam stands all at
once and with his wet Hot Pink hands he pushes Lorraine and
slams her into the kitchen counter just as Gene the poolman
enters. Gene grabs ahold of Adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into Adam's face.
    
				GENE
		That's not a way to treat your wife,
		buddy. I don't care what she's done.
    
Adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries
to hit Gene. Gene blocks his punch and slams Adam again,
knocking him down to the kitchen floor where he lands and
spills the jewelry case. Adam, now covered with paint, is
picked up by Gene and thrown out toward the front door.
    
				LORRAINE
		Throw him out!
    
Lorraine opens the front door while Gene picks Adam up, moves
him across the carpet and heaves him out onto the front lawn.
Lorraine slams the door behind him.
    
Adam picks himself up, severely dazed and bleeding pretty
badly, he heads for his car.

    
Taka stops gardening and smiles and bows at Adam as he gets
into his car.
    
Adam drives away - pink paint and red blood all over.

INT.  AUNT RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAY
    
Rita is now dressed to go out and is studying herself in a
mirror. She turns and her gaze falls to her purse. She
picks it up and looks questioningly at Betty.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		No ... you shouldn't take that. Let's hide
		it.
    
They look around the room... There's a hatbox in the closet
above the clothes rack. Betty brings it down, takes out the
hat, and Rita puts the purse inside. Betty puts the hat over
the purse in the hatbox and puts in back in the closet.
Betty puts out her hand. Rita looks at it for a moment,
smiles, and they shake.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
    
Betty and Rita walk along. Birds are chirping in the trees
which line both sides of the street. Betty is smiling and
once again looking around at everything. Her good mood and
excitement about life lifts Rita's spirits.
    
Coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. The boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. As the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk Betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.

    
After they pass each other Betty turns back and sees the boy
and the woman enter 1612 Havenhurst. Betty and Rita continue
up the street.

PAYPHONE ON RED BRICK WALL - DAY
    
We see the red brick building. It is Denny's. Betty and
Rita are walking to the payphone. Betty digs out some change
from her purse. She picks up the receiver, drops in a
quarter and dials the "0" for Operator. An Operator answers.
    
				BETTY
		Hollywood Police Department please.
    
				OPERATOR
		Is this an emergency?
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I just want the number.
    
				OPERATOR
		Hold for the number.
    
Betty gets the number for the Hollywood Police Station, re-
deposits the quarter and dials.

		Hollywood Police Department
    
				BETTY
		I'm inquiring about an accident that
		happened last night on Mulholland Drive.

Betty holds.

		Traffic. Sergeant Baxter speaking.

    
				BETTY
		Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a
		sound last night that sounded like a car
		crash and I want to know if there was an
		accident on Mulholland Drive.
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		Yes, there was.
    
				BETTY
		Can you tell me what happened?
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		No. I can't.
    
				BETTY
		Was anyone hurt?
    
				SERGEANT BAXTER
		May I have your name please?
    
Betty hangs up. She turns to Rita smiling like a girl who's
done something bad and gotten away with it.
    
				BETTY
		There was an accident. He wouldn't tell
		me anything else, but that was your
		accident Rita. I just know it was.
		Maybe there's something about it in the

Betty and Rita enter Denny's.

INT.- DENNY'S - DAY
    
Rita and Betty are seated next to the table where Dan and
Herb sat earlier in the day. They both have a cup of coffee
in front of them. Betty has a newspaper open and she is
scanning the last pages.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe it happened so late it's not going
		to be in today's paper.
    
				RITA
		There's nothing?
    
				BETTY
		Not that I can see.

    
The same waitress - Diane, comes up to the girl's table and
freshens up their coffee. Betty looks up and smiles, sees
Diane's nameplate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Thank you ... Diane.
    
Rita shoots a look from Betty to Diane to the nameplate.

Diane finishes pouring Rita's cup and smiles at Betty.
    
				DIANE
		You're welcome. Will that be all? You

				BETTY
		Just the coffee. Rita, you want
		something?
    
				RITA
			(still staring at the nameplate
			- thinking)
		No. Just the coffee.
    
				BETTY
		We'll take our check.
    
Diane searches through her many checks to find Betty and
Rita's.
    
The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue
dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the
manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her
eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes
out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's
check as she places it on their table. She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty
noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the
woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then
leaving.

    
The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her
pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the
manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she
goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense
and lost in a thought.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		What is it Rita?
    
				RITA
			(without moving a muscle)
		Shhhh.
    
At that moment Diane the waitress reappears at their table.
Diane looks Betty in the eye and while looking at Betty her
left hand slides the Mont Blanc out from under the check and
back into her pocket.
    
				DIANE
		Thank you. Come in again.
    
Betty holds her gaze.
    
				BETTY
		You're welcome. We will.
    
Relieved Diane leaves and goes about her business. Betty
looks over at Rita waiting for her to tell her something.
Rita slowly turns and focuses on Betty.

		I remember something... I remember

AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
    
Betty and Rita are sitting next to each other on the leather
couch. Betty is rifling through the phone book. She finds
the listings for Selwyn. Her finger drifts down and finds D.
Selwyn followed by an address and phone number. It is the
only Selwyn with a D. first name. She hands the phone to
Rita.
    
				BETTY
		Strange to be calling yourself.
    
				RITA
		Maybe it's not me.
    
				BETTY
		Call the number.
    
Betty reads the number off and Rita pushes the corresponding
buttons. Each tone seems to be louder than the last. The
ringing seems deafening. There's a click and the phone is
answered - by a machine. A woman's voice is heard - loudly.
    
				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(coming from answering machine)
		Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message.
    
Betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also -
straining to hear everything. The machine starts recording.
Betty hangs up the phone immediately.
    
				RITA
		It's not my voice ... but I know her.
    
				BETTY
		Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn.
		Maybe that's your roommate or if it is

TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking
down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front
door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back.
    
Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers.
Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is
on her face and clothes.
    
				KENNY
		Adam Kesher...he...
    
				LORRAINE
		Yeah, right ... get lost!
    
She slams the door, but Kenny's foot stops it and pushes it
back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open
once again. Kenny enters the house.
    
				KENNY
		This is Adam Kesher's house. Where...
    
				LORRAINE
		Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!!
    
Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with
pink paint.
    
				GENE
		I guess you don't understand English.
		She asked to leave. Here's the door.
    
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door.
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.

    
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -
spilling out onto the kitchen floor. Finishing his work with
the vintage golf clubs - Kenny leaves.

Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon
road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area
gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a
dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in
a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No
one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling
stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from
the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the
brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light
is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled
unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red
embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string
tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The
Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front
of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.

		I agree with what you said...truly.
    
				COWBOY
		What did I say?

		That a man's attitude determines to a

		How's that?

    
				COWBOY
		Well, just stop for a little second and

		Okay, I'm thinking.

				COWBOY
		There's sometimes a buggy. How many
		drivers does a buggy have?
    
				ADAM
		One.
    
				COWBOY
		So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy
		and you fix your attitude and you can
		ride along with me.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
				COWBOY
		Now I know a few things. I know you have
		had a rough day. You're probably thinkin'
		I don't know the half of it, but in
		actual fact I know every part of it. The
		business of gittin' thrown off your
		movie, the heartache of seeing your wife
		with another man... losin' access to that
		precious film vault...
    
Adam suddenly looks stunned, unsure.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		... realizin' you don't have hardly a
		nickel to your name and then add on to
		that the sickenin' feeling some men are
		gonna catch you and hurt you bad for
		bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like
		that. They are rough, but what will
		tomorrow bring? Will it be better than
		today? The same ... or worse?
		A lot of that is up to us individually.
		Up to us and our attitude. When the
		Castigliane brothers said "This is no
		longer your film," they meant it, but
		they didn't mean you were not going to
		direct it. I want you to go back to work
		tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
		actress anyway ... audition many girls for
		the part. When you see the girl that was
		shown to you earlier today, you will say
		" This is the girl." The rest of the
		cast can stay- that is up to you, but
		that lead girl is not up to you. Now,
		you will see me one more time if you do
		good. You will see me two more times if
		you do bad. Good night.
    
The Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness.
Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing, then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the
Cowboy.
    
				COWBOY (cont'd)
		You thinkin' this'll work out, cause I
		was thinkin' it just might.
    
				ADAM
		It will work out.
    
				COWBOY
		Good then, but, just in case, that bank's
		gonna stay closed a bit longer. You
		understand that?
    
				ADAM
		I understand.
    
				COWBOY
		You're an understandin' fella.
    
				ADAM
		So, this is the last time I see you then
		unless I do bad?
    
				COWBOY
		No, this one doesn't count. It's part of
		the original one. So then ... until we meet
		again.
    
				ADAM
		Okay.
    
Adam gets in his car and drives off leaving the Cowboy
smiling behind him.

		in jail, so get out of here before..."
    
				RITA
		"Before what?"
    
Betty pulls a table knife out from behind her back.
    
				BETTY
		"Before I kill you."

				RITA
		"Then they'd put you in jail."
    
Betty mimes with moving fingers tears flowing from her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big

Betty drops the kitchen knife and both girls start laughing.

		Such a lame scene.

				COCO
		She wants to know who's staying in her

				BETTY
			(slowly, deliberately)
		It's just for a night or two, until she
		finds her own place. I tried to explain

		Sweetie, look at me straight.
    
Betty lifts her eyes to Coco's. Direct, clear.

		Coco...she's very nice. We went to

		Well he said...  you know in his way... you

Betty walks down the long corridor past several offices. The

side.
    
				RECEPTIONIST
		May I help you?

    
				BETTY
		My name is Betty Elms. I'm here to

		Good. Perfect timing. Have a seat and

The receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then
enters.
    
She closes the door behind her and Betty is alone in the
sitting room. She sits on a couch and looks at the old
movie posters covering all four walls.
    
In a moment the same door opens again and an elderly,
distinguished looking gentleman WALLY BROWN comes out
smiling. Betty stands up immediately.
    
				WALLY

		I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear

		Very pleased to meet you.

				WALLY
		Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
    
As they walk into Wally's office...
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		I took the liberty of inviting an extra
		person to see your audition. She saw
		your resume picture and was very
		interested in meeting you.
    
Inside Wally's office several people rise out of chairs when
Wally enters with Betty.
    
				WALLY (cont'd)
		Betty Elms this is Jack Taft, my
		assistant, Jimmy Katz who we've already
		cast for the part of "Chuck". He'll be
		doing the scene with you.
		This is Julie Chadwick and Bob Brooker,
		the director, and our surprise guest is
		Sarah James. We couldn't afford her to
		cast our picture, but as casting agents
		go she's the best.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.
    
She and Betty shake hands.
    
				BETTY
		Pleased to meet you.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		This is Nicki, my assistant.
    
Nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to Betty.
    
				WALLY
		And this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who
		you met out front.
    
Betty nervously smiles to the room.
    
				BETTY
		Hi.
    
				WALLY
		Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like
		a water or a coffee before we begin?
    
Betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
    
				BETTY
		No, no, I'm fine.
    
				WALLY
		Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty
		why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play
		the scene. Is there anything you'd like
		to say Bob... something to Betty before
		they begin?
    
Betty stops on her way across to Jimmy and looks to Bob the
director.
    
				BOB
		No ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
		them with themselves, so don't play it
		for real until it gets real.

    
Betty doesn't know what to say. She catches Sarah's
assistant, Nicki, rolling her eyes.
    
				BETTY
		Okay.
    
Betty continues walking toward Jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. He's old enough to be her father.
    
				JIMMY
		Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
    
				BETTY
		What?
    
				JIMMY
		I want to play this one close, Bob. Like
		it was with that girl, what's her name,
		with the black hair. That felt good.
		Whaddya think?
    
Betty looks from Jimmy to Bob.
    
				BOB
		That'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush
		that line again. I told you... the line
		where you say, "Before what?"
    
				JIMMY
		I was playin' off 'em. They say,
		"They'll arrest you"... and stuff like
		that.. "put you in jail"... they say it
		like that. They all say it the same way,
		so I react like that.
    
Jimmy turns to Betty.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Look ... what's your name?
    
				BETTY
		Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I
		don't rush it. We play it close, just
		like in the movies.
    
Jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around Betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
    
				JIMMY (cont'd)
		Dad's best friend goes to work.

    
Jimmy smiles as he brings Betty a little closer. She is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and Jimmy's
breath. There is a silence as Jimmy looks her in the eyes.
Everyone in the room is looking Betty in the eyes.
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		And ... ACTION!
    
Betty and Jimmy start the scene. It is very difficult for
Betty as Jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
    
				BETTY
		You're still here?
    
				JIMMY
		I came back. I thought that's what you
		wanted.
    
Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
    
				BETTY
		Nobody wants you here.
    
Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
    
				JIMMY
		Really?
    
Betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
    
				BETTY
		My parents are right upstairs! They
		think you've left.
    
Jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		So ... surprise!
    
Betty pushes him back.
    
				BETTY
		I can call them... I can call my dad.
    
				JIMMY
		But you won't.

    
He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
She's surprising herself.
    
				BETTY
			(almost a hot whisper)
		You're playing a dangerous game here. if
		you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
		going to work.
    
Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
    
				JIMMY
		You know what I want...it's not that
		difficult.
    
Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering desperately -
			slowly)
		Get out... Get out before I call my dad.
		He trusts you... you're his best friend.
			(her arms go around him)
		This will be the end of everything.
    
Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He
can only see Betty's eyes.
    
				JIMMY
		What about you? What will your dad think
		about you?
    
Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
    
				BETTY
		Stop... just stop! That's what you said
		from the beginning. If I tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put
		you in jail, so get out of here before...
    
				JIMMY
			(caught by her transfixing,
			sultry eyes, and almost
			breathless ... he finds himself
			taking an extra long pause)
		Before what?
    
As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
    
				BETTY
			(as she kisses him - whispers)
		Before I kill you.
    
Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
finally is able to say his line.
    
				JIMMY
		Then they'd put you in jail.
    
As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
cheeks. She backs away.
    
				BETTY
		I hate you... I hate us both!
    
She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
    
Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. Sarah turns to Nicki.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		I'm going to take her over there.
    
				NICKI
		Big time!
    
				WALLY
			(to everyone)
		Wow!
    
Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
    
				BETTY
		Well, there it was.

    
				JIMMY
		There it was it was! Baby, you got a
		way!
    
				WALLY
		Bob?
    
				BOB
		Very good. Really. I mean it was forced
		maybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very
		good, really.
    
				WALLY
		Well, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
		That was very impressive. You've done
		your Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her
		the first chance I get. We'll speak again
		soon I'm sure, and thank you so much for
		coming in.
    
				BETTY
		Well, thank you.
    
Betty doesn't quite know what to do. She moves to the center
of the room and just stands. Remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
    
Sarah stands and Nicki stands just after.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Thank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a
		lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
    
				WALLY
		Well, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah,
		and don't you be a stranger. We'd love to
		see you around here again real soon.
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Well come along, Betty.
    
Sarah takes Betty's hand and they go to the door. Betty turns
back once more and smiles.
    
				BETTY
		Thank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
		meeting all of you.
    
Everyone nods and waves and Betty is taken out by Sarah and
Nicki.

The three of them walk down the corridor.

		Oh God, that was awful!
    
Betty's head spins to Sarah. A look of shock and let down on
her face.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		Oh, not you Betty. You were stellar and
		I mean that, but poor Wally. He'll never
		get that picture made. Wally's days were
		up twenty -years ago.
    
				NICKI
			(sickening little laugh)
		How about that Jimmy Katz?
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Oh god! Jimmy Katz never had a day.
		Jimmy Katz never had a minute. Poor
		Wally.
    
Betty finds herself getting a little upset.
    
				BETTY
		They seem very nice to me, and
		Wally... Mr. Brown is a very close friend
		of my Aunt's, so. . .
    
				SARAH JAMES
		Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.
		I love Wally. I ought to. I was married
		to him for ten years.
    
Betty does another shocked head turn.
    
				SARAH JAMES (cont'd)
		And I love actors, all actors, Jimmy Katz
		included. We just get a little catty
		sometimes. Now we want to take you across
		the way and introduce you to a director
		who's a head above the rest. He's got a
		project that you would kill!
    
At the word 'kill' Betty turns to her once again with a
questioning look.

		... Knock it right out of the park.

INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
song continues to play over.

As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

				ADAM
			(calling out through an
			electronic megaphone)
		Cut it!
    
He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. He shakes her hand.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Thank you very much, Carol. It was really
		great of you to come in. I know how busy
		you are.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, man, are you kidding? I love this
		script! Where do I sign?

    
				ADAM
		Look... I love you, but there's no way
		they're gonna let me cast this thing
		until I've seen everyone. I'll let you
		know as soon as I can.
    
				CAROL
		I know you will ... cause my manager's
		gonna bug you day and night ... me too.
    
				ADAM
		It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
		here.
    
				CAROL
		Oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
		me. I'm the girl that's going to play
		this part.
    
				ADAM
			(lightly pinching her cheek)
		See ya later.
    
Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to
some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant
Director and looks down at the man's notepad.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		Who's next, Hank?
    
				HANK
		Camilla Rhodes.
    
Adam wonders - worries.
    
				ADAM
		Is she ready?
    
				HANK
		All ready.
    
				ADAM
		Bring her out.
    
Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
    
				HANK
			(through walkie-talkie)
		Camilla Rhodes next!

    
Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
singers step in behind her.
    
Adam nods to Hank.
    
				HANK (cont'd)
		Turn over!
    
The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
    
				ADAM
			(through megaphone)
		Playback!
    
Countdown before the music begins.
    
				ADAM (cont'd)
		ACTION!
    
The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
    
On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him.
    
				HANK
		Yeah?
    
Adam pauses.
    
				ADAM
		Get Jason over here.
    
Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
    
				HANK
		Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
    
Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
    
				JASON
		Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

    
				ADAM
		This is the girl!
    
At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
He smiles at Adam.
    
				RAY
		Excellent choice, Adam.
    
Adam is sick with himself.
    
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
    
				BETTY
		Oh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
		promised a friend.
    
She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm
sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella.
    
Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
    
Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over
Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty
disappear out the sound stage door.

Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
    
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
    
				BETTY
		C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
    
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Hey!

    
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd)
		Hey, how's Sol?
    
				BETTY
		Sol?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		No ... not you...
			(to Rita)
		I'm sorry... I forget your name.
    
				RITA
			(almost inaudible)
		Rita.
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
		Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately.
		Tell him to come by the club.
    
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
    
				BETTY
		And what's your name?
    
				CORNELL DUMONT
			(big smile)
		Cornell Dumont.
    
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
    
				BETTY
			(whispering)
		Ask him who Sol is ...
    
Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Maybe he could help...
    
Betty follows Rita through the gate to the waiting cab. They
get in and the cab pulls away.

INT. CAB - DAY
    
Betty reaches and gently grabs Rita's shoulder. She speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

    
				BETTY
		Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
    
				RITA
			(whispering back)
		But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of
		Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why
		we shouldn't go see about Diane
		Selwyn... it's better not to get in
		trouble.
    
				BETTY
		You're not going to get in trouble.
		You're going to find out who you are.
		Finding out who you are gets you out of
		trouble.
    
Rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again.
    
							DISSOLVE TO:
    
INT. CAB - LATER
    
Betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand.
She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street.
    
				BETTY
		It should be around here...
    
Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(points)
		That's it ... 2590.
			(nudging Rita)
		Does it look familiar?
    
Rita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men
sitting in the front.
    
				RITA
		Don't stop!
    
				BETTY
		What is it? What do you see?!
    
				RITA
			(quietly - frantic)
		Those men in front, in the car.
    
				BETTY
		Do you know them?!

		No... but...

			(to driver)
		Keep going. Go around to the back.

EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENT - BACK ALLEY - DAY
    
Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
    
				BETTY
		Selwyn ... number 12.
    
They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		It's this way.
    
They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
    
Both girls dive for the bushes.
    
The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
			(panting whisper)
		Now, you've got me scared.
    
Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
    

He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		See, I told you there was nothing to be
		afraid of!
    
They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
    
				RITA
		Oh no ... don't.
    
Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
    
				RITA (cont'd)
		No one's ...
    
Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Yes?
    
				BETTY
		Diane?
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		Number 17.
    
				BETTY
		But it said #12.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		I switched apartments with her. She's in
		#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
		to the right.
    
The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		It's kind of hidden by the foliage.
    
Betty and Rita start to leave.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
		She hasn't been around for a few days ...

    
				BETTY
		Well ... we'll leave her a note.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
			(starting toward them)
		I'll go with you. She's still got some of
		my stuff.
    
The phone rings from inside her bungalow.
    
				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
			(turning back)
		Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.
    
The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
    
				BETTY
		I guess you're not Diane.
    
Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
    
They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Still not home I guess.
    
The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.
    
				RITA
		I don't think...
    
				BETTY
			(looking around for anyone
			watching)
		C'mon help me in. I'll open the front
		door.
    
				RITA
		No.
    
Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
    
				BETTY
		PUSH!!!

    
Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		Meet you at the door.
    
Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
    
				BETTY (cont'd)
		I don't know if you want to come in here
		or not. There's some kind of horrible
		smell like... something...
    
Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.

Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows.
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. They move
slowly, looking around at everything as they go. Betty looks
to Rita to see if any of this is something she remembers.
Rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.

Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream
starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.
    
In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.

The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard
something or not. She wonders, then turns and goes back to
her bungalow.
    
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.
    
Sounds, churning music.

Sounds, music churning continues.
    
Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding
the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets
Betty hold her. Music changes ...
    
				BETTY
		Rita... I know what you're doing.
    
				RITA
			(through uncontrollable sobs)
		What ... I..HAVE... to do.
    
				BETTY
		I know what you have to do, but let me do
		it.
    
Rita turns and looks up at Betty, her eyes red with crying.
Betty pulls her up facing her. Rita lets Betty take the
scissors. They look into each other's eyes. Betty gently
strokes Rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror. She has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.
Betty's reflection comes in beside Rita's. They stare at the

Wilkins still in his pajamas, bathrobe and slippers from

Jack Russell Terrier wakes and stands at the sound of the
phone ringing on a side table next to Wilkins. Wilkins comes
out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.

Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox
and removes her purse. She opens the purse and takes out the
money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.

		You've been so good to me ... now we know

Betty moves across the bed to the side of Rita. She puts her
arm around Rita and holds her.

black with fungus. It's eyes turn and they seem to be red.
